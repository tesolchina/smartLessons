L2 writing enjoyment

This study explores the relationships between task sequencing, task anxiety, task enjoyment, and second language (L2) writing development. While L2 writing is influenced by various factors, including task sequencing and learner-related variables, empirical evidence on the interactions between task sequencing and task emotions in L2 writing development is scarce. To address this gap, 75 L2 English students performed nine versions of three decision-making tasks in different sequences (simple to complex, complex to simple, or random) over nine weeks. The participants completed post-task questionnaires on their perceptions of the tasks, task anxiety, and task enjoyment, and their essays were analyzed for syntactic complexity, accuracy, lexical complexity, and fluency (CALF). Linear mixed-effect modeling examined the effect of task sequencing on CALF measures and task emotions. Results revealed that the simple-to-complex group had the best performance in CALF measures compared to other groups. Furthermore, the complex-to-simple group outperformed the random group in accuracy, lexical complexity, and fluency measures. Participants showed improved writing over time and experienced less task anxiety and more task enjoyment in the simple-to-complex group. Overall, this study suggests that task sequencing plays a crucial role in L2 writing development by improving learners' performance, enjoyment, while reducing anxiety.

# 1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been a surge in the popularity of task-based language teaching (TLT) as an approach that integrates language learning research and pedagogy (Abdi Tabari, 2021). Specificall, there has been significant interest in developing theoreticallysound approaches to task sequencing that can facilitate successful second language (L2) development. Despite the proposal of various models over the years, a consensus has not been reached on a set of criteria and procedures that have been empirically proven to be effective (Malicka, 2018). Likewise, Ells et a. (2020) have ientified the grading and sequencing of tasks as major challenges in TBLT. To address these sues, recent TBLT studies have attempted to test the fundamental theoretical claim of Robinson's (2010)

SSARC (Stabilize, Simplify, Automatize, Restructure, Complexify) model known as the currently most comprehensive and robust suggestion for sequencing tass to facilitate successul L2 development. The ssARC model, which is closely linked to the Cognition Hypothesi (CH) and the Triadic Componential Framework (TCF), i based on two fundamental claims: 1) sequencing decisions should be based solely on cognitive factors, and 2) tasks should be sequenced from simple to complex.

Several TBLT studies have used the ssARC model to examine the effects of task sequencing on L2 oral production (Baralt, 2014; Kim, 2020; Malicka, 2014, 2018; Santos, 2022). However, the efect oftask sequencing on L2 written production have been explored in relatively few studies (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022; Abdi Tabari & Miler, 2021; Lambert & Robinson, 2014; Levkina & Gilabert, 2014), and thetdis h grat mied findngs onthe effc f iffe ask sue on the stctic complet, accuracy, lexcal complexity, and fluency (CALF) of L2 writtn production. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, only two studies (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022; Allaw & McDonough, 2019) have investigated the role of task sequencing in L2 writing development over a short period and reported relatively inconclusive results.

Furthermore, previous TBLT studies have primarily operationalized task sequencing from a cognitive perspective and have not explored the impact of laners affective indvidual dfferenes (IDs). Consequently, it isdifficult to gain a clear understanding of the interaction between task sequencing and learners affctive IDs and their impact on L2 (written) production. In this regard, Dornye) (2019) has called for redressing the balance between cognitive and afecive factors in TBLT research, given the lck of ecological validity in TBLT research and the neglect of learners' affective factors, such as anxiety and enjoyment.

The present study aims to empiricall test the predictions of the ssARC model by examining the role of simple-to-complex, complex-to-simple, and random task sequencing in L2 writing development. To that end, participants performed a total of 3 decision-making tasks with 3 versions of varying complexity over a semester. For each of the 9 tasks, the study examines the CALF development of participants, as well as the extent to which L2 learners' anxiety and enjoyment are subject to the conditions under which tasks are sequenced and implemented in L2 writing classrooms.

# 2. Review of literature

# 2.1. Task sequencing: the SSARC model

Early conceptions of task sequencing suggested sequencing task acording to their complexity or difficulty. Prabu (1987) proposed arranging tasks through a "common sense of judgment of increasing complexity," from simplest to most dificult (p. 40). Candin (1987) expanded this idea by outlining criteria for sequencing tas, including cognitive load, communicative stres, code complexity, and interpretive density. Skehan (1996) also proposed sequencing tasks based on Candin's criteria, using information processing theory to help leaners balance fluency and accuracy in task outcomes and systematize language for ongoing use. Altenatively, Nunan (2004) focused onthe inguistic input in task content and suggeste sequencing tasks so that demands on the learner graduall increase based on input features like grammatical complexity, learner factors, and procedural factors.

The development of a valid task sequencing aproach initilly faced diffiulties due to insufficient clarity and empirical evidence in establishing critria (Long & Crookes, 1992). Malicka (2018) noted confusion in task design categories related to manipulable factors and external inluences beyond the task designer's control. Recently, Robinson's (2001, 2005, 2007) Cognition Hypothesis (CH) and Triadic Componential Framework (TCF) evolved into the SSARC model (Robinson, 2010, 2015, 2021) to address the need for theoretically driven, empiriclly supported, and pedagogically feasible critria for task sequencing. obinson's CH, grounded in functional and cognitive linguistic theory, posits that increasing the cognitive and communicative demands of tasks pushes learners to attain higher complexity and accuracy in L2 production. The simple-to-complex task sequence supports automaticity and cumulative learning, promoting L2 development as the tasks become more complex (Robinson, 2010, 2015).

In conjunction with the CH, Robinson's (2007) TCF classifies task characteristics into three categories: task conditions, task dif ficulty, and task complexity. Task conditions rfer to the factors afecting the type and quantit of interactions required i a task. Task difficult relates to learners abilities and emotional factors. Task complexit represents features that chllenge learners' cognitive resources and can be increased by manipulating resource-directing and resource-dispersing variables (Robinson, 2005) Resource-directing variables focus learner attention on the language needed for task completion (e.g., number of task elements and reasoning demands) while resource-dispersing variables impose cognitive demands without directing attention to linguistic features (e.g., planning time and task structure) (Abdi Tabari, 2023). The TCF offers a taxonomy to aid in task design and sequencing decisions, with a list of common variables adapted from Robinson and Gilabert (2007) (see Table B4 in online supplementary materials).

Robinson's CH and TCF models were refined into the sSARC model (Robinson, 2010, 2015), which outlines a viable aproach to task sequencing that i theoretical sound, empirically supported, and pedagogically practical. The ssAR model is guided by two sequencing principles considering both communicative and conceptual demands. The firs principle suggests sequencing tasks by varying cognitive complexity through manipulating resource-directing and resource-dispersing variables. The second principle states that learners should first tackle tasks that increase in complexity along resource-dispersing variables before moving to tasks that increase in complexity along resource-directing variables. This approach aims to improve learners fluency and automaticity, and then enhance their accuracy and complexity by directing their attention to relevant aspects of the L2 system (Robinson, 2007, 2015). Accordingly, the ssARC model presents a three-step task sequencing procedure for promoting interlanguage development described below:

: Step 1. SS (stabilize, simplify) $= \mathbf { i } \times \mathbf { e }$ [('s'rdisp) + (s'rdir)]n : Step 2. A (automatize) $= \mathbf { i } \times \mathbf { e }$ [(c'rdisp) $^ +$ ('s'rdir)]n

: Step 3. RC (restructure, complexify) $= \mathbf { i } \times \mathbf { e }$ [('c'rdisp) + (c'rdir)]

Notes. $\mathbf { i } =$ current interlanguage state; ${ \mathsf { e } } =$ mental effort; $\mathbf { \partial } ^ { \bullet } \mathbf { s } ^ { \prime } = \mathbf { \partial }$ simple task demands; $\mathbf { \epsilon } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { c } ^ { \prime } =$ complex task demands; rdisp $=$ resource-dispersing dimensions of tasks; rdir $=$ resource-directing dimensions of tasks; and $\mathbf { n } =$ the potential number of practice opportunities on tasks, which are determined in situ by teachers observing pedagogic task performance.

The first ste, Stabilize and Simplify, stabilizes and engages learners' current interlanguage in simple tasks. The second step, Automatize, increases tak complexity along resource-dispersing variables to promote automatization and quicker acessto learners interlanguage. In the third step, Restructure and Complexify, task complexity is raised along both resource-dispersing and resourcedirecting variables to destabilize and restructure learners' interlanguage systems, further complexifying their interlanguage. This model aims to promote interlanguage development through shifts in task complexity, recognizing the dynamic nature of language learning, in line with Complex Dynamic Systems Theory (Larsen-Freeman, 2011).

# 2.2. Task sequencing and L2 task performance

Robinson's ssARC model offrs a theoreticall sound aproach to task sequencing for designing language curricula; however, its effectiveness in promoting language development has yet to be empirically confirmed. Previous studies of the model iffer in task modality (oral or written), task sequences (simple-complex, complex-simple), and manipulated task complexity factors (resource directing and/or resource-dispersing), with mixed findings regarding is effctivenessin promoting language development. Studies comparing simple-to-complex sequencing to other methods have explored various aspects of L2 development, including specific linguistic dimensions (Levkina & Gilabert, 2014), language-related episodes (LREs; Baralt, 2014), and overal performance (Malicka, 2014, 2018).

Various studies have examined the impact of different task sequencing configurations on L2 oral development. Robinson (2001) compared oral map tass and found that a simple-to-complex sequence resulted in greater accuracy, while a complex-to-simple sequence led to greater fluency. Malicka, (2014, 2018) explored the effects of simple-to-complex, randomized, and individual task sequences on L2 oral production by manipulating complexity along resource-directing variables. Malicka (2014) did not find significant differences between the simple-to-complex and random sequencing groups, but Malicka (2018) found that simple-to-complex task sequencing improved speech rate, accuracy, and structural complexity compared to individual task performance. Kim (2020) also investigated the effcts of task sequences on L2 English leaners oral production, focusing on simple-complex sequencing. She found that tass following Robinson's (2010) ssARC model resulted in beter syntactic complexity. Santos (2022) examined sequencing effets on Chine nrs f Porgue findig inificant accuracy differences but nt in complexty or fluncy. Fiall, Baralt (2014) explored simple-complex task sequences on L2 Spanish development, suggesting more complex tasks may be more effective in promoting L2 development.

Unlike L2 speaking, there have been few L2 writing studies on the effects of Robinson's (2010) SSARC model. Levkina and Gilabert (2014) investigated diferent sequences (simple-complex, complex-simple, and randomized) manipulating task complexity along two resource-directing variables ( $\pm$ spatial reasoning; $\pm$ perspective-taking) on the retention of spatial expressions by English learners over time. The results indicated that complex-to-simple sequencing resulted in greater short-term retention of spatial expressions, while simple-complex sequencing led to greater long-term retention measured by delayed post-tests. Additionall, Lambert and Robinson (2014) examined the effects of simple-complex and randomized task sequencing on L2 written production of narrative summary tasks. They manipulated tasks along resource-directing variables ( $\pm$ few elements; $\pm$ reasoning demands) and resource-dispersing variables ( $\pm$ planning; $\pm$ prior knowledge; $\pm$ number of steps; $\pm$ multi-tasking). Although the SSARC group did not differ significantly from the control group, the simple-to-complex task sequence led to greater long-term improvement i overall task performance.

In another study, Allaw and McDonough (2019) tested the efect of simple-complex versus complex-simple sequences on L2 written production of French learners by manipulating both resource-directing ( $\pm$ spatial reasoning) and resource-dispersing variables $( \pm$ task structure). Both sequences resulted in improvements in lexical diversity, grammatical accuracy, and fluency, but the simple-complex sequence led to greater overallpeformance and long-term L2 improvement. Abdi Tabari and Miller (2021) recently investigated the impact of task sequencing on L2 written production of decision-making tasks, manipulated by resource-dispersing $( \pm$ planning time) and resource-directing ( $\pm$ few elements) variables. The study found that the simple-complex sequence group produced L2 writing with higher levels of syntactic and lexical complexity, grammatical accuracy, and flency than the individual task groups. Abdi Tabari and Cho (2022) also examined the effects of simple-complex sequencing versus individual task performance of tasks at different complexity levels on L2 written production with decision-making tasks manipulated by both resource-dispersing ( $\pm$ planning time) and resource-directing ( $\pm$ few elements) complexity variables. Their results indicated that the simple-complex sequence group outperformed the complex-simple group overallin terms of syntactic complexity and grammatical accuracy over a short perio.

Reviewing the studies on L2 oral and written development reveals the impact of task sequencing. Robinson (2001) found that a simple-complex sequence enhance oral accuracy, whileMalicka, (2014, 2018) suports the efficacy of simple-to-complex sequencing, improving speech rate and structural complexity. Kim (2020) demonstrated that tasks sequenced with Robinson's sSARC model enhance L2 English learners oral syntactic complexity, and Santos (2022) reported significant accuracy improvement for Chinese learners of Portuguese with a simple-complex sequence. In L2 writing, Levkina and Gilabert (2014) showed that complex-to-simple sequencing enhances short-term retention, and Lambert and Robinson (2014) found that a simple-to-complex task sequence im proves long-term performance. Allaw and McDonough (2019) reported improvements for both simple-complex and complex-simple sequences in French learners' writing, with the former leading to greater overall performance. Recent studies by Abdi Tabari and

Cho (2022); Abdi Tabari and Millr (2021) consistently show that a simple-complex sequence outperforms other sequences in L2 written production of decision-making tasks, indicating higher syntactic complexity, grammatical accuracy, and fluency over a short period.

The variability in findings across studies exploring L2 oral and written development can be aributed to a range of factors. Methodological diffrence, including variations in task design, participant characterisics, and asessment criteria, contribute to nuanced results (Baralt et al., 2014). Individual differences among learners, such as proficiency levels and prior language learning experiences, may influence responses to specific task sequencing configurations (Allaw & McDonough, 2019). The dynamic nature of language aqusition, coupled with the interconnectedness of linguistic skill, also adds complexity to interpreting outcomes (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022). Lastly, contextual factors surrounding the learning environment, including instructional methods, cultural in. fluences, and institional settings, may lay a role in divers inings. Thee extenal factrs can shape thefftivenesf ctin ask sequencing approaches, adding complexity to result interpretation (Elli et al., 2020). Overall, diverse findings in L2 oral and written development studies stem from a combination of methodological, individual, and contextual factors inherent in the language acquisition process.

Building on previous research (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022; Abdi Tabari & Millr, 2021; Allaw & McDonough, 2019; Lambert & Robinson, 2014) and addressing call for more longitudinal studies on L2 writers performance under diffrent task sequencing conditions (Ellis et al., 2020; Robinson, 2021), the current study employs the ssARC model to examine how L2 writers develop different aspects (CALF) of their writing over a semester and tes the prediction that simple-complex sequencing is superior to other sequences in L2 writing.

# 2.3. Writing and task-specific L2 anxiety

L2 writing anxiet is a skill-specific construct (Cheng et al., 199) distinct from general foreign language classoom anxiety (Horwitz et al., 1986). It is defined as \*a relatively stable anxiety disposition associated with L2 writing", characterized by "dysfunctional thoughts, increased physiological arousal, and maladaptive behaviors" (Cheng, 2004, p. 319), which is measured with the self-report instrument Second Language Writing Anxiety Inventory (SLwAI; Cheng, 2004). The instrument measures the three respective dimensions of L2 writing anxiety, namely cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and avoidance behavior. Using the SLWAI, researchers have predominantly examined the role of L2 writing anxiety in leaners L2 achievement (e.g, Cheng, 2004), establishing a mid-sized negative relationship between the two variables (Teimouri et al., 2019). Surprisingly, however, research on the role of L2 writing anxiety in learners L2 writing task performance and L2 written production remains largely unexplored (MacIntyre & Wang, 2022; Papi et al., 2022). Only reently, scholars started to investigat the relationship between 2 writing anxiety, different aspects of writing tasks, task implementation, and learners' written productions. For example, Saeedi and Farnia (2017) found a significant negative rlationshi between learners L2 writing anxiety and CAF measures in atimed narrative writing tak concluding that anxiety negatively afected allaspects of learners written production. Zabihi et al. (2020) investigated the efect of L2 writing anxiety on L2 writing performance comparatively in narrative and argumentative writing tasks, finding greater effects in the argumentative genre. Rahimi and Zhang (2018) focused on the role of task complexity in their examination of L2 writing anxiety and L2 writing perfrmance. They used a simple and a complex argumentative task, which they sequenced from simple to complex, and found a significant effect for L2 writing anxiety and syntactic complexity but not for accuracy in the complex task. The authors posit that the lack of association between anxiety and accuracy might hint at a competition for attentional resources between syntactic complexity and accuracy in more complex tasks (e.g., Skehan, 2014), and claim that anxiety manifests more clearly in complex tasks, though they do not comment on the role of task sequencing concerning this finding.

More recently, Jiang (2021) argued that tass are temporary and situated, which needs to be reflected in operationalizations and tools that measure tak-related constructs, such as task anxiety. She distinguishes task anxiety from L2 writing anxiety, defining it as the situated and temporary level of L2 learners' anxiety when participating in tasks. In her study of motivation, emotional variables, and task peformance in Chinese EFL learners, Jiang (2021) investigated anxiety in the context f oral tasks. Results did neither show a significant relationship between task anxiety and (oral) task performance nor did learners' task anxiety predict (oral) task perfor. mance. These unexpected findings are linked to participants high levels of positie emotions, which potentially mitigatd the efect of anxiety on task performance, and to the young age of participants. Zhang's (2019) meta-analysis of L2 anxiety and performance similarly found a weaker link between oral task performance and anxiet for younger leaners. However, Kormos et al.'s (2020) study of task anxiety as a dimension of task motivation in computer-administered integrative listening-speak and listening-write tasks revealed that young learners' anxiety did not have a significant relationship to task performance.

Considering that traditional L2 writing anxiety captures a stable disposition, the use of a task-specific construct could yield new insights into the dynamic role of situated anxiety in written task performance, especially when the different levels of task complexity and adult learners are investigated over time. However, to date, no study has investigated how learners' L2 writig task anxiety varies in relation to the sequencing of L2 writing tasks with different levels of complexity nor how it impacts L2 written production.

# 2.4. Writing and task-specific L2 enjoyment

In recent years, the positive turn in SLA (Macintyre et al., 2016) has led to a surge in interest in the role of positive emotions in the language lerning process. One emotion that has rceived much attention is foreign language enjoyment (FLE; Bote et al., 2022). FLE is defined as the oy and pleasure leaners experience when learning or using a language (Teimouri, 2017) and it s concetualized as a dynamic variable (Dewaele & Dewaele, 2017) that encompases multiple dimensions beyond joy and pleasure, such as intellectual focus, heightened atention, and optimal challenge (Boudreau et al., 2018). In general education, enjoyment is understood as fling satisfied with one's participation in an activity (Ainley & Hidi, 2014) and scholars have linked it to confidence and strong coping abilities in the face of challenges (Izard, 1977). In recent SLA studies, FLE has ben found to increase learners' willingnes to communicate (Khajavy et al., 2018), enhance learner motivation (e.g., Pekrun et al., 2007), and positively affect performance (Dewaele & Alfawzan, 2018).

Similar to anxiety, FLE has been reconceptualized as a sil-specific construct. Specificall, L2 writing enjoyment has een defined as \*learners' experience of joy and pleasure while writing in a second language" (Papi et al., 2022, p. 383). To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have used this construct to investgate its role in L2 achievement and written performance. Tahmouresi and Papi (2021) used course grades and an adapted 4-item scale measuring joy (Teimouri, 2017) to examine the assciation between L2 writing enjoyment and achievement. The authors found that L2 writing enjoyment unexpectedly did not predict achievement nor was there asignificant relationship betwen the variables. I contrast, Zhu et al. (2022) used an integrated arumentative writing task (i. tas that require eaners t deploy skill byond writing e., reading to complet the task) to explore the relationship between L2 writing enjoyment and task performance. In this study, task performance was asessed using the rubrics contextual awarenes, citation and synthesis, opinion and argument, and organization and expression, while L2 writing enjoyment was measured with a general FLE instrument (Saito et al., 2018). Findings showed that L2 writing enjoyment functioned as a mediator between learner motivation and performance and only had a moderate direct effect on task performance. No conclusive insights into the role of L2 writing enjoyment in L2 written task performance can be drawn from these limited studies.

While researchers started to explore enjoyment as a sil-specific variable, no validated measurement tools have been developed and employed in empirical studies. Recently, however, Jiang (2021) introduced the construct of task enjoyment, which captures learners' dynamically changing enjoyment levels when performing a task. The construct reflects task dimensions of temporality and situatedness and accounts for the dynamic nature of enjoyment and is context-dependency. It is measured with five items (e.g., I enjoyed doing thetask), each of which is rated on a 6-point Likert-type scale that ranges from not at all(1) to very much (6). To our knowledge, this construct and itscorresponding instrument have only been used in one study that examined the role of task enjoyment in L2 oral task performance, which was assessed by the rubric of the TOEFL independent speaking tasks (i.e., delivery, language use, and content development) (Jiang, 2021). Findings showed a significant positive corrlation between task enjoyment and task per. formance and revealed that L2 enjoyment positively predicted oral task performance when selfrated proficiency was considered a covariate. These results raise the question of what role task enjoyment plays in L2 written performance when tas are sequenced in varying orders of complexity.

# 2.5. Purpose of the study

The current study is motivated by previous research that has investigated how task sequencing afects L2 writing (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022; Lambert & Robinson, 2014) and the lack f longitudinal studies on how L2 learners perform under ifferent task sequencing conditions over time Ellis e al., 2020; Robinson, 2021). Furthermore, the study reponds to Donyei's (2019) cal for TB reearchto balance cognitive and affective factors. To achieve these objectives, the study employs the ssARC model to examine whether simple-complex sequencing scaffolds L2 learners' written linguistic development i.e, CALF) more efectively than alternatie se. quences, to investigate the impact of task sequencing on L2 writing task anxiety and enjoyment, and to explore potential interactions between task sequencing, CALF measures, task anxiety, and enjoyment. Therefore, the study is guided by the following research questions:

RQ1: How does task sequencing affect the CALF of L2 writing development?   
RQ2: What is the effect of task sequencing on L2 writing task anxiety?   
RQ3: What is the effect of task sequencing on L2 writing task enjoyment?   
RQ4: What is the relationship between L2 writing task emotions (task anxiety and task enjoyment) and CALF measures?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Participants

The study involved 75 students (35 males and 40 females) in an upper-intermediate collgiate ESL writing course in the United States. They attended 12 weeks of 1.45-hour sessions over one semester, with different sections of the course taught by the same teacher who followed a task-base syllabus and used similar teaching materils. Participants came from different first-language backgrounds, including Korean (18 participants), Spanish (16 participants), Portuguese (14 participants), French (9 participants), Russian (7 participants), Arabic (6 participants), and Farsi (5 participants). They were between 18 and 21 years old $\mathbf { M } = 1 9 . 2$ $\mathbf { S D = }$ 1.73) and had lived in an English-speaking country for one to three years $( \mathbf { M } = 1 . 5$ $\mathbf { S D } = 2 . 1 9$ . Participants had completed between two and seven ESL writing courses $( \mathbf { M } = 4 . 0 0$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 9 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ . Their IELTS writing scores fell within the 5.0-6.0 range, corresponding to the B2 (upper-intermediate) level according to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) standard for evaluation. This consistent scoring underscored the homogeneity in participants writing proficiency before starting the writing sesions. To ensure assesment precision and to confirm writing proficiency level, the course teacher and the first author jointly reviewed participants writing profiles before data collction. Additionall, all participants underwent a university writing placement test before being allocated to different sections of the course. Before data collection, ethical consents were obtained and approved by the Instutional Review Board (IRB) of the first author's university.

# 3.2. Writing tasks

The study included three decision-making tasks, each with three respective versions, differing in one resource-directing feature $( \pm$ number of task elements) and one resource-dispersing feature ( $\pm$ planning time) of task complexity (Robinson, 2015). The decision-making task type was integrated into the ESL writing course for its manifold advantages. It provides a practical context, allowing lerners to employ their linguistc ailitie i real-life situations, it actively stimulates critical thinking and problem-solving skills fostering heightened cognitive engagment, and i encourages learners to articulate ther thoughts and opinions, cultivating the development of argumentative and persuasive writing skills (Abdi Tabari, Sato, & Wang, 2023).

Importantly, this task type directly correlated with target tasks in the ESL course, which were centered around decision-making. The course aimed to prepare students for their ultimate goal of applying language skils in real-lifesituations that requir critical thinking, efective problem-solving, and communication, using decision-making tass as avital bridge between clssroom learning and the practicalapplication of language sils. Our rationale was to closely align the nature of the tasks in the ES writing course with the specific challenges and demands inherent in the tasks the students would encounter in the current study.

The task versions and their complexity levels were designed based on the ssARC model principles (Table 1). The number of task elements was either increased or decreased to manipulate the resource-directing feature while planning time was either given or not given to manipulate the resource-dispersing feature. The three tasks had a similar format but differed in topic. For the first task, different holiday destinations within the United States were described, and the number of destinations varied across the three task versions. The second task described various job candidates for a software enginering position, and the number of candidates differed across the the task versions. The third task resented decritions of difrent student applications for universt scholarships, and the number of students differed across the three task versions.

In Step 1, participants were required to decide on the two most suitable holiday destinations (Task 1), job candidates (Task 2), or university scholarship recipients (Task 3) based on the information presented in the writing tasks. Participants were given a10-minute planning time before starting the writing task (Abdi Tabari, 2021, 2022). This pre-task planning time aimed to reduce the cognitive load on participants working memory and enable them to concentrate on various aspects of each writing task and the lower number of task elements (four) aimed to simplify the input according to the first step of the sSARC model.

The medium task version was made more cognitively complex by increasing resource-dispersing factors (Robinson, 2010) according to Step 2 of the sAR model. Specificall, task elements and instructions i. choosing two out of four-holiday destinations job applicants, or scholarship applicants) remained the same, while participants were not given pre-task planning time to heighten the cognitive complexity of the task and facilitate the automation of the writing proces. In this way, participants had to generate ideas similar to those in the simple task, but the absence of pre-task planning time raised the cognitive complexity of the task and imposed greater demands on their working memory.

In Step 3, participants were presented with ix-holiday destinations, six job candidates' applications, and six scholarship applicants qualifications, and were asked to select the two best options. As with Step 2, they were not provided with pre-task planning time. The increase in the number of elements, along with the absence of planning time, heightened the cognitive complexity of the task, placing pressure on participants to process and analyze i elements, generate and articulate thir ideas, and plan their writig performance while writing. This increase in cognitive complexity was consistent with the third step of the ssARC model (Robinson, 2010), which suggests that tas that are more cognitively complex in terms of both resource-directing and resource-dispersing factors will promote the use of new linguistic structures and increase language production complexity.

# 3.3. Perception questionnaire

The perception questionnaire verified whether the manipulation of cognitive complexity levels in nine different task versions was successful (Revesz et al., 2016). The 75 participants rated the nine task versions based on perceived difficulty, mental effor, stress level, planning time pressure, and writing time pressure. Aditionally, 15 experts rated the overall perceived difficulty and level of mental effrt, which were considered the most relevant items. The questionnaire used a nine-point Likert scale adapted from Lee (2018), and mean ratings for all task versions are presented in Table B1 in online supplementary materials. The questionnaire also comprised open-ended questions seeking expert' views on factor leading to variation in lels of overalldifficulty or mental effort between particular tasks.

# 3.4. L2 task emotion questionnaires

Considering the longitudinal design of the study and the importance of capturing temporary and situated anxiety and enjoyment over time, we decided to use Jiang's (2021) task anxiety and task enjoyment scales, which we adapted for writing tasks (see Appendix A in online supplementary materials).

# 3.5. Procedure

Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: 25 to the simple-to-complex group (StC), 25 to the complex-to-simple group (Cts), and the remaining 25 to the random group (Random). Over nine weeks, participants engaged in decision-making tasks, with each task having thre versions clasified as simple, medium, and complex. These tasks were integral components of their curriculum, strategicall designed to assess cognitive performance. The order in which participants completed the task versions varied. This approach was implemented to minimize potential biases associated with task sequence and to enhance the internal validity of the findings. The time allocated for each version was determined through a pilot study involving 25 participants of the same proficiency level. In the pilot study, the fastest participant completed the simple, medium, and complex versions in 25, 28, and $3 3 \mathrm { m i n }$ , respectively, whil the slowest took 30, 36, and 42 min. Rather than using time-on-task as a measure of cognitive load, the time limit for each version was set based on the slowestparticipant's completion time, ensuring consistent pressure acrossallparticipants (Abdi Tabari, 2023). This approach aimed to enhance the accuracy of performance asessment with increasing cognitive complexity. Following the SSARC model, the first group completed three versions of each task in a simpleto-complex order over three weeks, with a one-week break between task sets. They completed a total of nine tass over nine weeks. The second group followed a similar pattern but ina complex-to-simple order. Partcipants in the random group completed allnine task versions under the same conditions as the other two sequencing groups over the same period. To prevent repetition, the sequence of task versions for the random group was changed randomly each week (see Table 2).

Participants engaged in writing tasks within a standard classroom setting, using classoom computers for typing essays, and adhering to the prohibition of external resources such as dictionaries. This restriction underscored the importance of evaluating participants genuine writing performance. Throughout the tasks, participants were closely monitored, with internet accessrestricted by locking the browsing search on each computer. Aditionally, participants were required to type within a digital space marked with colored bars indicating task duration. Once the allocated time lapsed, the digital space froze, preventing further typing. This combination of measures aimed to ensure a controlled and standardized environment during the writing tasks. Finall, participant in all three groups completed perception questionnaires, post-task anxiety, and post-task enjoyment questionnaires immediately afer each writing task. The duration for flling out these questionnaires was aproximately 25 minutes, and responses were collected via Qualtrics.

# 3.6. CALF metrics

To evaluate the quality of L2 writing samples, we used the CALF framework (Housen et al., 2012; Norris & Ortega, 2009), which breaks down L2 writing proficiency into four subsystems: syntactic complexity, accuracy, lexical complexity, and writing fluency. We selected commonly used metrics for each subsystem. For syntactic complexity, we chose the mean length of T-unit (MLT), dependent clauses per T-unit (DC/T), and complex nominals per T-unit (CN/T) as measured by the L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) system (Lu, 2010). To capture writing accuracy, we used the proportio of eror-free clauses (EFCs) and the proportio of correct verb forms (CVFs). For lexical complexity, we used the measure of textual lexical diversty (MTLD) and mean word frequency (WRD), which measures lexical sophistication. Lastly, we used words per minute (W/M) as a measure f fluency. Before analysis, we checked for formatting erors and spellng mistakes, and we used automated text analyzers (Synlex and Coh-Metrix 3.0) to asst withcalculating the syntactic and lexical complexity metrics.

# 3.7. Data analysis

The essay analysis involved several steps. First, the essays were analyzed using computerized tols to measure syntactic and lexical complexity and fluency. Then, acuracy was manuall measured by the first researcher, who calculated the percntage of clauses that were not erroneous (EFCs). Errors in the essays were marked and any syntactic, morphological, and lexical form that was "nonexistent in English or indisputably inappropriate was counted (Skehan & Foster, 1997, p. 195). However, rrors in capitalization, spelling, and punctuation were ignored following the guidelines of Wigglesworth and Storch (2009). The percentage of CVFs in the participants essays was calculated by identifying alverbs that were correctly used concerning tense, aspect, voice, modality, and subject-verb agreement, dividing the total number of correct verb forms by the total number of verbs used in each essay, and multiplying the result by 100. To establish inter-coder reliability, $4 0 \%$ of the essays were re-coded and re-rated by an expert colleague, and Cohen's kappa showed strong intercoder agreement for both accuracy metrics $\mathbf { \tilde { x } } = . 9 3$ [EFCs] and $\kappa = . 9 4$ [CVFs]).

Note. StC $=$ Simple-to-Complex Group, CtS $=$ Complex-to-Simple Group, and Random $=$ Random Order Group

Next, we used linear mixed-effect modeling in the $R$ statistical package $R$ Core Team, 2022) to answer the first three research questions. Linear mixed-efect modeling allows for handling both fixed and random effcts (Linck & Cunnings, 2015). We had three task versions (ie, simple, medium, and complex) within each stage (a total f three stages, see Table 2). Therefore, stages rresent the average performance across the thre task versions. In other words, a stage is a composite measure that takes into ccount the results from the simple, mid, and complex versions of a specific writing task. This allowed us to examine how much gain participants had Iongitudinally across thre tages. Consequently, we uilt 10 mixed-effct models fr the CALF measures and emotions which served as our deendent variables. In each model, task sequencing groups i.e, StC, Cts, and Random) and Stages (i.e., Stages 1,2, and 3) were entered as fixed efects. We included participants as random factors. To run linear mixed-ffects models, we used the merTest package using the Kenward-Roger method. When obtaning a significant effct, we examined the individual effect for each main effect using Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons with the emmeans package. Finall, we used the MuMIn package to calculate marginal $R ^ { 2 }$ and conditional $R ^ { 2 }$

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Perception questionnaire

Descriptive statistics of participants' self-rated task perception (see Table B1 in Online Supplementary Materials) show that participants perceived the complex task versions as more difficult, cognitivelyeffortful, and stressful, requiring more time for planning and writing than the medium and simple versions. Participants also perceived the medium task versions as more challenging, mentally demanding, and stressful, and exerting more time pressure for planning and writing than the simpl versions, but lesso than the complex versions. Finally, the simple versions were perceived as the least dificult, requring the least cogntive efort and causing the least amount of tres and pressure during planning and writing. In addition, the expert ratings exhibited a similar patten to that of the participants, with the simple ersions receiving lower rating for overall ifficulty and mental efort than the medium and comple task versions (see Table B1 in Online Supplementary Materials). Given the large $F$ values for complexity in comparison with much smaller $F$ values for the task and task $\times$ complexity (see Table B2 in online supplementary materials), it can be claimed that task complexity was the major fctor influencing cognitie complexity. Overal, theselfratings demonstrated a consistent pattern that confirmed the as sumptions made about cognitive complexity in task design.

# 1.2. The effect of task sequencing on CALF measures and task emotion:

To answer RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, we firs examined the overall main ffect and the overall interaction effect for CALF measures and emotions. The results of linear mixed-efect models can be seen in Table 3. Descriptive statistics for CALF measures and emotions are displayed in Fig. 1 (see also Table B3 in online supplementary materials).

Regarding Group, findings showed a significant difference between StC and CtS $\langle t = 1 2 . 5 4$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ ) and between StC and Random $( t = 1 0 . 7 0 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ groups, indicating that the StC group $( \mathbf { M } = 2 . 7 5$ ) experienced less anxiety in their writing tasks than CtS $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 4 6 )$ and Random groups $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 3 5 )$ . Concerning Stage, we found a significant difference between Stage 1 and 2 $\left( t = 8 . 0 8 \right.$ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ , Stage 1 and 3 $( t = 2 6 . 2 0 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , and Stage 2 and 3 $t = 1 8 . 3 7$ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ , indicating that participants experienced more anxiety in Stage 1 $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 6 3 $ than in Stage 2 $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 3 2 ) $ and Stage 3 $\mathbf { M } = 2 . 6 0 $ . Moreover, participants experienced more anxiety in Stage 2 than in Stag 3. Regarding the interaction effect, the results indicated that there was a signficant dfference between tage 1 and 2 (StC: $t = 6 . 7 0$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; CtS: $t = 4 . 0 9$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; Random: $t = 3 . 2 1$ $p = . 0 0 5 )$ I, Stage 1 and 3 (StC: $t = 2 2 . 0 0$ 3 $p < . 0 0 1$ ; CtS: $t = 1 2 . 5 2$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; Random: $t = 1 1 . 1 5$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ , and Stage 2 and 3 (StC: $t = 1 5 . 3 0$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; CtS: $t = 8 . 7 8$ 3 $p < . 0 0 1$ ; Random: $t = 7 . 9 4$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ ) in all three groups. This means that participants in all three groups experienced more anxiety in Stage 1 than in Stage 2 and 3. Moreover, they experienced more anxiety in Stage 2 than in Stage 3 (see Fig. 1).

We also examined Group differences in each Stage. In Stage 1, we found a significant difference between StC and CtS $( t = 6 . 0 3$ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ , StC and Random $( t = 3 . 6 0$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ , and CtS and Random $( t = 2 . 4 3$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = . 0 4 8 ) } \end{array}$ groups, meaning that in Stage 1, the StC group experienced lessanxiety than CtS and Random groups. Moreover, the CtS group experienced more anxiety than the Random group (Fig. 1). In Stage 2, we found a significant difference between StC and CtS $( t = 8 . 2 6$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ and between StC and Random $( t = 6 . 5 7$ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ groups, meaning that in Stage 2, the StC group experienced less anxiety than CtS and Random groups (Fig. 1).

Regarding Stage, we found a significant difference between Stage 1 and 2 $( t = 5 . 5 8$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ , Stage 1 and 3 $( t = 2 3 . 3 7$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ , and Stage 2 and 3 $( t = 1 7 . 7 9$ $p < . 0 0 1 \ r$ , suggesting that participants experienced more enjoyment in Stage 3 $( \mathbf { M } = 4 . 1 1$ ) than in Stage 1 $\mathbf { M } = 3 . 3 6 $ and Stage 2 $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 5 4 ) ,$ , and more enjoyment in Stage 2 than in Stage 1. Regarding the intrction effect, the results indicated that in llthre groups, there was a signficant difference be. tween Stage 1 and 3 (StC: $t = 2 7 . 9 5$ A $p < . 0 0 1$ ; CtS: $t = 1 0 . 0 5 , p < . 0 0 1$ ; Random: $t = 2 . 4 8 , p = . 0 4 3 )$ , and Stage 2 and 3 (StC: $t = 2 0 . 1 4$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; CtS: $t = 6 . 4 8$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; Random: $t = 4 . 1 9$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ . Moreover, except for the Random group, there was a significant difference between Stages 1 and 2 (StC: $t = 7 . 8 1$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; CtS: $t = 3 . 5 7$ $p = 0 0 2 \mathrm { \cdot }$ . Put differently, participants in all three groups experienced more enjoyment in Stage 3 than in Stage 2 and 1, and more enjoyment in Stage 2 than in Stage 1 for StC and CtS groups (Fig. 1). We also examined Group differences in each Stage. In Stage 1, we found asignificant difference between StC and Cts $( t = 5 . 0 0$ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ and between CtS and Random $\mathbf { \zeta } t = 3 . 7 4$ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ groups, meaning that in Stage 1, the CtS group experienced less enjoyment than both StC and Random groups (Fig. 1). In Stage 2, we found a significant difference between StC and CtS $( t = 8 . 3 0$ $p < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \AA }$ and between StC and Random $( t = 8 . 6 7 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ groups, meaning that the StC group experienced more enjoyment than CtS and Random groups (Fig. 1). Finally, in Stage 3, we found a significant difference between StC and CtS $\left( t = 1 8 . 9 3 \right.$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ and between StC and Random $\mathbf { \tilde { \mu } } _ { t } = 2 1 . 0 8$ $p < . 0 0 1 )$ groups, meaning that the StC group experienced more enjoyment than both CtS and Random groups in Stage 3 (Fig. 1).

# 4.3. Correlations between CALF measures and task emotions

To answer RQ4, we examined the correlations between CALF measures and task emotions. We report the correlations for the combined groups given the small samplesizes per group (Table 4). Data show that as we move from Stage 1 to Stage 3, more significant correlations are obtained. In Stage 1, we had a marginal negative correlation between MLT and anxiety. This negative corrlation increased in size at Stage 2 and again at Stage 3. Moreover, we found positive correations between MLT and enjoyment at Stages 2 and 3. No significant correlations were found between DC/T and either of the task emotions at Stages 1, 2, and 3. For CN/T, we found negative correlations with anxiet at Stages 1, 2, and 3. The size of the relationship increased in size at Stage 3. A similar pattern was found between CN/T and enjoyment and the size of the relationship increased at Stage 3. For accuracy measures, we found a negative correlation between EFC and anxiet at ll three Stages that graduall increased from Stage 1 to Stage 3. Moreover, a positive correlation between EFC and enjoyment was obtained at Stages 2 and 3. For CVF, we found negative correlations with anxiet at Stages 2 and 3. The size of the rlationship graduall icreased in size from Stage 1 to Stage 3. Similarl, there was a positive corrlation between CVF and enjoyment at Stages 2 and 3.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. Effects of task sequencing on syntactic complexity

The results of this study demonstrate that task sequencing significantly impacts the syntactic complexity of L2 writing development, as measured by Mean Length of T-Unit (MLT), Dependent Clause per T-Unit (DC/T), and Complex Nominals per T-Unit (CN/T) Specificall, the StC group produced longer T-units in their writing than both the Cts and Random groups, sugesting that beginning with simpler tasks and gradualy increasing complexity can lead to greater syntactic complexity. However, there was no significant difference between the Cts and Random groups, indicating that task sequencing alone may not be the sole factor affcting syntactic complexity development. The study also found that participants exhibited increased skillat the subclausal level as they progressed in their L2 writing development. Specifically, the StC group used more complex noun phrases compared to both the CtS and Random groups. These findings are consistent with prior studies that have demonstrated the significant impact of task sequencing on different indices of syntactic complexity in L2 writing (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022; Abdi Tabari & Millr, 2021; Allaw & McDonough, 2019) However, the study by Lambert and Robinson (2014) appear to differ from thee findings, indicating that variations in task sequences or populations studied may contribute to differing results.

Interpreting these findings through Robinson's (2010) ssARC model, task sequencing can play a crucial role in enhancing the complexity and robustness of L2 writing. Gradually incrasing task complexity facilitates the development of learners' cognitive processing ailities, consistent with the model's emphasis on gradually increasing task complexity. Additionally, the finding that participants exhibited increased skillin subclausal level writing as they progressed in their L2 writing development aligns with the model's emphasis on gradually increasing task abstraction. However, the lack of significant ifference between the CtS and Random groups suggests that task sequencing alone may not be suficient for promoting syntactic complexity, and other factors may also contribute to learners cognitive processing abilities. This finding is consistent with the model's emphasis on the importance of multiple factors i shaping cognitie processig abilities, such as writig instruction, L2 proficiency level,first language (1) writing ability, age of onset of L2 acquisition, and individual differences (e.g., motivation, working memory capacity, atentional control). Overall, the findings afirm the substantial influence of task sequencing on the syntactic complexity of L2 writing development aligning with the sARC model's principle of progresively elevating task complexity and abstraction to enhance cognitive processing abilities. Moreover, heightened task complexity, particularly when associated with an increased number of elements, influenced measures of syntactic complexity.

# 5.2. Effects of task sequencing on accuracy

Regarding accuracy,significant main effects of Group and Stage on EFCs in L2 writing were found. The StC group utilized more EFCs than both CtS and Random groups, while the CtS group used more EFCs than the Random group. Additionally, participants used more EFCs in Stage 3 than in Stages 1 and 2. These findings align with Robinson's (2010) SSARC model, suggesting tass should be sequenced from simple to complex and from controlled to les controlled. In writing instruction, this implies introducing basc kils before progressing to more complex ones. Furthermore, instruction should scaffold students gradually from contrlled to less controlled tass (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022). We also found significant main efects of Group and Stage for CVFs. The StC group employed more CVFs compared to CtS and Random groups. Participants used more CVFs in Stage 3 than in Stages 1 and 2. These findings align with Robinson's ssARC model, suggesting an escalation of cognitive complexity enhances attention to form-function associations, contributing to a more advanced L2 knowledge system (Robinson, 2021). Finall, the observed increase in CVFs in the StC group during more complex stages hints at heightened cognitive demands. While StC sequencing enhances cognitive engagement and fosters deeper processing, there is a need to consider the balance between challenge and potential overload. Acknowledging this equilibrium is crucial for optimizing task sequencing. Additionall, these findingsoffer evidence supporting task sequencing principles such as StC sequencing, faciliting deeer procesing and aiding in schema development for L2 writing task performance (Lambert & Robinson, 2014).

# 5.3. Effects of task sequencing on lexical complexity

The significant main effect of Group for MTLD indicates that task sequencing impacts lexical diversity in L2 writing. The StC group exhibited more lexicall diverse vocabulary than the Ct and Random groups, suggesting the StC group's task sequence may have been more efective. Additionally, the CtS group showed higher MLD than the Random group, supporting StC task sequencing's effectiveness These findings underscore task sequencing's role in promoting lexical diversity (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022). Teachers can enhance language larning environments by designing sequences aligning with the ssARC model, prioritizing complexity for acquiring features like lexical diversity (Robinson, 2010). However, the non-significant efect of Stage on MTLD suggests other factors like proficiency, cognitive ailities, or topic familirity may influence lexical dversity. Nonetheles, the findings suport task equencing's importance. A significant main efect of Group and Stage for wRD also indicates task sequencing significantly affects lexical sophis tication in L2 writing. The StC group demonstrated more lexicallysophisticated vocabulary than the CtS and Random groups, sug. gesting StC sequencing's efectivenes. Additionally, the Cts group exhibited more WRD than the Random group, further supporting task sequencing's efectivenes. These findings confirm StC sequencing's superiorit. It allows learners to solidify simpler language features before advancing to complex ones, aiding successul acquisition (Robinson, 2021). Ct sequencing might inroduce complex features prematurely, hindering acquisition (Robinson, 2015). The non-significant Stage efect on WRD suggests other factors influence lexical sophistication. Overall the indings emphasize task sequencing role in promoting lexical sophistication, partcularly the StC approach.

# 5.4. Effects of task sequencing on fluency

Finally, the results revealed that the grouping of participants into StC, Cts, and Random groups and Stage had a significant impact on their writing fluency, as evidenced by the statisicall significant main effect of Group on WPM. Specifically, the StC group accelerated their writing speed and produced more words within the given time compared to the CtS and Random groups. This reult is consistent with the results reported by Allaw and McDonough (2019), who found that enhancing cognitive task complexity over a prolonged period leads to improved writing fluency. The non-significant effect for Stage also suggests that the specific stage of the writing process is not as important for promoting writing fluency as other factors.

# 5.5. Effects of task sequencing on task anxiety

Task sequencing also revealed noteworthy effects on task anxiety. Specifically, data suggest that the StC group generally exper. enced less anxit than both the CtS and the Random group. We also found a statistical difference between the CtS and Random groups in Stage 1. However, no differences were found between the CtS and Random groups at Stages 2 and 3, suggesting that simple to complex sequencing might aid students in developing adequate coping mechanisms for managing the cognitive challenges increased task complexity poses, thereby enabling them to direct more cognitive resources to their writing. Specifically, sequencing tasks ac. cording to the ssARC principles (Robinson, 2010), which focuses on stabilization and automatization of the interlanguage system in the earlier stages, might impact the use of affectie resources as well Low coping abilities in light of challenging tasks have been identified as one of the key appraials that activate anxiety (Smith & Lazaus 193). Leaners relizing their caabilities i accesing and successuly using their interlanguage system in the Simplify and Stabilize stage and consolidating their confidence in these capabilities in the Automatization stage might have contributed to an overall lower anxiety experience. In contrast, neither the CtS nor the Random group was able to systematically build similar coping mechanisms. While the Cts group was also experiencing a consolidation stage (i., atomatization), lers in this group might have ee essable than the t group to gaug their caabilities in light of the diferent demands on their interlanguage system. This inverte sequencing in the Cts group could potentill have led to fluctuations in confidence in coping abilitie, resulting in lower beliefs in their capabilities to successully perform the tasks, which subsequently might have contributed to higher overall levels of anxiety.

While anxiety levels in the StC group were overall lower, we also found that anxiety decreased among all groups acrossall stages, meaning that axiety was highest at the beginning of the semester and graduall and consistentl decreased from stages 1 to 2 to 3 for all groups. This inding sugests that the reettion of the same task enre albeit with dfferent task content, might have had an abating effect on anxiety levels in both the Cts and Random groups as well That is, anxiety aso decreased in those groups over time, which might be related to learners developing more concrete writing schema for decision-making tasks or to their growing familiarity with the task environment over the semester. Both factors are assumed to form a basis against which learners evaluate their (task) performance (Abdi Tabari, Sato, & Wang, 2023). With the increased availability of argumentative writing schema and a growing familiarity with their task environment, learners in both the CtS and Random groups also seem to have been able to decrease the perceived discreancy between the levef aility neded t succed in the ask and the level f ability they poss at the time f ask performance. This decrease in discrepancy can be conceptualized as a growth in learners self-confidence in their abilities over time, albeit at a significantly lower rate than was observed for the StC group.

# 5.6. Effects of task sequencing on task enjoyment

The effects of task sequencing on task enjoyment are slightly more nuanced than the anxiety findings. Overall all three groups graduall increased their enjoyment level from stages 1 to 3, thereby indicating an inversion of the trend we observed for anxiety. In other words, task enjoyment levels were the lowest at the beginning of the semester and the highest at the end of the semester for all groups, regardless of their task sequencing principle. This finding might not be surprising, considering that enjoyment is linked to satisfaction and resuls from the completion or the outcome of a task (Tomkins, 1962). At the beginning of the semester, leaners have no outcome or achievement benchmarks and their uncertainty about their achievement capabilities and task outcome assessment is higher than the joy and pleasure derived from completing the task (Teimouri, 2017). However, as their ability to gauge outcome expectations and achievement capabilities increases, our results suggest that leners' task enjoyment gradually increases as well.

Additionally, our results show that task enjoyment is greatest in the StC group, where task complexity increased systematically following the ssARC principles. Education research indicates that enjoyment is linked to growing confidence and coping abilities in response to challenging activities (Izard, 197). ur data sugests that task sequencing acording to SSAR principle fosters leaners development of coping ailities and self-confidence systematically and effctively, which contributes to lower levels of anxiety and notably higher levels of enjoyment. Aditionally, recent research in SLA has shown that enjoyment is linked to the experience of optimal challenges (Boudreau et al., 2018) and our findings indicate that sequencing tass according to SsARC principles might be a possible solution to presenting learners with increasingly complex task versions that correspond to pleasant and engaging learning experiences that are perceived as rewarding and that might positively affect performance e.g., development of syntactic complexity).

However, while ll groups increased their enjoyment levels from the beginning of the semester (Stage 1) to the end (Stage 3), enjoyment levels in the Random group slightly dropped between Stage 1 and Stage 2, although this decrease was not statistically significant. This finding is noteworthy, because we found no statistical ifferences between the StC group and the Random group at Stage 1, suggesting that enjoyment levels were similar in both groups at the start of the data collection. The Random group may have been experiencing a less optimal challenge for their learning and/or may have been lessable to access writing schemas for each task version at Stage 2 due to the unsystematic task sequencing in this group. Both factors may have impacted learners' coping and confidence levels to a degre that resulted in lower task enjoyment vis-a-vis Stage 1. Altenatively, this group might have not had an interest in the task topic at Stage 2. Educational research has produced strong evidence for the link between interest and enjoyment (Ainley & Hidi, 2014). Therefore, our results suggest that factors other than sequencing principles such as perceived coping abilities, interest, and confidence, might impact the dynamicity of affective IDs, especially enjoyment.

Our findings for group differences in enjoyment after Stage 2 suggest that the former interpretation might be more likely. Enjoyment levels for the StC group continue to significantly increase in comparison to both the CtS and Random group, for which no statistical group differences were found at Stages 2 and 3. In other words, whil CtS and Random groups can increase their enjoyment levels at Stage 3, their levels are significantly lower than those in the StC group. This patten suggests that learners can adjust to any task sequencing and that they derive noticeable pleasure and satisfaction from their perceived peformance. In other words, ejoyment levels can rise over time regardless f the task sequencing principle, but a systematic increase in task complexity in line with sSARC principles more significantly contributes to learners' enjoyment.

# 5.7. Relationships between CALF metrics and writing task emotions

Lastly, we investigated bivariate relationships between CALF indices and task emotions and their changes over time. The results indicated that correlations not only increased in statistical significance but also inthe magnitude of the relationship that was detected over time except for clausal complexity (DC/T), for which no sigificant correlations were found for either task emotion at any point in time. Notably, results only show a smal negative significant link between anxiety, complexity (CN/T), and accuracy (EFCs), as well as a small positive significant link between enjoyment and complexity (CN/T) in Stage 1 (Plonsky & Oswald, 2014). In contrast, our data revealed smal to mid-sized negative correlations for axiety and all CALF dimensions and small to mid-sized positive orrelations for enjoyment and all CALF dimensions in Stage 2. The magnitude of these links ranges from sizable to large for all CALF indices and both task emotions at Stage 3 (Plonsky & Oswald, 2014), while the directions of the respective relationships remain constant. Importantly, the magnitudes of the correlations are almost mirror images of each other at Stages 2 and 3. However, at Stage 2 the magnitude of enjoyment appears to be slightly biger, while the magnitude of anxiety is slightly bigger at Stage 3 except for accuracy (CVFs.

Despite these mirroring trends, previous studies have established that anxiety and enjoyment are related but \*appear to be in. dependent emotions and not opposite ends of the same dimension'" (Dewaele & MacIntyre, 2014, p. 261). However, Dewaele and MacIntyre (2014) also found that enjoyment seemed to be a more stable emotion, as opposed to anxiety which has been found to fluctuate more. Interestingly, our findings do not lend support to their claim. Intead, we found both emotions to dynamically change throughout the semester. This finding might be related to our choice of task emotions rather than foreign language classroom emotions. Our data do not capture participants emotions regarding their writing sills, but rather regarding the task(s). Observing that both affective variables are equally dynamic raises questions regarding the dimensionality of anxiety and enjoyment in task-based contexts. That is, learners may not only experience language-related emotions but also task-related emotions (Kormos et al., 2020), which sugests that both constructs might affect (written) task performance diferentl. Vverall, the trends in the data suggest that gradually incresing task enjoyment and gradually decreasing task anxiety both affect  write productions positively, regardess of the task sequencing principle.

# 6. Conclusion: implications, limitations, and future research directions

Our findings have theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, they support the sARC model linked to the Cognition Hypothesis demonstrating that arranging writing tasks in a simple-to-complex (StC) order and incresing cognitive demands leads to significant improvements in CALF in L2 learners' writing over time. The ssARC model, based on dynamic memory and case-based reasoning theory, suggests humans learn by adapting solutions to similar past problems. These results suggest L2 writers performing tasks in a simple-to-complex order ikely undergo a four-step proces of case-based reasoning, aiding their inerlanguage systems development. The StC group showed CALF development improvements in their L2 writing, ystematicall decreased task anxiety, and increased task enjoyment over nine weeks. This suggests that conditions during task performance enabled them to use prior experiences, and knowledge to avoid repeating problems, identify problematic linguistic areas, and recognize relevant task charateristics, thus improving writing skill. Additionall, these cognitive processes are linked to lower task anxiety and heightened task enjoyment, fostering conducive language learning conditions. Adopting the ssARC model promotes a gradual, consistent learning process where learners retain acquired knowledge and skillsfrom simpler tasks to meet complex tak demands, also scaffolding emotion regulation abilities. Therefore, sequencing writing tasks in a simple-to-complex order helps learners develop the abilit to meet the cognitive and afective demands of real-world writing tass including the diverse challenges individuals face in practical writing scenarios. These challnges involve cognitive aspects, such as tak complexity, and emotional elements tied to the writing process. I adopting the sARC model for task sequencing, our study aimed to foster a gradual and consistent learning process. This method enabled learners to retain knowledge and skill acquired from simpler tas, empowering them to apply these foundations to meet more omplex task demands. Additioall, significant task sequencing effects were found in reducing task anxiety and improving task enjoyment. This suggests sequencing tasks from simple to complex can substantially impact these emotions, specificll at a situated level. While this emphasizes the advantages of a simple-to-complex task sequencing order, we acknowledge the non-linear nature of real-world writing demands. Delving into diverse task sequences becomes crucial in preparing learners for the dynamic and unpredictable nature of real-world writing demands, enhancing thir adaptability and flexibility in addressing various challenges.

Pedagogically, L2 writing practitioners can use the ssARC model to implement practice oportunities consolidating target lexical items and grammatical structures for learners. They can adjust the cognitive demands of tasks and instructional procedures to aid learners in understanding task instructions and requirements, fostering independent writing with or without guidance (Abdi Tabari & Cho, 2022). Continuous scafflded practice should be provided until leaners achieve task mastery. However, pedagogic task sequencing decisions should be based on initial behavioral needs analysis of learners' writing task performance (Robinson, 2010), individual diffrences, and specific needs and preferences in writing contexts. Tasks should align with classroom or curricular ac. tivities, with established criteria to monitor task progression over time. Sequencing tasks with varying cognitive complexity in isolation may not yield significant outcomes for L2 writing development. This study emphasizes task sequencing's crucial role in L2 writing development and offers a practical framework for practitioners to design and sequence writing tas effectively. Considering learners individual differences and specific context, practitioner can provide scaffolded practce and facilitate gradual progression toward independent task mastery.

We acknowledge several limitations that should be addressed in future rsearch. Firstl, the study's ecological validity is limited by focusing on only thre task sequencing groups, neglecting the potential impact of other commonly used task sequences in L2 writing classroms. Secondly, Revesz et al. (2016) advocated for including subjective techniques like self-rating and expert opinions in measuring the cognitive demands of L2 writing development. However, these methods may have limitations. Therefore, enhancing assesment with advanced objectie techniques such as eye-tracking, keystroke-logging, and neuroimaging, as suggested by u et al. (2021), would offer more thorough insight into inherent cognitie demands in L2 writing development. Thirdly, the fluency measure employed in this study relied on a product-based metric (w/M). Subsequent research should incorporate proces-based fluency measures encompassing cognitive processe ike speed, pausing, and eye-gazing behaviors, particularly considering their usceptility to task sequencing effects (Revesz et al., 2022. imilarly, the study exclusively employed task emotion measures, thereby overlooking participants' writing skill-specific emotions. Lastly, the study did not investigate L2 learners cognitive processing whil working on each task sequencing, and future research should explore the relationship between task sequencing and depth of processing in L2 learners (Leow, 2020). Despite these imitations, this study contributes to advancing existing knowledge about interactions between task sequencing and L2 learners' affective factors and provides insight for future research in L2 writing development.
