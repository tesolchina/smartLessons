# BALEAP news â€“ Introduction to SIGs: Meet TEd in EAP SIG

The Teacher Education in EAP (TEd in EAP) SIG specialises in the area of teacher education for the EAP profession, specifically the education and professional development of EAP practitioners. These areas include but are not limited to: approaches to development in different EAP contexts; EAP practitioner education and credentials; an exploration of the EAP practitioner knowledge base and implications for development and education; and the role scholarship plays. The SIG is aimed at two constituent groups, those delivering, designing and supporting Continuing Professional Development (CPD)/teacher education for teachers of EAP, and individuals interested in developing their own practice.

The main aims of this SIG are:

$\bullet$ to create a community and space to explore, problematise and innovate approaches to EAP practitioner development (institutional and self-directed)   
$\bullet$ to establish and make visible the needs of EAP practitioners in a variety of contexts   
$\bullet$ to curate and disseminate, and longer term create resources for EAP teacher education

Since launching in 2021, we have built a forum for EAP teacher educators and individuals to support and nurture dialogue on matters of professional development. We have 162 registered members within our SIG and an active community on YouTube and Twitter. We are an international group with at least 10 different countries represented amongst our membership (and many more amongst non-members).

To date, we have run 12 online events, some of which have explored aspects of teacher education whilst others have concentrated on approaches to individual practitioner development. These have included Reading Circles, TEAP Chatters, workshops, as well as talks at conferences and presentations from guest speakers who are experts in their fields. Speakers included Olwyn Alexander (teacher observations), Judith Hanks (exploratory practice), Jeni Driscoll (in sessional courses), Paul Hendrie, the BALEAP TEAP Officer (the revised BALEAP Individual Accreditation TEAP scheme), and Angela Hakim (CPD in low resource contexts) amongst others. These events are well attended attracting up to 138 participants. Feedback has shown high satisfaction rates, with most attendants appre ciating the opportunity to network, meet up with colleagues, talk about their jobs, problematise together and seek advice about their professional development.

In 2022, we ventured beyond Zoom and participated in-person at the BALEAP $5 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ Anniversary event in Manchester, networking with BALEAP members and sharing information about our SIG and its aims. In September 2022, to focus on expanding our global membership we participated in the $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ Int'l EAP Conference in Crete, Greece and met EAP practitioners working in various EAP contexts both in the UK and Europe. This allowed attendees to meet members of our SIG Committee, Stella Bunnag and Angeliki Apostolidou, to find out how they can benefit from what we offer, which includes: attending our workshops to learn and network; becoming members and joining our jisc-mail (TedEAP@baleap.org TedEAP@baleap.org); accessing information and resources on our website (https://tedeap.wordpress.com/); following our Twitter feeds (https://twitter.com/TEd_EAP/) and subscribing to our You Tube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@tedineap9442), where we house recordings of all our events.

Looking ahead, we have more plans. Future directions include facilitating joint research in the field of EAP; further supporting individual and institutional CPD by offering more events including moderated discussions and creating more resources for individual practitioners and for teacher educators designing and delivering professional development within the EAP community. We look forward to welcoming more members who can join on our website. If you are interested in leading an event or giving a talk for the SIG, you can submit a proposal (https://tedeap.wordpress.com/contact/).

Some of the comments below attest to the contributions of our SIG since its constitution:

This workshop has given me insights into my own teaching practice   
The workshop provided a really interesting platform to share and explore ideas   
Useful info and guidance   
Really interesting talk-good balance between information about the wider research and implications for the professional practice   
The presentation was very informative and inspiring for me and prompted me to further reflect on my own approach to scholarship   
Very insightful and interesting. Thought provoking. I liked that we got to chat to other staff from other universities in the breakout rooms to   
gain tips/share experience. A truly informative session that brought home a number of interesting perspectives   
The event exceeded my expectations   
I really enjoyed the session. There was a good balance of information and opportunities to meet others   
Good to network with others, thank you
