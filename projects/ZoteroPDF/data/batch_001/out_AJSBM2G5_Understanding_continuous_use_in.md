# ABSTRACT

This paper presents a new model of integrated technology continuance model (ITCM) to explain teachers’ Continuous Use Intention (CUI) of technology in the higher education institutions (HEIs). Drawing constructs from prominent technology adoption models like TAM, UTAUT, and incorporating the theory of TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge), the new research model is developed and tested. An online survey was carried out to gather data from 573 teachers teaching in the HEIs of an emerging economy using purposive sampling method. Data collected was evaluated utilizing the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Analysis establishes applicability of ITCM model in predicting CUI of technology among teachers, with an explanatory power of $6 0 . 4 \%$ . The study also highlights the positive influence of facilitating conditions and management support on TPACK which has a favorable impact on selfefficacy, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Additionally, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, self-efficacy, and social influence has a major influence on the CUI of technology among teachers in HEIs. The study provides insights into factors influencing the integration of technological innovations in a teachers’ pedagogy and the classroom settings to achieve some key tasks of sustainable development goal 4 (SDG4). Future research directions and study implications have been proposed considering the research findings.

# 1. Introduction

Higher education institutions (HEIs) worldwide are using technology more and more because of its enormous benefits for teaching and learning (Koehler and Mishra 2009; Teo 2011; Okoye et al. 2022). This growth is reflective in the corresponding increase in global e-learning market size which is forecasted to reach almost 400 billion US dollars by 2026 (Statista.com 2022). To reimagine education in the modern world, it is essential to integrate and implement educational technology into pedagogy and scale digital learning solutions and innovations. Doing so aligns with and helps achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4), which calls for universal access to high-quality, inclusive, and egalitarian education as well as opportunities for lifelong learning (unicef.org 2021; Maketo et al. 2023).

Implementing educational technology and scaling digital learning innovations will be key to providing the access, quality, and equity in education envisioned by SDG4. A growing body of scholarly literature has documented the numerous advantages conferred by the integration of educational technology. This includes enhanced communication between teachers and learners (Liu 2008), increased classroom participation and engagement (Sharma and Saini 2022), democratized access to education through MOOCs (Meet, Kala, and Al-Adwan 2022), and improved academic achievement outcomes among students (Simms and Paschke-Wood 2022). The successful integration of technology into pedagogical practices hinges fundamentally on the teacher (Pelgrum 2001; Teo 2011). This is because the affordances of educational technologies cannot be fully realized if educators do not implement these tools in intended pedagogically sound ways (Teo 2011). To this effect, various research on the adoption of technology has been carried out over a period among teachers and students to understand factors influencing technology adoption (Al-Maroof, Alhumaid, and Salloum ${ } ^ { 2 0 2 0 ; }$ Meet and Kala 2021; Du, Liang, and Liu 2022). While the integration of technology in higher education has proliferated, limited research has explicated the factors driving sustained utilization among university teachers (Juan and Gairín 2020). Understanding these motivations is vital, especially in the context of the ongoing digital revolution. This revolution has sparked continuous advancements in information and communication technologies (ICTs), exponential growth in information, the utilization of various digital resources and media, and unprecedented levels of technological adoption (Basilotta-Gómez-Pablos et al. 2022). As this revolution transforms pedagogical paradigms, further inquiry is needed to understand what compels faculty to persistently integrate emerging technologies within their higher education teaching practices. Additionally, while a growing body of literature has examined technology integration in education, the predominant focus has been on student outcomes and experiences (Meet and Kala 2021). Less attention has been paid to educators’ perspectives, particularly within higher education contexts. As Bøe, Sandvik, and Gulbrandsen (2020) note, teachers utilize technology not only for instruction but also to enhance their own productivity and accomplish assigned work. The intention to use is characterized as ‘a measure of the strength of one’s intention to perform a specified behavior’ (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989), Bhattacherjee (2001). Information system (IS) continuance use intention is described as ‘an individual’s intention to continue using an information system, in contrast to initial use or acceptance’. Continuance intention focuses on the user’s intention to sustain their usage of a technology beyond the initial adoption phase, while initiation to use concerns the factors influencing the initial decision to adopt and start using the technology. However, as Sharma and Saini (2022) suggest, further research is needed to understand university teachers’ continuous use intentions (CUI) regarding educational technologies. This represents a critical gap, as teacher acceptance and sustained usage are essential preconditions for achieving the intended benefits of technology integration. By building on calls for further inquiry (Sharma and Saini 2022), the present study will address this need through an examination of the factors influencing university teachers’ continuous use intentions of educational technologies. Filling this research gap will provide valuable insights to guide policies and strategies that promote persistent, effective technology integration among higher education faculty. Thus, the goal of this research is to comprehend combined effect of integrated technology adoption models along-with TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) to explore a more thorough and educationspecific analysis of the proposed predictors on teachers’ CUI of technology in HEIs to develop an Integrated Technology Continuance Model (ITCM). TPACK explains the knowledge teachers need for effective technology integration in teaching (Santos and Castro 2021). It recognizes knowledge a teacher needs for technological integration in their pedagogy and in carrying out other complex and multifaceted roles and responsibilities. TPACK is the foundation for teachers to use technology for effective pedagogy (Zhang 2021). The predictors in the proposed integrated model are culled from Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and TPACK.

This study offers several contributions. Firstly, the conceptual model underpinning this study offers a new perspective by synthesizing TAM, UTAUT and TPACK to identify the key drivers of CUI among teachers. Secondly, there’s limited research suggestive of integration of these theoretical models to put forward a holistic perspective and understanding of antecedents of teachers’ ongoing use of technology in HEIs of Jordan, an emerging economy, revealing unique contextual insights. Thirdly, the inclusion of TPACK is an innovative feature, as few technology acceptance studies have incorporated this context-specific construct. As we progress, it is crucial to review the detailed literature on the matter of technology acceptance theories and its influence on CUI of technology. Section two of the article is dedicated to literature review followed by hypothesis development in section three. Research methodology is described in the fourth section, followed by analyzes and findings in section five. Discussion and implications are covered in section six, followed by conclusion and future scope of work in section seven.

# 2. Literature review

Among the widely accepted theories in technology acceptance are the TAM (Davis 1989), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen 1991), and the UTAUT (Venkatesh et al. 2003). UTAUT and TAM were found commonly employed in the literature among these theories, mostly to explain teachers’ behavioral intention to use technology (Granić and Marangunić 2019; Williams, Rana, and Dwivedi 2015; Tamilmani et al. 2021). Prior researchers, particularly in the field of education, have attempted to create a model by extending, or using the TAM, TPACK, or UTUAT model or its constructs (Cao et al., 2022; Meet, Kala, and Al-Adwan 2022; Tamilmani et al. 2021). TAM proposed by Davis (1989) postulated that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) decide a person’s intention to use technology, which in return impacts use behavior. TAM has been applied extensively in educational contexts to understand teachers’ adoption of technologies. While TAM provides highlevel understanding of users’ technology adoption, it has limitations (Al-Adwan et al. 2023). The TAM model focuses narrowly on PU and PEU, lacking contextual factors that influence adoption (Zhang et al. 2022). Additionally, it emphasizes technical dimensions over psychological and social ones, thus adoption models are needed to account for the range of contextual and human factors that drive technology acceptance. This study incorporated TAM’s PU and PEU as key determinants of teachers’ continuous use intention besides the constructs of facilitating condition (FC) and social influence (SI) taken from the theory of UTAUT propounded by Venkatesh et al. (2003). UTAUT which associates performance expectancy, effort expectancy, SI, and FC as core constructs influencing technology acceptance and use. The UTAUT has been extensively employed by researchers to elucidate the acceptance of various technological innovations, particularly within educational contexts (Al-Adwan and Al-Debei 2023). For instance, UTAUT has been applied in investigating the acceptance of e-learning (Al-Adwan et al. 2021), the integration of ICTs in higher education (Rosaline and Wesley 2017), the adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) among higher education students (Meet, Kala, and Al-Adwan 2022), higher education students’ acceptance of E-books (Lawson-Body et al. 2020), and the implementation of an early warning system (Raffaghelli et al. 2022). However, individuals’ personal characteristics are not considered in UTAUT (Khechine and Augier 2019) and to offset this, another predictor variable of teacher self-efficacy (SEE) is included in ITCM model as an individual characteristic and the interaction of TPACK with SEE, PU, PEU and their further influence on CUI has been studied for the first time to the best of authors knowledge and can be regarded as a novel contribution to the knowledge pool. The theory of TPACK which arises from the multiple interactive integration of three kinds of knowledge was propounded by Mishra and Koehler (2006). This theory lays emphasis on the significance of intersection between technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge for effective use of technology in pedagogy and is a necessary knowledge framework for teachers. It served as a complementary perspective to understand the role of teachers’ skillsets and knowledge in shaping continuous use intentions (Zhang 2021). TPACK has been studied by the researchers in multiple settings such as understanding the teachers’ intention to use technology (Wangdi, Dhendup, and Gyelmo 2023), teachers’ intention towards online teaching post COVID-19 (Khong et al. 2023), use of digital technologies by teachers (Sharma and Saini 2022), teachers’ continuous learning of TPACK (Zhou et al. 2022), and influence of TPACK on preservice teachers’ acceptance of virtual reality (Thohir et al. 2023). Though TAM, UTAUT, and TPACK have been employed independent of each other in research on technology acceptance and use (Granić and Marangunić 2019; Tamilmani et al. 2021), the integration of contextual constructs of these theories to understand and explain the CUI and in providing varying perspective on technology use among higher education teachers represents a novel contribution (Grant and Osanloo 2014; Wangdi, Dhendup, and Gyelmo 2023), especially in context of an emerging economy of Jordan. Thus, an integrated and cohesive model of ITCM has been developed based on three theories namely, TAM, UTAUT, and TPACK. The constructs of FC and SI are taken from UTAUT theory, in addition to the independent constructs of Management Support (MAG), SEE and TPACK to study their influence on the two variables of TAM namely PU and PEU towards the CUI of technology. By leveraging multiple theoretical lenses by forming an ITCM model, the study endeavors to advance understanding of the factors shaping teachers’ ongoing technology use to inform policy and practice in emerging economy’s HEIs. Each variable and hypothesis are explained and listed in the ensuing section.

# 3. Hypothesis development

# 3.1. Facilitated condition and TPACK

FC refers to ‘conviction about the ability of existing fabric and environment in an organization to promote the adoption of specific systems’. It can also be thought of as the fundamental environmental factor that facilitates the completion of a task (Teo and Noyes 2012). The primary obstacles to employing digital technologies in teaching and learning include a lack of training, inadequate infrastructure and resources, and limited access to the internet and digital platforms (Okoye et al. 2022). The available literature alludes to the influence of FC on TPACK in the context of preservice teachers’ acceptance of virtual reality (Thohir et al. 2023) and on CUI in the adoption of digital technologies (Sharma and Saini 2022). Thus, we posit that:

H1: Facilitating conditions have a statistically significant effect on TPACK.

# 3.2. Management support relationship with TPACK

MAG refers to top management’s favorable attitude towards technology use and support with a thought that employees should use it for routine work (Šumak et al. 2017; Anđić et al. 2022). Professional barriers are the most common one’s teachers perceive when trying to use digital technologies in HEIs (Juan and Gairín 2020). This highlights the need for better professional development for teachers as well as increased institutional involvement through strategic plans. In this research, MAG represent the teachers’ impression of how college administrators, decision-makers, and owners support the use of technology by motivating educators, equipping them with the latest technological tools and training they need, and ensuring they have access to the necessary subject-matter experts. Based on the literature, we posit that:

H2: Management support has a statistically significant effect on TPACK.

# 3.3. TPACK relationship with PU, PEU, and SE

Mishra and Koehler (2006) developed the theory of TPACK to aid teachers make technology an integral part of their pedagogy. Main elements of this theory are Technological Knowledge (TK),

Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), and Content Knowledge (CK). TPACK places a strong emphasis on how knowledge and technology are dynamically interconnected (Schmidt et al. 2009). According to research, teachers’ SEE, PEU, PU of technology, and intention to utilize technology are all positively correlated with TPACK (Abbitt 2011; Njiku 2022). When applying TPACK in multiple contexts, such as early childhood education, math education, physical education, and college education, preservice teachers showed a high degree of teacher SEE (Abbitt 2011). Furthermore, PEU and PU were strongly and favorably impacted by TPACK (Thohir et al. 2023). TPACK teachers were found to be more selfassured in their ability to choose and apply appropriate technological innovations in the pedagogy (Joo, Park, and Lim 2018; Maeng et al. 2013). Thus, we posit that:

H3. TPACK has a statistically significant effect on self-efficacy.   
H4. TPACK has a statistically significant effect on perceived usefulness.   
H5. TPACK has a statistically significant effect on perceived ease of use.

# 3.4. Self-efficacy relationship with PU

SEE is seen as an inherent motivation in terms of CUI. It refers to how much trust users have in using technology (Cai et al. 2018; Al-Maroof, Alhumaid, and Salloum 2020). SEE has been found to be positively affecting PU e.g. in context of live streaming commerce environment (Cao et al. 2022), and learning management system (Usman et al. 2020). Thus, we posit that:

H6: Self-efficacy has a statistically significant effect on perceived usefulness.

# 3.5. Perceived ease of use relationship with perceived usefulness

PEU is described as an ‘extent to which an individual believes that using a particular system would be free from exerting self, much’ (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989). PEU is one of the important technological components that could significantly affect how people continue to use technology (Collis and Moonen 2002). PEU positively affects PU (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989; Wijnen, Walma Van Der Molen, and Voogt 2021) which was corroborated by Fink, Spoden, and Frey (2022) in his study on e-exams. With this theoretical background, we posit that:

H7: Perceived ease of use has a statistically significant effect on perceived usefulness.

# 3.6. Self-efficacy relationship with CUI

SEE as defined in section 3.4, suggests that some people think using technology is quite simple and doable, while others may hold a contrary opinion because they may find it difficult to understand how to use technology properly (Al-Maroof, Alhumaid, and Salloum 2020). Simply put, this implies that those with a high degree of technological self-belief will be able to accurately understand the system and keep using it for good (Al-Maroof, Alhumaid, and Salloum 2020). A study by Sharma and Saini (2022) of online gamers supported this idea. With this theoretical background, we posit that:

H8: Self-efficacy has a statistically significant effect Om continuous use intention.

# 3.7. Perceived usefulness relationship with continuous use intention

PU is described as an ‘extent to which an individual believes that using a particular system would improve his or her productivity and performance at job’ (Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989). Previous research has affirmed that PU has a major impact on CUI (Bøe, Sandvik, and Gulbrandsen

2020; Wijnen, Walma Van Der Molen, and Voogt 2021). PU has been found to influence the CUI. In the case of web portal services (Chen, Lai, and Ho 2015), and e-learning (Limayem and Cheung 2008). However, a study by Sharma and Saini (2022) revealed that PU doesn’t have any significant impact on CUI of digital technologies. Considering these confirmations and contradictions in the extant literature, we posit that:

H9: Perceived usefulness has a statistically significant effect on continuous use intention.

# 3.8. Perceived ease of use (PEU) relationship with CUI

PEU as described in Section 3.7, is one of the major technological components that significantly influences how people continue to use technology (Collis and Moonen 2002). According to studies (AlEmran, Arpacı, and Salloum 2020; Sharma and Saini 2022), PEU is a key predictor of how long individuals would continue to use digital technologies, m-learning platforms, and digital teaching/learning settings. With this theoretical background, we posit that:

H10: Perceived ease of use has a statistically significant effect on continuous use intention.

# 3.9. Social influence relationship with perceived usefulness

SI is a degree to which people consider other people’s thoughts and opinions about the appropriateness of using a certain technology to be significant (Venkatesh et al. 2003; Meet, Kala, and Al-Adwan 2022; Anđić et al. 2022). A study by Haverila, McLaughlin, and Haverila (2022) revealed that SI significantly influences PU in the usage of non-pharmaceutical interventions amongst people of Canada. In context of our research, SI can be attributed to several groups including students, co-workers, parents, college administration, educational policy makers, and others who may have various expectations from teachers on their use of technology. Thus, we posit that:

H11: Social influence has a statistically significant effect on perceived usefulness.

# 3.10. Social influence relationship with CUI

SI as described in Section 3.9, has a direct positive influence on continuing usage intentions (AlAdwan et al. 2021). In this research, SI is explained as teachers’ expectations of how their students, co-workers, parents, college administration, educational policy makers, and others would respond to their use of technology in the classroom. Thus, we posit that:

H12: Social influence has a statistically significant effect on continuous use intention.

# 3.11. Continuous use intention

CUI is explained as ‘opinions and suggestions from users about the continuous use of technological innovations or an updated technology’ (Khlaif, Sanmugam, and Ayyoub 2022; Gupta, Yousaf, and Mishra 2020). CUI differs from pre-adoption since continuance is a crucial factor in determining how users will act towards a certain technology based on their cumulative experience using it (Gupta, Yousaf, and Mishra 2020). Users’ attitudes about new information and communication technologies can be inferred from their regular usage of one technology (Kim et al. 2014). Users’ CUI when using new technology has a big impact on their behavior (Gupta, Yousaf, and Mishra 2020) and a teachers’ CUI is indicative of prolonged integration of technology in pedagogy.

Basis literature reviewed, the suggested model showing relationships between each variable is shown below (Figure 1).

# 4. Research methodology

This study investigates CUI of technology by the teachers of HEIs in Jordan using a quantitative approach. The data was collected from the teachers of HEIs in Jordan who currently utilize technology in their teaching by employing an online survey questionnaire using purposive sampling method. These specific respondents were chosen because they were in a more favorable position to accomplish this study’s objective. Accordingly, a screening question was placed at the beginning of the questionnaire to assess the eligibility of respondents based on predefined criteria. Data collection commenced in April 2023 and concluded in July 2023. The questionnaire items were adapted from validated instruments used in prior related research on technology acceptance and use in education (see Appendix A). The survey instrument designed for this research contained two distinct sections. The opening section gathered respondent background characteristics like age, gender, and years of experience (see Table 1). The subsequent section included multiple items tailored to quantify the key perceptual variables contained within the conceptual model of ITCM. All perception-based items utilized a 5-point ordinal scale for answers, ranging from complete disagreement to complete agreement. According to Buttle (1996), utilizing a 5-point Likert scale can increase response rates and improve response quality compared to scales with more points. Specifically, Babakus and Mangold (1992) found that 5-point scales reduced respondent frustration relative to 7-point scales. The reduced cognitive load and simplicity of fewer scale points encourages survey participation and enables respondents to make quicker, more thoughtful selections of their true attitudes and perceptions. This results in higher quality data that more accurately captures the intended constructs, outweighing the potential gains in nuance from additional scale points. Using this structured questionnaire, the study was designed to quantify teachers’ perceptions of the technology continuous use intentions and test the hypothesized relationships between the proposed variables. A panel of three academics with experience in higher education technologies evaluated the questionnaire’s content validity. These professors have over a decade of extensive expertise in higher education technologies. Specifically, they have researched, developed, and published extensively on educational technologies at the university level. Furthermore, they have led university teaching and learning centers, overseeing technology integration across disciplines. Minor corrections were made based on their feedback. The questionnaire was then pilot tested with 43 higher education teachers to evaluate readability and appropriateness. No major concerns were reported. The final questionnaire was provided in both Arabic and English, with back-translation used to ensure equivalence.

A total of 573 complete responses were obtained from the teachers at public and private universities in Jordan. PLS-SEM was selected as the most appropriate statistical approach for testing the hypothesized model in this study where the goal of research is finding the main target constructs and recognizing the main driver constructs (Hair et al. 2019). The complex relationships hypothesized between the perceptual constructs in the research model can be effectively modeled and tested using PLS-SEM. Furthermore, the main reasons for employing PLS-SEM involve non-normal data and restricted sample sizes (Hair et al. 2019). For evaluating the normality of our multivariate data, the Mardia’s multivariate normality test was performed. The result indicates that multivariate kurtosis (173.18) and skewness (22.11) and exceeded the recommended cut-off point. Consequently, these results affirm the presence of non-normal multivariate data, rendering PLS-SEM as the ideal selection for data analysis. To mitigate Common Method Bias (CMB), the clear design and questions were used to get honest responses. Statistically, Harman’s single-factor test was employed to analyze all measurement items through exploratory factor analysis (Podsakoff et al. 2003). The results revealed that all measurement items were grouped into eight factors. The first factor accounted for only $4 6 . 3 \%$ of variance, below the $5 0 \%$ CMB cutoff. Hence, there was no problem with CMB in this study.

# 5.1. Data analysis and findings

Data collected was analyzed using PLS-SEM in SmartPLS 3.0. The analysis was conducted in two phases – measurement model and structural model.

# 5.1.1. Measurement model

The reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the model’s constructs were assessed by evaluating the measurement model. Composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) were used to measure construct reliability. All constructs fulfilled the recommended thresholds of $\mathrm { C R } > 0 . 7$ and AVE $> 0 . 5$ (see Table 2), indicating adequate internal consistency and convergent validity (Hair et al. 2019). All indicators loaded significantly on associated constructs than on other constructs. Furthermore, factor loading of each item is greater than 0.708 except for TPACK7 which had a loading factor of 0.614, implying all the items possessing acceptable item reliability.

Discriminant validity was measured by comparing the square root of the AVE values with interconstruct correlations (Fornell and Larcker 1981). The $\sqrt { A V E s }$ (in bold) were greater than the inter-construct correlations (below the main diagonal), suggesting presence of discriminant validity (see Table 3). In addition, the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio was assessed as a criterion to establish discriminant validity. As shown in Table 3, all HTMT values (above the main diagonal) were below the threshold of 0.85 (Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2014), giving further proof of discriminant validity. Overall, the measurement model results demonstrated that the scales used in this research were reliable and valid.

# 5.1.2. Structural model

The structural model was determined after measurement model. Using bootstrapping method with 5000 resamples, the path coefficients’ significance was ascertained (Hair et al. 2019). As shown in Table 4, all hypothesized relationships were supported. Specifically, MAG $\mathrm { \Delta } \cdot \mathrm { \{ }  8 = 0 . 3 4 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ) and FC $\beta = 0 . 3 5 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ) had a positive effect on TPACK. Further, TPACK positively influenced SEE $( \beta = 0 . 5 0 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ), PU $( \beta = 0 . 1 4 2 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , and PEU ( $\beta = 0 . 5 2 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ). Additionally, continuous use intention positively influenced by SEE $( \beta = 0 . 2 4 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ), SI $( \beta = 0 . 2 7 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ), PU $( \beta =$ 0.236, $p < . 0 0 1 $ ), and PEU $( \beta = 0 . 1 6 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ).

As demonstrated in Table 5, there was no evidence of multi-collinearity concerns since ‘variance inflation factor’ (VIF) value for all dependent variables was ${ < } 3$ . Furthermore, the effect size $( f )$ of all dependent variable ranged from medium to large.

The coefficient of determination $( { \mathsf { R } } ^ { 2 } )$ was used to evaluate the structural model’s ability to predict outcomes. $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ values were 0.376 for TPACK, 0.633 for PU, 0.273 for PEU, and 0.604 for continuous use intention, indicating that the model explains $3 7 . 6 \% , 6 3 . 3 \% , 2 7 . 3 \% ,$ and $6 0 . 4 \%$ of the variance in these endogenous constructs respectively (see Table 6). The $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ values of 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25 can be regarded as substantial, moderate and weak respectively (Hair et al. 2019). Thus, the model had moderate explanatory power for endogenous constructs. Finally, all of the dependent variables exhibited predictive relevance values $( \mathsf { Q } ^ { 2 } )$ significantly exceeding zero, thereby indicating that the research model possesses a sufficient degree of predictive validity.

The findings suggest that the examined total effects were statistically significant, supporting the efficacy of proposed relationships outlined in the research model (see Table 7). Among the notable outcomes, it is observed that a substantial positive relationship between TPACK and CUI. Specifically, the total effect of TPACK on CUI was found to be highly significant, suggesting that improving teachers’ TPACK directly contributes to increased CUI. Overall, these findings emphasize the essential role of TPACK in promoting technology integration in educational settings, ultimately leading to enhanced teaching practices and student learning experiences and outcomes.

Furthermore, in examining the intricate interplay between TPACK and CUI, Table 8 reveals compelling findings concerning the indirect effects of TPACK via the mediating factors. Specifically, each indirect pathway involving TPACK displays statistically significant associations, highlighting the essential role of TPACK in influencing teachers’ CUI. These results indicate that TPACK exerts considerable influence over mediators, ultimately culminating in heightened levels of CUI. Therefore, the significance of these indirect effects further accentuates the necessity of nurturing teachers’ proficiencies in seamlessly blending technological skills with pedagogical approaches and subject material mastery, consequently promoting greater acceptance and utilization of digital tools in educational environments.

# 6. Discussion and implications

The study reveals the influence of FC in supporting the development of TPACK among higher education teachers. The impact of FC on TPACK is found to be significant, indicating that H1 is accepted. This aligns with previous research demonstrating that FC is a key determinant of successful technology integration in educational settings (Meet, Kala, and Al-Adwan 2022; Al-Adwan et al. 2021; An et al. 2022; Thohir et al. 2023). This implies that teachers who had access to more robust facilitating conditions, such as sufficient technology resources, administrative support, training opportunities, and time for learning, showed greater gains in TPACK after the professional development program. Therefore, higher education leaders aiming to foster teacher TPACK must carefully assess and establish appropriate FC. The results reveal the vital role of MAG in developing higher education teachers’ TPACK and the significant and positive impact it has on TPACK, supporting H2 which aligns with previous research (Bao 2020; Maipita et al. 2023). This alludes to teachers who have received stronger support from academic managers and administrators, in the form of encouragement, resources, and clear expectations, demonstrated greater growth in TPACK competency after the training program.

The results revealed that TPACK of higher education teachers positively influence their SEE and impression of usefulness and ease of use, related to continuous use of technology, supporting H3, H4, and H5, which aligns with the previous research (Abbitt 2011; Joo, Park, and Lim 2018; Yang et al. 2019; Thohir et al. 2023). Teachers who completed TPACK training reported increased beliefs that technology tools can enhance student learning and engagement. They also indicated a higher perceived ability to implement technologies easily and effectively. Additionally, teachers showed significant improvements in confidence for integrating technology into their teaching after building TPACK competency. These findings substantiate previous literature demonstrating the benefits of TPACK-focused professional development for teachers (Scherer et al. 2021).

The findings from this study provide evidence that higher education teacher SEE positively influences both usefulness perceptions of technology and intentions for continuous technology use. These findings indicate that H6 and H8 are supported which is in line with extant literature (Arunachalam 2019; Sharma and Saini 2022). This implies that teachers with high technology self-efficacy perceive greater value in using these tools and are more driven to work through difficulties that arise in the integration process. They also expressed stronger intentions to persist in integrating technologies into their future teaching practices. Hence, developing teacher self-efficacy is therefore critical for fostering positive views of technology usefulness and sustained adoption.

The findings suggest that SI has a positive influence on higher education teachers’ perceptions of usefulness regarding educational technologies, as well as their CUI of technology. This implies that H11 and H12 are supported which aligns with extant literature (Haverila, McLaughlin, and Haverila 2022; Wu and Chen 2017; Al-Maroof, Alhumaid, and Salloum 2020; Al-Adwan et al. 2021). Teachers who experienced greater SI, in the form of encouragement, modeling, and support from peers and managers, were more likely to view technology integration as useful for enhancing student-learning outcomes confirming prior studies (Scherer et al. 2021) and driving sustained usage intentions (Ngai, Poon, and Chan 2007). Additionally, when teachers observe peers successfully using technology or receive assistance and guidance, they gain vicarious experience and social persuasion that contributes to more favorable judgments about tool usefulness.

The findings provide evidence that HEIs teachers’ perceptions of PU and PEU have significant influence on teachers’ intentions to continue using educational technologies over time. Hence, it is concluded that H9 and H10 are supported which is consistent with previous studies (Wu and Chen 2017; Arunachalam 2019; Al-Maroof, Alhumaid, and Salloum 2020; Bøe, Sandvik, and Gulbrandsen 2020). Teachers viewing the technological tools as more useful for enhancing student learning outcomes and easier to implement also showed greater CUI. Furthermore, findings suggest the importance of PEU in shaping teachers’ PU of educational technologies. PEU positively influences teachers’ perceptions of usefulness, indicating that H7 is accepted. This finding aligns with previous studies by Wu and Chen (2017) and Tran, Nguyen, and Tang (2023), which demonstrate that teachers are more inclined to view technology as beneficial for their instructional activities and intend to use it in the future if they find it user-friendly.

# 6.1. Research implications

# 6.1.1. Theoretical implications

This study offers three contributions to the knowledge pool. Firstly, the ITCM model offers a new theoretical perspective by synthesizing three prominent theories on technology acceptance viz. TAM, UTAUT and TPACK to identify the key drivers of CUI among teachers. The rationale of combining these theories was to test their combined effects in a holistic manner and to see the improvement in predictive power of this model to explain higher education teachers’ continuous technology use intention. While previous research has focused on actual system use and use intentions, there has been limited investigation into continuous use intentions especially among the teachers teaching in the HEIs. The integrated model in this study effectively accounted for $6 0 . 4 \%$ of the variance in continuous use intention. This achievement surpasses the results of prior studies, such as those conducted by Chen, Lai, and Ho (2015) and Du, Liang, and Liu (2022), which explain less than $50 \%$ of the variance in teacher usage intentions. In practical terms, this implies that to attain a $6 0 . 4 \%$ sustained usage of technology by teachers in higher education, institutions need to concentrate their efforts and strategies on the predictive factors outlined in the research model. Therefore, ITCM model represents a theoretical advancement on account of its stronger predictive power in explaining teachers’ sustained technology use compared to existing models, however, further testing of the model is mandated to establish it as a well-tested theoretical model in diverse settings. Secondly, there’s limited research suggestive of integration of these theoretical models to put forward a holistic perspective and understanding of antecedents of teachers’ ongoing use of technology in HEIs of an emerging economy, revealing unique contextual insights. Thirdly, the inclusion of TPACK is an innovative feature, as few technology acceptance studies have incorporated this context-specific construct.

# 6.1.2. Practical implications

The findings suggest a multifaceted approach is needed to encourage sustained technology use by higher education teachers. Strategies should aim to increase perceived ease of use via simplified interfaces, tutorials, and tech support. Demonstrating usefulness through examples of enriched teaching and learning is also key. Professional development and communities of practice can build self-efficacy and integration skills. Fostering a collaborative climate with mentoring, sharing, and active encouragement can provide positive social influence. A combination of training, communities, leadership, and success stories may optimize sustained use. Furthermore, continuously assessing teacher needs and evaluating program impacts can allow refinement of technology implementation initiatives. Though focused on higher education, these principles may apply more broadly. Hence, addressing multiple influencing factors can profoundly transform integration practices to enhance instruction and student outcomes. However, a supportive environment paired with teacher skill building is required. A multifaceted approach provides the most promising path for persistent, effective classroom technology use.

Moreover, institutions must take a holistic approach to optimize facilitating conditions and management support to achieve systemic, lasting TPACK and integration improvements among higher education teachers. Assessing technology resources, infrastructure, training, IT support, and release time can reveal gaps. Leadership should communicate goals, provide material support like tool access and incentives. Manager training and adequate support staff are key. Regular assessments of support initiatives should inform continuous improvements. Though specific to higher education, these principles are likely to apply broadly when training staff in technology. Robust facilitating conditions and management support complement TPACK training, empowering effective technologybased education integration.

Importantly, developing educators’ TPACK should be a priority to foster positive teacher perceptions, integration practices, and student outcomes. Comprehensive TPACK training beyond just technical skills can nurture positive views of usefulness, ease of use, and self-efficacy. Hands-on application and ongoing communities of practice are key. Tech support teams optimize ease of use when implementing new skills. Leadership should communicate expectations, provide resources/incentives for TPACK, and consider multi-modal training designs to increase access. Overall, holistic TPACK development can profoundly transform technology integration when paired with institutional support. Evaluating baseline TPACK and ongoing progress can demonstrate value and tailor training. While focused on higher education, TPACK principles have broader relevance. TPACK is critical for effective technology-based education integration and student success. Institutions must prioritize comprehensive, contextualized TPACK development through training, communities, leadership, and tech support. This multifaceted approach can yield transformative outcomes by empowering educators’ pedagogically enriching technology use.

# 7. Conclusion

The research proposed an integrated technology model ITCM based on TAM, UTAUT, and TPACK to investigate HEI teachers’ CUI of technology. The findings revealed that PEU, PU, SEE, and SI were key predictors of continuous use intention. While TPACK was influenced by FC and MAG, which exerted significant influence on PEU, PU, and SEE. The integrated model provides a more comprehensive understanding of factors influencing technology acceptance and use by incorporating factors from established technology acceptance models as well as the context-specific construct of TPACK. The findings suggest that administrators and policymakers should focus their efforts on improving FC, MAG, and TPACK development to promote CUI of educational technologies by teachers which will also help achieve the United Nation’s SDG4, ‘which calls for universal access to high-quality, inclusive, and egalitarian education as well as opportunities for lifelong learning’ and has one of the key tasks to scale digital learning solutions and technological innovations to reimagine education, globally.

# 7.1. Limitations and future research directions

There are some limitations to this study that restrict the generalizability of the findings. First, the survey questionnaire was administered online, and data collected from the teachers of Jordan, alone. Further research could test the proposed model in other cultural and organizational contexts. Second, the cross-sectional survey design limits the ability to determine causality. Experimental or longitudinal studies could provide stronger evidence for the relationships hypothesized in the model. Third, it is recommended to explore additional factors and potential moderators that may influence the dynamics of technology adoption and continuous use intention among educators e.g. adaptation of ITCM model for research in the field of education by adding perceived pedagogical impact (PPI) as a factor. Fourth, the absence of exploration into potential mediation effects when the theories interact and the assessment of how the multiple theories complement each other’s blind spots or interact with each other through interaction effects was not investigated. Future research could address this limitation by employing hierarchical regression analysis to illustrate the incremental contributions of each theory and investigating potential interaction effects among them. Fifth, in future research endeavors, scholars should deploy more rigorous model development and model testing techniques. Overall, this research makes a significant contribution to literature. However, further research endeavors are needed to replicate and extend the findings across diverse settings.
