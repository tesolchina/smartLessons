Cross-disciplinary analysis

Research on negation has generally explored the cross-linguistic similarities and differences of a host of widely spoken languages with little attention to its nuances within academic genres and disciplines. Accordingly, and given the co-articulation of negation with various interpersonal and evaluative resources, this study examined appraisal subsystems in 360 research articles on astrophysics, chemistry, geology, psychology, linguistics, and political science (60 papers from each discipline) published between 2018 and 2020. Comparative analyses of appraisal resources revealed significantly greater employment of total engagement and graduation, acknowledge, concede, counter, denial, distance, entertain, pronounce, justifying, affect, judgment, positive polarity of attitude, force, and softening devices in soft disciplines. However, hard sciences allowed denser employment of appreciation, neutral polarity of attitude, and sharpening resources. The results of the text/pragmatic analysis of denial further indicated a stronger preference for disalignment, cautious detachment, and unfulfilled expectations functions in soft sciences and varying negation patterns across both subcorpora. The line-by-line annotations revealed either the independent use of denial markers or their co-articulation with other appraisal options. An important implication of this study is awareness-raising about the rhetorical conventions of maintaining an authorial stance and promoting a sense of disciplinary community.

# 1. Introduction

Previous research refutes the view that written academic discourse is merely contingent on factual and impersonal information (Geng & Wharton, 2016; Hyland & Tse, 2004; McGrath & Kuteeva, 2012; Swales et al., 1998). It is now acknowledged that academic writing involves a dialogic process of knowledge construction that builds on exchanging both alternative and parallel views (Geng & Wharton, 2016). The prerequisite would be writers’ awareness and employment of engagement resources to express the convergence or divergence of their viewpoints with and from other opinions (Hood, 2010; Martin & White, 2005; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; Webber, 2014). One ongoing initiative to address the workings of writers’ ideological stance in dialogic discourse is an examination of how writers express interpersonal evaluative meanings through coarticulation of the comparatively under-researched area of negation (Swales, 2019) and other appraisal resources (Loghmani et al., 2020; Martin & White, 2005).

Considerable significance of negation to effective use of language for academic and specific purposes lies in its existence at the interface of semantic, syntactic, morphosyntactic, and logical aspects of language acquisition, language use, and sentence processing (Horn & Kato, 2000; Miestamo, 2017), its philosophical, psychological, linguistic, and cognitive delineations (Miestamo, 2017; Morante & Sporleder, 2012), its sensitivity to prosodic parameters (Rudanko, 1982), its importance in giving insights into language implicatures (Horn & Kato, 2000), its descriptive and metalinguistic aspects (Davis, 2011), its role in polite speech and euphemism (Horn & Kato, 2000), and interactions of its operations at the formal domains of grammar (e.g., morphology and phonology) and functional domains of grammar (e.g., modality, illocution, and polarity) (Miestamo, 2017). Hence, defining negation as simple operations on affirmative sentences would, in principle, be an oversimplification not accounting for its practical applications (Wales & Grieve, 1969). Conceivably, any approach to interpreting negation should build on the available scholarship on its systematic analysis (Morante & Sporleder, 2012).

Within the propositional domain of language, a particular line of research has focused on the syntactic and semantic aspects of negation to classify various languages (Avron, 1999; Croft, 1991; Dahl, 1979; De Clercq, 2020; Haegeman, 1995; Khemlani et al., 2012; Klima, 1964; Miestamo, 2007, 2017; van der Wouden, 1997). The investigations have subsumed indepth analyses of general negative contexts (van der Wouden, 1997), placement of negative morphemes (Dahl, 1979), various negative forms (Dahl, 1979; De Clercq, 2020; Haegeman, 1995; Klima, 1964; Miestamo, 2007; van der Wouden, 1997), and broad-scope (sentential) versus narrow-scope (constituent) negation (Jackendoff, 1972; Khemlani et al., 2012). Going far and wide, the second wave of research has conducted cross-linguistic analyses of negation and how different language users interpret it (Pagliarini et al., 2022; Rispens et al., 2001).

Studies in light of the syntactic view seem to have spotted negative connectives but have lost sight of their contributions to changes in truth values (i.e., truth or falsehood of denotations) (See Shramko & Wansing, 2012 for more information) of utterances. As such, attention to syntactic features alone is flawed as negative connectives do not necessarily change the affirmative sense of the sentence and are not independent of any semantical interpretations. Besides, the studies maintaining the semantic perspective would pertain solely to the intuitive meanings of connectives and their roles in changing the truth values of propositions (Avron, 1999; Miestamo, 2017). Thus, the sole focus on either syntactic or semantic aspects is merely scratching the surface and cannot do much good to grasp the particular purposes of negative constructions (Jordan, 1998). Alternatively, if a pragmatic approach is adopted, negation can be a viable means for developing arguments (Jordan, 1998) and refuting conventional assumptions against its informativeness (Givon, 1978; Leech, 1983; Russell, 1964).

The latest wave of research shifted from the purely syntactic and semantic shades of negation toward its extrapropositional aspects. Challenging the views concerning the limited pragmatic importance of negative constructions, scholars (e.g., Fryer, 2013; Jiang & Hyland, 2022; Jordan, 1998; Martin & White, 2005; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; 2022b; Tottie, 1991; Webber, 2014; White, 2003) broadened the scope of their analyses and investigated the underlying meanings and configurations of negation across contexts. Tottie (1991) categorized negation functions performed peculiarly in speech into supports, rejections, and denials and introduced an implicit subdivision of denial unique to written discourse. Likewise, tracing diachronic studies on language evolution and identifying their frequent associations of negation with foregrounding contents, Croft (1991) concluded that negation is far beyond just drawing attention to the corresponding affirmatives.

Later on, Jordan (1998) appreciated the significance of non-ideational (i.e., interpersonal and textual) functions of negation in studying relevance and called for further contextual analyses of those functions. Reformulating Gricean maxim of quantity, he concluded that language users tend to use negative forms only if affirmative structures fail to convey their intended meanings. Therefore, behind the use of negation lies logical reasons and profound rhetorical effects. Accordingly, one can refute the claims concerning less informativeness of negation and conclude that the choice of positive/negative forms depends on their purposes and conditions of use (Jordan, 1998; Webber, 2014).

Likewise, when embedded in EAP/ESP contexts, understanding the pragmatics of negation helps uncover the disciplinary conventions of authenticating academic identities. Supporting the pragmatics of negation and inspired by Jordan’s (1998) elaborations, the example I don’t think writing is discipline-specific can speak volumes. According to the requirements posed by context and intonation, the recipients can put various interpretations on the same sentence. Examples of the deduced meanings include:

A: Everybody agrees that writing is discipline-specific. How about you?   
B: No, I don’t think writing is discipline-specific.   
A: They say you think writing is discipline-specific.   
B: They are absolutely wrong. I don’t think writing is discipline-specific.   
A: They believe you only think writing is discipline-specific.   
B: I don’t think. Writing is definitely discipline-specific.   
A: Do you think writing is discipline-specific or not?   
B: I don’t think; writing is discipline-specific.   
A: How certain you are about discipline-specificity of writing?   
B: I don’t think writing is discipline-specific. It is discipline-specific.   
A: Do you think writing is discipline-specific or other modes of communication? B: I don’t think writing is discipline-specific, but other modes of communication maybe. A: Do you think writing is always discipline-specific or when it is reader-centered? B: I don’t think writing is discipline-specific, but not when it is reader-centered. A: How would you describe writing?   
B: I don’t think writing is discipline-specific.

However, when decontextualized, each of the above nuances may be questionable, especially when the language users’ backgrounds are unknown.

As an extension of the interpersonal metafunction of language (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014), the appraisal framework (Martin & White, 2005) drew attention to the cooccurrence of various communicative signals (e.g., engagement tools) that dialogistically positioned language users’ intersubjective meanings at the discourse-semantic level. Embraced in the engagement category and directed towards alternative/opposing arguments or denying/rejecting a particular stance in dialogues, negation shifted the focus of investigations away from the rhetoric of affirmatives toward writers’ strategies to map their interpersonal positioning and authorial voice (Jiang & Hyland, 2022; Loghmani et al., 2020; Martin & White, 2005; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a, 2022b).

Recent pragmatic studies have underlined the role of negation in expressing metalinguistic aspects of communication (Davis, 2011), negation vis-a-vis presuppositions (Seuren, 2000), semantic vagueness of negation (Pitts, 2011), rhetorical purposes of negation (Jiang & Hyland, 2022; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; 2022b; Webber, 2014) and the textual and ideational meanings of negation across different text types and genres (Chang & Schleppegrell, 2011; Geng & Wharton, 2016; Maswana et al., 2015; Pérez-Llantada, 2013; Swales, 2019). However, given the contribution of various lexico-grammatical categories such as verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions to the expression of negation (Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; Thompson & Ye, 1991; van der Wouden, 1997) and correspondingly the abundance of its forms, functions, and classification systems, a need is felt for further pragmatic investigations.

If any, few studies have investigated negation and its co-articulation with other appraisal options across soft and hard disciplines, and hardly any cross-disciplinary analyses of negation have adopted an SFL ensemble of formal and functional language domains and, by implication, a pragmatic approach (Don, 2017; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a). More specifically, one should conceive disciplines as contexts for language practice. Decontextualized analyses of disciplinary writing or even mere attention to technical terms as distinguishing features of academic fields is rather simplistic and misrepresents writers’ attempts to legitimize their disciplinary membership (Hyland & Bondi, 2006). Most importantly, when analyzed within the same genre, texts can adequately represent epistemological assumptions of disciplines (Fryer, 2013; Samraj, 2002, 2008). The implications can be a clear distinction between genre-specific and discipline-specific norms of practice, increased awareness of the expectations and conventions regarding knowledge communication, and thereby greater chances of academic success (Hyland, 2006; Samraj, 2002).

Also, with a dearth of studies on the interpersonal metafunction as their focal point, the question of whether forms and functions of negation vary across academic disciplines, which is ideally expected to be addressed empirically and pragmatically, has remained unanswered. To address this question, this study adopts a discourse-semantic approach from the SFL perspective and based on the appraisal framework as well as Sun and Crosthwaite’s (2022a) elaboration of negation functions to investigate the role of appraisal options, in general, and negation in particular, in mapping the authorial stance in soft and hard sciences. The analysis examines the following questions:

2. Are there any significant differences in stylistic choices of negation in soft and hard disciplines? Why or why not?

# 2. Theoretical framework

# 2.1. Martin and White’s (2005) appraisal system

The appraisal framework (Figure 1) comprises the interactive and complementary axes of attitude, engagement and graduation. The system has proved successful in detailed explorations of interpersonal meaning-making at the discoursesemantic interface across multiple genres and disciplines (Geng & Wharton, 2016; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a, 2022b; Webber, 2014). Given that negative structures are not likely to do separately from the rest of language resources (Chang & Schleppegrell, 2011; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a; Thompson & Ye, 1991), in practice, mature language users generally use a combination of interpersonal signals to get their messages across to their readers (Chang & Schleppegrell, 2011). Hence, the choice of the appraisal system could allow a comprehensive investigation of lexicogrammatical and extrapropositional manifestations of negation.

The attitude domain of the appraisal system involves the expression of feelings through affect, judgment, or appreciation. The affect side touches upon positively or negatively experienced feelings to express dis/satisfaction (i.e., failure or success in goal attainment), un/happiness (i.e., joy or misery), dis/inclination (i.e., apathy or aspiration), and in/security (i.e., poise or agitation).

1. . investors that do not pursue post-arbitration litigation are sufficiently satisfied [Satisfaction] with the arbitration outcome . (Political Science)   
2. . projection bias; that is, the tendency for respondents to place stimuli they like [Happiness] too close to themselves . (Political Science)

3. Correspondingly, we suggest [Inclination] an alternative corrosion pathway . (Chemistry) 4. There is no guarantee, of course, that all multilinguals will feel comfortable [Security] embracing translanguaging . (Linguistics)

The judgment dimension, whether inscribed (i.e., explicit) or mediated, communicates a social esteem facet reflecting different views regarding normality (i.e., how unusual) of a behavior or the capacity (i.e., the capability) and tenacity (i.e., the levels of resolution and determination) of its agent. Also, as the second division of the judgement dimension, social sanction addresses propriety (i.e., ethicality) and veracity (i.e., truthfulness):

5. . direct observation of individuals in their normal [Normality] daily routine for an extended period . (Political Science)   
6. Because students with exceptionalities, including those with disabilities, academically gifted [Capacity] students, . are often   
stigmatized. (Psychology)   
7. In a multi-member legislature including faithful [Tenacity] agents of the district median voters . (Political Science)   
8. . to perceive an unfamiliar four-week-old male infant’s spontaneous cries as manipulative [Veracity]. (Psychology)   
9. . another important point relates to being respectful [Propriety] of past research . (Psychology)

Appreciation as the third dimension of the attitude sphere discloses how people put values on signs and natural entities and is realized through reaction, valuation, and composition which correspond to the mental processes of ‘affection’, ‘cognition’ and ‘perception’, respectively (Martin & White, 2005, p. 56–57).

10. One of the fascinating [Reaction] aspects of diagenesis is that . (Astrophysics)   
11. G tries to create false [Valuation] data that looks like the genuine [Valuation] data . (Astrophysics)   
12. These contradictory [Composition] findings illustrate how much we have yet to learn . (Political Science)

The graduation domain attends to resources that express the strength of dis/alignment with other voices. It addresses the focus and force of scalability (i.e., degrees of positivity/negativity). Through focus, authors can soften or sharpen the values of unscalable qualities and entities, thereby signaling the strength of their positive or negative attitudes towards reader perceptions. The force dimension, however, reflects how much authors can up/down-scale scalable processes, or qualities to intensify a proposition (Martin & White, 2005).

13. ., people in a pure [Sharpening] state of monolingualism are harder than ever to come by, . (Linguistics)   
14. Few [Downscale] studies have been able to take advantage of higher than 1-s GPS sampling. (Astrophysics)

Finally, the engagement domain deals with resources that help writers adopt a position towards the expressed content or their readers. Engagement comprises monoglossic (i.e., with no reference to other voices) and heteroglossic (i.e., with an explicit mention of alternative voices) resources. The heteroglossic engagement resources allow the expression of alternative positions (i.e., dialogic expansion) or a reduction of the scope of a proposition (i.e., dialogic contraction). Disclaim, proclaim, entertain and attribute markers make up the subordinate categories of heteroglossic engagement. The disclaim options express authorial rejection of alternative views through either negation (i.e., deny), mainly manifested through negative cues such as ‘no’, and ‘nothing’, or contrastive conjunctions and adjuncts (e.g., however, despite) that point to unexpected voices or give other alternatives (i.e., counter) (Martin & White, 2005).

15. . is computationally demanding, meaning that the algorithm by Hansen and Klopfer (2006) cannot [Deny] be used . (Political Science) 16. Although [Counter] this reaction was previously reported . the authors encountered reproducibility issues . (Chemistry)

Proclaim markers serve to provide well-grounded information through concur (i.e., explicit reference to accepted propositions), pronounce (i.e., overt emphasis on authorial voice), and endorse (i.e., attribution of a view to an external source) features. For this dimension, scholars (e.g., Lam & Crosthwaite, 2018; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a, 2022b) have also reported justify resources such as because that give reasons for the expressed propositions:

17. Volumetric measures have also proved [Endorsement] useful for estimating vegetation biomass ... (Geology) 18. Indeed, [Pronouncing] the expected interaction between problem format . and variability (low, high) was found. (Psychology)

The concur facet is further subdivided into affirm and concede devices that usually co-occur with disclaim markers. Affirm markers represent a specific authorial voice to narrow the scope of other alternatives and concede markers first express opposition to an argument and then admit it.

Figure 1. Appraisal layers simplified (Adapted from Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a).

19. It is of course [Affirm] always possible that Jupiter was somehow special, . (Astrophysics) 20. Admittedly, [Concede] it is a stretch to go from a child kicking in its crib to the full agency of adult users of a language; nevertheless, the point should not . (Linguistics)

The entertain markers direct the readers’ attention to one of the alternative positions towards a proposition.

21. New forest communities . will likely [Entertain] optimize the use of water, nutrients, and other resources ... (Astrophysics)

The attribute dimension accredits a particular proposition through either acknowledging (i.e., highlighting the author’s neutral position) or distancing (i.e., overt reference to the author’s refusal to take charge of a voice):

22. Cialdini and Goldstein (2004) argue that [Acknowledge] this consistency motivation originates from a desire to maintain or enhance one’s self-esteem. (Linguistics)   
23. For instance, Gardner and Winner (1982) claim that [Distance] children’s pictorial understanding follows a three-stage developmental pattern. (Psychology)

# 2.2. Sun and Crosthwaite’s (2022a) elaboration of negation

For the pragmatic analysis of negation, this study benefited from Sun and Crosthwaite’s (2022a) division of negation functions into disalignment, cautious detachment, and unfulfilled expectations subtypes. In this taxonomy, disalignment pertains to explicit denial of a proposition through the employment of negators (e.g., no and not) and may not leave enough room for alternative viewpoints to strengthen authorial attitudes towards an assumption. Cautious detachment as the second category deals with the use of hedging devices to mitigate the epistemic validity of an argument and provide room for alternative perspectives. The third subtype of negation, unfulfilled expectations, represents reader or reader-writer assumptions to show similarities and differences, express discontent with and disapproval of other studies, acknowledge barriers to taking any measures and also point to author attempts through the use of hedges and modality to detach themselves from others. Typical instances of the last subcategory are correlative conjunctions such as “not merely . but also” (Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a).

# 3. Materials and methods

As useful knowledge-construction devices in most academic disciplines, research articles can respond to the need for exploring the disciplinary discourses (Hyland, 1999), particularly those of the less addressed fields, such as astrophysics (Swales, 2019). Hence, the corpus used for this study included a random sample of 360 research articles published between 2018 and 2020 on psychology, linguistics, political science, astrophysics, chemistry, and geology (60 articles from each discipline) in the top five subscription and open access journals with Q1 ranking on https://www.scimagojr.com/ in 2021. AntFileConvertor (Anthony, 2017) helped convert the pdf versions of the articles into. txt format and calculate their word counts. With the exclusion of tables, figures, footnotes, references, and appendices, the corpus (including abstracts and keywords, as the most accessible and frequently encountered parts in pre-, post-, and skim-reading the articles and scholars’ top priority for article selection (Salager-Meyer, 1992)) totaled 3,069,459 words (See Table 1).

# 3.1. Corpus annotation

NVivo 10, a user-friendly computer program, allowed access to the accompanying words (i.e., co-texts) as segmentation and coding units for manual line-by-line annotation, automatic counting, and multi-layer analysis of text segments for types (i.e., categories) and tokens (i.e., instances) (Wetzel, 2006) of appraisal options. For example, denial was an appraisal category (i.e., type) whose specific exemplars (i.e., tokens) could be devices such as not or none. A hybrid approach assisted in spotting and tagging instances of Martin and White’s (2005) classification of appraisal resources (i.e., deductive coding) together with their emerging co-articulation patterns (e.g., ‘Justify $^ +$ negation’; ‘negation $^ +$ attitude-tenacity’; ‘negation $^ +$ upscale’; See Sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2, And 4.2.3) with negation (i.e., inductive coding) in text segments of varying sizes, such as clauses and beyond. Due to the prosodic emergence and cumulative impacts of language resources, it was impractical to define clear boundaries for segmentation purposes (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014; Martin & White, 2005). In each instance, depending on the types of appraisal options, varying spans of texts served as coding units. For example, analyses of invoked modes of attitude expression generally required longer text segments.

To ensure the reliability of the coding and eliminate the potential bias in manual data coding, $2 0 \%$ of the coded texts were randomly selected and cross-checked with text annotations by two trained coders. Then, kappa tests provided coder agreement proportions on different subtypes of appraisal resources. Based on the kappa results, the indices of the researcher’s agreement with the first and second coders were respectively .98 and .97 and significantly different from zero $\left( \mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \right)$ , indicating negligible points of disagreement, later resolved through discussion and consensus. The kappa index for the first and second coder’s judgments was also statistically significant $\mathbf { k } = . 9 5$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1$ ).

The annotation process was continued and led through several steps: spotting appraisal cues, dragging and dropping them into the repository of parent and child nodes, ensuring ease of access to their neighboring context (i.e., concordance) to specify their types and tokens, followed by normalizing the frequencies based on their occurrences per 1000 words (due to unequal length of the subcorpora for comparison purposes), and comparative analyses of the densities across soft and hard disciplines.

# 4. Results and discussion

This study analyzed appraisal subsystems to unfold authors’ disciplinary-specific stance in soft and hard science articles. The corpus consisted of 47,434 units of heteroglossic engagement (density per 1000 words $= 1 5 . 4 5$ ), 24,484 units of attitude (density per 1000 words $= 7 . 9 8$ ), and 33,268 units of graduation resources (density per 1000 words $= 1 0 . 8 4 \mathrm { \AA }$ . The soft and hard disciplines comprised $5 5 . 8 6 \%$ and $4 4 . 1 4 \%$ of the resources, respectively. Units of negation explained $9 . 9 3 \%$ of the total number of appraisal resources $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 1 0 { , } 4 4 2$ , density per 1000 words $= 3 . 4$ ) which was subsumed under $6 5 . 3 \%$ $\mathrm { ~  ~ \cdot ~ } { \bf n } = 6 8 1 9$ , density per 1000 words $= 4 . 6$ ) of negation units in soft and $3 4 . 7 \%$ $\mathrm { ~ n ~ } = 3 6 2 3$ , density per 1000 words $= 2 . 2 8$ ) of negation resources in hard sciences sub-corpora.

# 4.1. Appraisal resources across soft and hard sciences

The 180 articles on soft sciences $\mathbf { M } \mathbf { d } \mathbf { n } = 4 1 . 4 3$ , $\mathsf { M A D } = 8 . 6 8$ ) compared to the 180 articles on hard sciences $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \langle } \mathrm { M d n } = 3 0 . 1$ , $\mathsf { M A D } = 7 . 0 6$ ) showed significantly greater overall use of appraisal resources $\mathrm { ~  ~ { ~ U ~ } ~ } = 8 4 4 0$ , $Z = - 7 . 8 6$ , $\mathsf { p } \mathrm { = } \mathrm { < } . 0 5 $ ). The results further demonstrated significant differences between the two groups in terms of most appraisal resources except for affirm, endorse, attitude mode, negative polarity of attitude, and total attitude options. The soft sciences outweighed the hard sciences in terms of their exercise of heteroglossic engagement (i.e., total, acknowledge, concede, counter, denial, distance, entertain, pronounce, and justify), attitude (i.e., affect, judgement, and positive polarity), and graduation (i.e., total, force, and softening) devices. However, densities of appreciation, neutral polarity of attitude, and sharpening resources in hard sciences were significantly greater than those of soft sciences (Table 2).

Broader appeal to interpersonal language, through appraisal resources, could contribute to more successful reader involvement in the discourse of soft sciences that could, in turn, echo the perceived importance of intended readers and explain the writers’ attempts to socialize with them (Fryer, 2013; Hyland, 1999, 2001; Zou & Hyland, 2020). The coarticulation of negative cues and other appraisal resources in most negative segments suggested that negating an utterance and expressing disapproval of its content should provide credible assurance to readers. Turning to various combinations of appraisal resources, writers in both knowledge divisions, in general, and in soft sciences, in particular, developed an idea of the reader characteristics to deploy convincing arguments, introduce alternative positions and point to the potential contributions of language to knowledge production (Hyland, 1999). The job of the social scientists was much more demanding since instead of dictating their stance and viewing their audience as passive recipients of information, they exposed their putative readers to contradictory theories that, by definition, underpinned a glut of ideas. As a result, thereof, and given the collective patterns of global acquisition and interchange of information, the inherent consequence was particular attention to human subjectivities as the units of knowledge production and interpretation which correspondingly could lead to a more or less equal division of power between writers and readers (Koutsantoni, 2004).

Engagement resources in soft disciplines $( \mathrm { D } = 1 8 . 7 3 )$ ) were approximately one-and-a-half times as frequent per 1000 words as in hard sciences $\mathrm { ( D } = 1 2 . 4 0 ) $ . Also, the Mann–Whitney tests indicated that affect $\mathrm { ( U } = 1 1 2 8 9 . 5$ , $Z = - 4 . 9 7$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 5 )$ and judgement resources $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { U } = 1 3 , 7 4 8$ , $Z = - 2 . 4 8$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 5 $ ) had denser coverage in soft $\mathrm { \Delta M d n _ { a f f e c t } } = 1 . 2 4$ , $\mathrm { M A D } _ { \mathrm { a f f e c t } } = . 6 5$ , Mdnjudgement $= 3 . 4 2$ , MADjudgement $= 1 . 3 3$ ) than in hard disciplines $( \mathrm { M d n } _ { \mathrm { a f f e c t } } = . 7 4 ,$ , $\mathrm { M A D } _ { \mathrm { a f f e c t } } = . 4 8$ , Mdnjudgement $= 2 . 8 4$ , $\mathrm { M A D _ { j u d g e m e n t } } = 1 . 1 4 )$ . However, hard disciplines $\mathrm { ( M d n } = 3 . 6 0$ , $\mathsf { M A D } = 1 . 3 3 $ ) showed greater employment of appreciation $( \mathrm { U } = 1 3 6 8 8 . 5 , Z = - 2 . 5 4 , \mathrm { p } < . 0 5 )$ compared with soft sciences $( \mathrm { M d n } = 3 . 1 4 , \mathrm { M A D } = 1 )$ ). These differences were consistent with the epistemological assumptions underlying knowledge development in soft and hard sciences (Parry, 1998; Zou & Hyland, 2020). Unlike the language of natural sciences that reports the events and maintains writer–reader relationships objectively, the seemingly more value-laden language and stylistic choices in human sciences echo their writers’ commitment to developing arguments to encourage readers’ comparatively subjective interpretations (Parry, 1998). The presupposition of hard sciences is integrating new information into the already accumulated knowledge. Social scientists, however, need to appeal to often contradictory theories enabling them to bring solid arguments, introduce their readers into the discourse, and gain their approval (Bazerman, 1981). Hence, rather than a first-person narrative report of the phenomena, soft science articles were more likely to employ engagement devices to communicate the dynamicity of knowledge. Accordingly, authors of soft science articles favored a top-down approach to deploy compelling arguments on the existing inconsistencies, expound on the controversies to expand the readers’ breadth of vision, and channel their views to consensually agreed positions. In reverse, limited use of engagement and affect/judgement devices in hard sciences could gear the readers’ attention to technical and standardized forms of knowledge and away from metaphorical/interpretive usages and subjectivities (Parry, 1998). The caveat is that our interpretations of interpersonal meaning-making can only work in cross-disciplinary comparisons and may not withstand the social use of language and reader indulgence in hard sciences (Hyland, 2001). Indeed, the research article genre has remained a key channel for knowledge and attitudinal dissemination (e.g., through denser use of appreciation devices) in hard sciences. However, the reasons behind the stylistic choices in natural sciences are hardly conducive to soft disciplines partly due to reader expectations of various knowledge divisions and topics (Koutsantoni, 2004; Parry, 1998).

With almost twice as frequent deny, concede, and acknowledge and about one-and-a-half times as frequent soften, downscale, pronounce, justify, and entertaining options per 1000 words as the hard subcorpus, the soft disciplines showed heavier uses of most graduation and engagement devices. Doubting readers’ knowledge and suppositions about the disseminated information and whether they would be receptive to it, writers in soft sciences needed to make a more cautious expression of the points and avoid overt surface-level assertions. The potential of dialogic expansion to open up alternative voices, the role of dialogic contraction in persuading readers to align with the authorial attitudes, and the significance of graduation devices in grading writers’ attitudes towards various value positions could thus expedite the process. Following this line of reasoning, authors of natural sciences, who tended to state unhedged facts and establish a continuum of certainty, assumed the acquisition of a definitive version of accepted knowledge on the part of their target readers and were thus more likely to take an assertive stance (White, 2003). Worthy of note is also the need for considering multiple potential readers with various value positions and attitudes towards a proposition for the successful application of dialogic contraction/ expansion domains of the appraisal framework (White, 2003).

More attention to disclaim and counter-expectation markers in soft sciences was consistent with the previous records addressing the potential of this knowledge division to underscore the significance of making distinctions between factual and subjective matters (Hyland, 1999; Webber, 2014). Being ripe for the exploitation of more disclaiming, acknowledging, and entertaining resources, the writers of soft science articles could mitigate the effects of authoritative propositions, satisfy reader expectations, and succeed in their attempts to promote solidarity with the readers. The frequent resort to pronouncing markers could further assist them in holding readers’ attention to their authorial voice and receiving their approval. The findings are congruous with previous arguments (e.g., Li & Wharton, 2012) on the homogenizing effects of disciplines and the role of disciplinary cultures on stylistic choices of interpersonal resources. Grounded on experiments in highly controlled laboratory environments, fields of natural science offered greater certainty and predictability, perhaps partly because of the mediating effects of various frames of reference that could, in turn, give rise to a lack of absolute precision in their soft theorybased counterparts (Webber, 2014). Similarly, given the largely unpredictable nature and interactive effects of human factors, it was reasonable that writers in soft sciences less assertively articulate their authorial stance and employ a relatively large number of entertaining, downscaling, and softening markers to proceed with caution (Fryer, 2013).

Through much more frequented entertaining markers than affirming and endorsing features, scholars in soft sciences could avoid the risk of disregarding readers as active knowledge producers. Likewise, entertaining devices prevented the authors from imposing their values or a sheer volume of information upon their readers and provided the means for promoting interpersonal cooperation and fending off any problems with unequal power dynamics between readers and writers (Koutsantoni, 2004). Besides, scholarly articles on fields that appreciate the multiplicity of subjectivities tend to foreground authorial research-based perspectives. Consequently, a substantial number of pronouncing and distance options could tip the balance between the textual voice and alternative positions, thereby suggesting the inclination of writers to feel accountable for their adopted methodologies while enthusiastically welcoming any challenges to their positive social value (Fryer, 2013; White, 2003).

Although less abundant in hard sciences, entertaining cues were likely to mediate any efforts to persuade the readers (Fryer, 2013) and thus boost their readership. In light of this finding and the available studies (e.g., Fryer, 2013) echoing the exercise of caution in medical research articles, it seems that sciences, no matter hard or soft, that appreciate human relations treat and take information with prudence. In support of this claim, Fryer (2013) showed that, despite being conventionally viewed as a hard science due to its focus on hard sciences such as chemistry and biology, medicine erred on the side of caution, presumably because medical experiments target humans and their unpredictable complications. Analogously, message delivery via a tentative language in hard sciences may welcome the conclusion that traditional hard and soft divisions of knowledge are not mutually incompatible. Therefore, to eschew reductionist thinking that assumes quite distinctive forms of knowledge and to succeed in grasping the intricacies of each discipline, any inferences about hard and soft sciences would be better off on a continuum (Hyland, 2013). Members of each discourse community may admittedly seek to adopt the stylistic choices that respond to the expectations of their putative readers (Hyland, 2013).

# 4.3. Stylistic choices of negation across soft and hard sciences

According to the results, not $7 2 . 3 3 \%$ , $6 8 . 7 4 \%$ , and $7 3 . 4 2 \%$ of denial markers in the whole, hard, and soft corpora, respectively) and no $2 0 . 0 1 \%$ , $2 2 . 4 3 \%$ , and $1 8 . 4 \%$ of denial markers in the whole, hard, and soft corpora, respectively) were the most prevalent markers of negation. Other resources such as nor, none, by no means, the contracted forms such as didn’t were much less frequent. Mostly co-articulated with other appraisal options, the negation devices communicated disalignment $( 7 1 . 3 3 \% )$ , unfulfilled expectations $( 2 3 . 1 3 \% )$ and cautious detachment $( 5 . 5 4 \% )$ . Independent sample t-tests indicated that compared with their hard-science counterparts, soft-science writers had a significantly greater tendency to employ all subtypes of negation (Table 3; See section 4.2.1 for further elaborations).

# 4.3.1. Negation as disalignment

In this study, negative cues predominantly performed the disalignment function. Co-articulated with other appraisal devices or independently, negation resources exhibited various patterns of deviation between authorial and alternative views. In excerpt 1, the independent application of the explicit denial marker no takes on the dual role of negating the expressed proposition and tacitly pointing to a felt gap:

1) No [Disalignment] one mineralogical ratio characterizes an exoplanet atmosphere. (Astrophysics)

Consequently, the authors can potentially promote their intended readership and generate a powerful motivation for envisaging and initiating necessary measures to rectify any conspicuous lack of thorough analyses or accurate data to delineate the exoplanet atmosphere. In excerpt 2, the negative cue no coupled with the counter-expectation device ‘however’ displays another disalignment pattern whereby it becomes possible to indicate consideration of behaviors with varying levels of attention:

2) However, [Counter] there has been no [Disalignment] systematic [Tenacity] study of the grammar used in turn beginnings with and without having established attention . (Linguistics)

The word systematic is an attitude marker that, through positioning the readers into the discourse, helps the authors deliver their judgment about the previous studies. The attitudinal value of tenacity further stresses the authors’ failure to find comprehensive studies to bridge a gap with earlier studies on grammar and can thus determine the strength of their investigation. The justifying resources (i.e., because and consequently) in excerpts 3 and 4 serve to warrant controversial propositions and their significance (Geng & Wharton, 2016; White, 2003).

3) Indeed, [Endorse] it is difficult [Capacity] to define a clear [Composition] goal of language learning because [Justify] it is not [Disalignment] fixed [Composition]. (Linguistics)   
4) Consequently, [Justify] it is not [Disalignment] surprising [Normality] that NGO and IGO monitors share similar concerns . (Political Science)

This study also showed the cooccurrence of negation and endorsement (Ex. 3), acknowledging (Ex. 5), affirmation (Ex. 6) and pronouncement (Ex. 7) devices.

5) Although [Counter] no [Disalignment] catalysis has yet [Counter] been reported [Acknowledge] with these systems, it seems [Entertain] likely [Entertain] such ligands will find utility given the success [Invoked capacity] with the phosphines ... (Chemistry)   
6) Of course, [Affirm] none [Disalignment] of the above eliminates the possibility of new data becoming available ... (Psychology)   
7) . between these extremes, and reporting linear models without testing the linearity assumption does not [Disalignment] really [Pronounce] provide much [Upscale] evidence. (Psychology)

The pronouncement marker ‘really’ in the last except implies an emphasis on the insufficiency of the available data and thus downplays the role of previous assumptions in disseminating accurate information.

# 4.3.2. Negation as cautious detachment

Entertainment markers such as hedging devices played a constructive role in demonstrating the authors’ uncertainty about the proposed assumptions (i.e., cautious detachment). In excerpt 8, for instance, the expression ‘whether or not’ indicates that the authors are uncertain about the true nature of plasma and opens up space for alternative voices.

8) This is an assumption which holds whether or not [Cautious detachment] the plasma is force free, and is a property of highly-conductive [Upscale] plasmas. (Astrophysics)

The choice of modal verbs would, might, and may in excerpts 9, 10, and 11 has also eschewed the explicit articulation of authorial positions towards the possible behaviors of nuclear reactions in Astrophysics, White Defendants in Political science, and the obtained estimates from the Chapman-Richards functions in Geology, thereby raising the possibility for the truth of opposing voices.

9) . so [Justify] they induce nuclear reactions in surface rocks and minerals that would [Entertain] not [Cautious detachment] otherwise occur naturally on Earth (Lal & Peters, 1967; Dunai, 2010) [Acknowledge] (Astrophysics)   
10) . few [Downscale] White defendants that do [Pronounce] end up in court might [Entertain] not [Cautious detachment] have been likely [Entertain] voters to begin with. (Political Science)   
11) The Chapman-Richards functions generated average estimates that may [Entertain] not [Cautious detachment] fully [Upscale] reflect the high [Upscale] variability among forest stands. (Geology)

Attribution of the ideas to an external source (i.e., acknowledge) in except 9 to maintain a neutral stance, justifying marker ‘so’ to support the claim in excerpts 9, the words ‘few’ and ‘fully’/’high’ to downscale and upscale the arguments in excerpts 10 and 11, respectively and the pronounce marker ‘do’ in excerpt 10, have further encouraged the interpersonal reader-writer exchanges of information.

# 4.3.3. Negation as unfulfilled expectation

The general trend to inform the readers about unfulfilled expectations was the persuasive use of negation to arouse readers’ expectations about an event, followed by a detailed refutation of the anticipated outcomes and demand for reconsidering the generally held assumptions. In excerpt 12, for example, the adverb ‘just’ follows the denial marker ‘not’ to initially convey and subsequently challenge the prevailing views to show that the variations with cluster mass are not limited to enriched stars but the extent of enrichment:

12) It is not [Unfulfilled expectation] just [Downscale; Counter] the fraction of enriched [Composition] stars that varies with cluster mass; it is also the extent of the enrichment . (Astrophysics)

In another example, the authors have used citations to support the recognition and acknowledgment of limitations in the available scholarships, and then their choice of the counter-expectation device ‘but’ adds exceptions to that claim (Excerpt 13).

13) Many [Upscale] scientists are usually [Normality] self-aware enough [Upscale] to know and communicate the limitations of their research, in ways that are intellectually [Capacity] humble [Propriety] (e.g., Alfano et al., 2017), [Acknowledge] but [Counter] some [Downscale] scientists do not [Unfulfilled expectation] . (Psychology)

The analyses showed that the graduation domain of the appraisal system could also fit into the spotted patterns of expressing dissatisfied assumptions. The parenthetical note in excerpt 14, for example, displays the choice of ‘most’ to strengthen the truth value of the observed behaviors of alpine glacial landforms, coupled with the word ‘some’ to mitigate the force of that proposition and direct attention to what usually happens in reality.

14) . sites near [Upscale] the margins of past or present continental ice sheets have moved up and down in relation to the atmosphere due to [Justify] glacioisostatic depression and uplift (although [Counter] most [Upscale] alpine glacial landforms are not [Unfulfilled expectation] near [Upscale] large [Upscale] ice sheets, this applies to some [Downscale] of the calibration data). (Astrophysics)

Co-articulation of negation and entertainment markers (Ex. 15) constituted the other arrangement of appraisal options that was analogous to the already discussed patterns of signifying disalignment and cautious detachment. The adjective ‘likely’ in excerpt 15 is an entertainment device that distinguishes the workings of isolated small planets in the KB from the normal behaviors of other planets:

15) However, [Counter] the massive [Upscale] energy inputs required to tidally evolve Triton to its present, near-circular [Upscale] orbit around Neptune likely [Entertain] modified this object in substantial [Upscale] ways, complicating comparisons. Such difficulties [Composition] are likely [Entertain] not [Unfulfilled expectation] the case for isolated small [Downscale] planets in the KB . (Astrophysics)

To answer the second research question, this study unearthed individual uses of denial markers and their co-articulation patterns with attitude, engagement and graduation resources to express disalignment, cautious detachment, and unfulfilled expectations. Compared with soft disciplines, the hard sciences showed a less frequent resort to the negation functions (Table 3). The practice may be due to the clear and unambiguous style of scientific prose (Klimova, 2013), let alone the applied linguists’ added advantage in accessing a repertoire of metalinguistic and pragmatic knowledge to identify and convey illocutionary forces in the soft subcorpus. Just like researchers in soft sciences, natural scientists may toy with subjective ideas, but the nature of science and the ruling conventions of the scientific discourse call for accepting the scientific accounts as they claim to be (Bloomfield, 1935). Hence, there were chances that stylistic elements, such as negation for internal states of writers such as surprise and emphasis be less frequent in scientific discourse (See Table 2 for attitude and graduation statistics). Beyond the likely extrapolations, however, different writers can show various accounts of their findings if they are to meet the contextual demands (Mulkay & Gilbert, 1982). These arguments may support the tendency of experts in natural sciences to give up the face value conventions and show a highly prevalent resort to quite a few appraisal signals. Still and all, it is not reasonable to create distinct boundaries for the ‘technical dialects’ of different disciplines because, despite sounding reasonably plausible, the soft-hard division argument cannot always prove valid (Bloomfield, 1935).

The identified patterns and types of rhetorical effects for negation invalidate the previous arguments (e.g., Wason, 1965) that downplay the significance of negation through confining it to only a handful of functions, such as denial, contrast, or opposition. Indeed, these findings appear to corroborate the arguments about the potential of negative cues to convey a broad range of interpersonal/pragmatic meanings across larger sociocultural and textual contexts (e.g., Jordan, 1998). More specifically, the results could indicate the depth and breadth of the nuances of meaning not otherwise expressed through affirmative structures, thereby drawing attention to negation as a pragmatically marked element able to communicate many shades of meaning (De Swart, 2010).

Though much (about 11 and 10 times as less in hard and soft disciplines, respectively) less common than explicit inscriptions, the writers’ choice of covert forms of negation through invoked appraisals could account for the significance of both categories in exerting specific stylistic and rhetorical effects such as caution or revealing presuppositions about the addressed issues. For example, invoked attitude markers conveying a negative sense could maintain a cautious stance by mitigating negativity, modifying the illocutionary forces of the utterances, and matching the level of the text to the competency level of its addressees. Besides, the professional dialect of a discipline is, by definition, understandable to the members of the same or a similar community of experts who can presuppose the propositional content of their texts (Bloomfield, 1935). Hence, with ample evidence bearing out an unsophisticated understanding of the ensuing negation, there would be less need to envisage highly explicit cues (Kaup et al., 2007). Furthermore, the need for concise writing may encourage academics to learn more about their disciplinary conditions for information interchange, thereby rendering the research article genre more susceptible to the implicit and evaluative forms of negation.

Negative structures in both subcorpora performed disalignment, unfulfilled expectations, and cautious detachment functions. The differences could provide information on their disciplinary cultures and stylistic features. Characterized by their prime focus on objective reality and precise specifications of phenomena and a significantly lower tendency to employ most attitude and graduation resources, the fields of science tended to report the events as they happened (Klimova, 2013; Mulkay & Gilbert, 1982; Quirk et al., 1985). By contrast, human sciences dealt with an ocean of psychic attributes rendering themselves liable to indirect observations, thus increasing the likelihood of slightly relative accounts of the phenomenon. By this fiat, scholars in soft sciences, which are subject to several errors of measurement (Bachman, 1990), could not find it easy to exactly “tell it like it is” (Mulkay & Gilbert, 1982, p. 310) and accordingly appealed more to the evaluative forms of negation.

Significantly greater exploitation of attribution resources, mainly through citations, could further signify special consideration of intertextuality and account for more intense uses of negation for unfulfilled expectations, disalignment, and cautious detachment in soft sciences. Given the nature of soft disciplines that could eliminate the possibility of overt acceptance/rejection of earlier accounts and their broader contexts of consideration, and also less reliance on human interpretations/subjectivities in hard sciences, it could stand to reason to observe a significantly higher number of attribution options in the former. Notwithstanding their rhetorical effects in soft sciences, citations could typically confirm the validity of hard science findings and support their integration into the existing literature (Hyland, 2013). For one thing, hard sciences follow a sequential path to reinforce earlier steps in knowledge construction. For another thing, scholars in soft sciences appreciate unpredictability, nonlinearity, negotiability, and heterogeneity of knowledge and its emergence out of dispersed pieces of data and accordingly put efforts into replicating the previous studies and examining the effects of the addressed attributes in other contexts. The possible implication can be a lack of uniform standards to accept an interpretation as absolute truth in every context (Hyland, 2013; Zou & Hyland, 2020) and the demand for a great deal of effort to persuade, engage, and convince the readers to accept an attitude, thereby higher frequencies of linguistic devices to exert various rhetorical effects in soft disciplines. Conversely, scholars in natural sciences presuppose the objective and cumulative nature of knowledge, thus calling for less intervention on the part of writers (Zou & Hyland, 2020), also evident through their intensive focus on neutral attitudes.

Altogether, soft sciences could better meet the preconditions for all subtypes of negation. Highly dense employment of counter-expectation devices could warrant frequent indications of disalignment with the readers’ viewpoints (Hood, 2010; Sun & Crosthwaite, 2022a). Also, by turning to agreed-on knowledge with potential readers, soft disciplines could gain readers’ trust as a prerequisite for communicating unfulfilled expectations (Zou & Hyland, 2020). However, in hard sciences, references to readers’ scientific background could mediate accretive knowledge construction, thereby a lower possibility of challenging reader expectations (Zou & Hyland, 2020). Also, at odds with the earlier accounts on less informativeness of negation, the results supported the feasibility of employing negation to display linguistic subtleties not otherwise conveyed through affirmation. Still, a far cry from their positive forms, negated expressions, such as He did not go to school, entwine affirmative substitutes, such as He went to the cinema or He stayed home. Hence, adequate reasons can explain the prioritization of negatives in writers’ stylistic choices (Jiang & Hyland, 2022; Morante & Blanco, 2021; Orenes et al., 2014; Webber, 2014).

# 5. Conclusion

The present results on disciplinary specificity of appraisal employment can raise academic writers’ awareness of their disciplinary conventions of deciphering and communicating meanings and the effects of writers’ choices on their audience. Gaining insights into the disciplinary discourses can also help less experienced writers more effectively express their authorial voices and increase the publishability of their research (Fryer, 2013; Hyland, 2013). Another important implication of this study is dispelling the misconceptions of academic writing as a common core practice and their detrimental effects, such as misrepresenting the disciplinary communities, downplaying the importance of their needs and ideological perspectives, and introducing their established practices as decontextualized and taken-for-granted (Hyland, 2013, 2018). Understanding the routine rhetorical choices of negation across disciplinary discourses can also assist in translating propositions and avoiding misinterpretation of ideas.

The findings can make it indispensable to practitioners in EAP/ESP learning, research, instruction, and materials development to avoid decontextualized consideration of rhetorical devices and conceive ESP/EAP in the plural as literacies rather than literacy as a single concept (Bhatia, 2002). Considering the research-based evidence, teachers can take a step further from the prescriptivist proficiency-based to descriptive discipline-specific approaches with a shift of focus from language to discourse (Hyland, 2018). Consequently, the students would become more motivated as they can ensure tight alignment of classroom instruction with their future needs. By implication, rather than being passive recipients of knowledge and mimicking already-established conventions of writing, students may view ESP/EAP research as an opportunity to discover their disciplinary identities.

Investigating the appraisal resources with their culminating patterns and prosodically-represented meanings across disciplinary discourses was a demanding task that could not be entirely devoid of limitations. More specifically, given the clear link between thinking and writing, unaddressed roles of writers’ cultural and linguistic backgrounds can tamper with the generalization of the findings to all contexts and call for addressing the regulatory effects of negation on the associated disclosure of authorial stance across L1 and L2 contexts. Correspondingly, future data may reveal further operations of negation across disciplinary discourses.
