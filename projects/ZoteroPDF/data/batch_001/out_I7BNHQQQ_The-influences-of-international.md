Previous research has found that L2 student writers use inquiry and monitoring to elicit feedback, but few studies have investigated the impact of feedback seeking behaviours (FsB) on student feedback literacy and their learning contexts. To address these issues, the current study drew on an ecological perspective to explore two international master's students' self-initiated FsB in the UK academic environment. Qualitative data analysis of interview transcripts revealed that both students proactively sought feedback, albeit from distinct sources (i.e., peer feedback vs. teacher feedback). As they chose to seek feedback from their preferred sources, they created greater learning opportunities, which in turn enhanced their dispositions to seek and use feedback, capabilities of eliciting, evaluating feedback and judging their own work, and knowledge about feedback and assessment. The process of seeking feedback also enabled them to construct connections with a wider range of feedback interactants, access more artefacts, and therefore cultivate a more supportive feedback ecology with richer affordances. The uncovered incremental but unbalanced development of student feedback literacy facilitated by FSB, as well as the changes of feedback contexts induced by FSB, provides new insights into the close relationship between FSB, student feedback literacy, and feedback ecology.

# 1. Introduction

Recent research on feedback in EAP writing situations and in higher education contexts has shifted from a one-way transmissive model to a learner-centred, process-based, context-sensitie model feedback (Boud & Molloy, 2013; F. Li & Han, 2023; Yang, 2023; Yang & Carles, 2013), which highlights shared responsbilities of multiple parties involved in feedback practice (Winstone, Nash, Parker, & Rowntre, 2017). This paradigm shift considers EAP student witers, as well a other novice academic witers, as agents who strategicall use fdback to reach their goals (u & Liu, 2021). However, feedback from teachers has ofen been reproached for being untimely, incomprehensible, and even disheartening (Anderson, 2021; Casanave, 2002; Seror, 2008). Simply engaging with feedback given by other i thus inufficient to facilitate the development of EAP writing abilities and content knowledge. That is, rather than await feedback, astudent often needs to proactively eek feedback (F. Li & Han, 2023; Winstone et al., 2017; Yu & Liu, 2021) through explicit request(i.e., inquiry) and/or implicit observation (ie, monitoring, Leenknecht, Hompus, & van der Schaaf, 2019). Empirical research on feedback seeking behaviours (FsB) has bee conducted with diverse populations, ranging from local students (Zhan, Yao, & Zhu, 2023) to international students (J. Zhou, Deneen, Tai, & Dawson, 2023). For the latter group, particularly those in their frst year of overseas study, seeking feedback can be even more pressing because their unfamiliarity with the new institutional and so. ciocultural contexts, coupled with their developing academic literacy necestates ther extra efforts to obtain resource for academic success (ibid.).

Previous research suggests that FSB is closely interrelated with student fedback literacy, which principall involves students' capacities and dispstions t elicit, proces and use eack, as well as gnerat intnal feedback (Cares, 2022; Molloy, Boud, Henderson, 2020). Whil students' feedback literacy shapes their search for and engagement with feedback opportunities (Carles, 2020; F. Li & Han, 2022), students fedback-seeking experiences can aso feed into their feedback literacy, such as their percetions, beliefs, and capabilites related to seeking and using feedback (Joughin, Boud, Dawson, & Tai, 2021). However, except for a few empirical studie (Hoo, Deneen, & Boud, 2022; J. Zhou et al., 2023), EAP writing research and 2 writing reearch has ften focused on the role of student engagement with feedback, rather than the role of FSB, in the development of student feedback literacy.

In addition to interacting with student feedback literacy, FB can also influence the contexts in which specific fedback practice is embedded. The dialogical conceptualisation of feedback recognises human agency as interacting with the context, which resonates with an ecological perspective on human development that stresses \*the progressive, mutual accommodation between an active, growing human being and the changing properties of the immediate settings in which the developing person lives' (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, p. 36, talics added). The action of feedback seeking, therefore, not only utilises the existing learning opportunitis within the context, but may even change the context. When a student elicts some information that would have not been accessed otherwise, his or her connections to potential feedback providers may be stngthened or weakened. This i ilustrated in Seror's (2011) study, in which the participating students changed feedback conditions by seeking peer feedback to compensate for untimely teacher feedback. Although fedback studies, including those informed by an ecological perspective (Chong, 2021; Han, 2019), have highlighted the contextual impact on students involvement i fedack process the other direction of the relationship, i., the influences of FSB on feedback context, has largely been overlooked (except for Seror, 2011). This case study therefore draws upon an ecological perspective to investigate the under-researched influences of FSB on student feedback iteracy and on feedback contexts.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. The relationship between FSB and student feedback literacy

Research into FSB was pioneered in management studies (de Stobbeleir, Ashford, & Buyens, 2011; VandeWalle, 2003) and later introduced into the fields of higher education (Joughin et al, 2021), SLA (Papi, Rios, Pelt, & Ozdemir, 2019), L2 writing (Papi) Bondarenko, Wawire C. Jiang, & S. Zhou, 2020), and academic writing (Sung, 2022; J. Zhou et al., 2023). In L2 writing research, FSB is defined as students \*intentional, calculated, and strateic atempts to gather feedback information on their 2 writing performance' (Papi, Bondarenko, Wawire, Jiang, & Zhou, 2020, p. 486), and is oten implemented through two strategies: inquiry and monitoring (Ashford, Blatt & VandeWalle, 2003; Papi et al., 2020). The former refers to students' direct requests for feedback from teachers, off-campus academics friends, or family (Papi et al., 2020; Pilbeam, Lloyd-Jones, & Denyer, 2013; Seror, 2011). Contrastingly, monitoring isubtle and implicit. Students notice and gather information embedded in the context to guide their revision and future learning through reflecting on previous feedback (Ya0 & Zhu, 2022), elf-evaluating using rubrics, examples, or peer work (Y. Zhou, Yu, B. Liu, & L. Jiang, 2022), and learning from teacher feedback on peers' performance (Ohta, 2000).

Originating in education reearch (Sutton, 2012), the construct student feedback liteacy has evolved over the past decade (Carless & Boud, 2018; Nieminen & Carless 202; Yu & Liu, 2021). The widely adopted social cognitive perspective on student fedack literacy saw this construct as more f a measurable, lner-intel skllset highlighting lear agency (Yu, Zhang, & Liu, 2022; Zhan, 2022a), but this conceptualisation has been criticise for encouraging adeficit discourse and not doing full justice to the contextalised nature of student fedack iteracy (iemnen & Carles 2022). In reonse  this isue, student fedack iteracy has  bee conceived of as an open, emergent system distributed between individual students, other agents, and even artefacts such as books, ccessible PCS, and virtual/physical learning spaces (Chong, 2021; Gravett, 2022).

Different conceptualisations of student feedback literacy have implications for its relationship with FsB. Earlier definitions of student feedback literacy emphasised students' dispositions and capacities to appreciate, sense-make, and enact feedback (Carless & Boud, 2018; Sutton, 2012), without explicitl referring to FSB. Later, fedback-seeking abilities, under the term of "\*elicit[ing] in formation to improve learning", constituted one of the seven categories of student feedback literacy in Molloy et al's (2020, p. 530-534) learning-centred framework for feedback literacy. However, student feedback literacy can also be conceptualised as enabling FSB (Carles, 2022), especially in terms of facilitating feedback monitoring. FSB may not take place if students have no intention or abilit to select and evaluate information sources or to decide on and mobilis feedback-seeking actions (Zhan, 2021). These dispositions, knowledge, and skills are probably distinct from those underlying one's engagement with provided feedback. Despite the inconsistently conceptualised relationship between FSB and feedback literacy, researchers largely agree that (a) FSB cannot occur without some degree feedack literacy (Carless 2020; Yan & Carles, 2022), and that (b) student feedback literacy is not solely learner-internal but often shaped by sociocultural and situational factors (Chong, 2021).

Research also sugget that stdnt feedback iteracy may grow as students practise thr skill in sking, understanding, and using feedback (Malecka, Boud, & Carless 2020). Seeking fedback requires students to reflect on their knowledge gap and performance to decide what feedback toseek, as well as where and how to eekthat feedback (Yan & Carless 22). As they seek eedback students may become more appreciative of feedback from multiple sources, understand and evaluat feedback bettr (T. Zhang & Mao, 2023), self-ases their academic progres, idntify areas for improvement (Yan & Carles, 2022), and update strategie [..] in response to changes in their ongoing goals, needs, and abilities" (Winstone et al., 2017, p.9. However, the experience f failing to eicit helpful feedback can make students undervalue future feedback and erode their trust in feedback providers (Rovagnati, Pit, & Winstone, 2022), thereby undermining student feedback literacy.

Although previous empirical studies have investigated the development of student feedback literacy (T. Zhang & Mao, 2023), researchers often deploy pedagogical interventions (ibid.) or investigate the impact of students' use of received feedback on their feedack literacy (F.L & Han, 2022). What has be overlooked is how self iated FB may inluencetdent fedback litracy. Such proactive FSB merits scholarly attention, as it often signifies a student writer's sense of ownership over their writing and an active response to the broader ecosystem of their writing contexts (Dudley-Marling & Oppenheimer, 1995).

# 2.2. Feedback seeking from an ecological perspective of learning

One obstacle to exploring the interface between student feedback literacy and FSB, however, is the theoretical disonance between the two lines of research: although feedback literacy has been understood from both a psychologicall oriented perspective and a socioculturally oriented perspective (Nieminen & Carles, 2022), FB has largely been studied as a psychological process (Zhan e al. 2023). This incongruity suggests a need to resituate FSB using an alternative conceptualisation. To this end, the current study draws upon van Lier's (1997, 2003, 2004) ecological perspective on language learning, whose emphasis on the adaptive, emergent, and activity-based nature of learning has informed recent feedback literacy research underpinned by social epistemologies and socio-cultural theories (Chong, 2021; Nieminen & Carless, 2022).

An ecological perspective views a learning environment as encompassing allinterrelationships between an organism (eg, a learner) and the surrounding world (van Lier, 1997, 2004). These relationships are dynamicall constructed as a person exercises agency to perceive and use linguistic (eg, language resources), social (eg, teacher-student or pr interactions), and cogntive (e.g, problem-solving and critical thinking) ffordances in the environment, ie., opportunitiesto make meaning and establish relevance (Kramsch & Whiteside, 2008; van Lier, 1997, 2004) van Lier (2000) uses an analogy of aleaf in a forest that can offr shelter for a tree frog o fr arpilar t istrat   ie roureack n r c  meiver r f different learners based on their perspecties and needs. Using affordances is a processin which learning and development emerge (van ier. 2004). Development from an ecological perspective involves not only a learner's growing understanding of the environment in relation to him/herself, but also the learner's growing capacity to change the contexts (or the ecosystem) of development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).

By implication, learners can be considered agents in a feedback ecology, which involves dynamic and bidirectional relationships between themseles and the physical, social, and semiotic surroundings related to feedack. In a feedback ecology, students seek, receive, select, and use feedback and feedback-related affordances (Ajjawi, Mollo, Beaman, & Ree, 2017; Han, 2019) for different purposes, such as fine-tuning their undrtanding and us ffedack (therey fostering their stdent fedack iteracy, Chong, 2021), expanding their subject-matter knowledge and L2 writing competence, adjusting their academic performance (Y. Li, Hyland, & Hu, 2017), or managing to survive in a challenging course at minimal cost (F. Li & Han, 2022).

From an ecological perspective, FSB warrants close attention because of its potential to foster individual development and to change the feedback ecology. FSB allows learners (a) to seize and even create learning opportunities by making the most out of the feedback ecology (han, 2022b), and (b) to expressteir unique needs to aid providers in taioring their feedback (de Klijn, Meijer, Brekelmans, & Pilot, 2015). The act of approaching someone for fedback also signals the learner's trust in and openness to the feedback provider (Yang & Carles, 2013), which may contribute to the psycho-social atmosphere f the learning context (Peng, 2012, p. 211).

In addition, as learners may use monitoring, i., observing and reflecting on contextual clues (including feedback given to others, Ohta, 2000) to promote their learning (Yao & Zhu, 2022), the impact f FSB may go beyond the immediate interlocuters in a feedack dyad and benefit a wider range of students. Since fellow students may interact with one another face-toface and/or online, changes in their feedback literacy and subject matter knowledge may generate impacts on the entire feedback ecology.

Although researchers such as Zhou et al. (2023) have investigated students' attempts to see fedback from various sources, very few empirical studies have explored the influences of FSB on feedback ecology. Such explorations are needed to enrich the current understanding of the complex and dynamic interactions betwen individual students, thir fedback interactants, artefact, and other social, physical, and semiotic aspects of the surrounding world that may play a part in feedback-fostered learner development (or lacking thereof). We thus conducted a multiple-case study on international students' self-initiated FSB to address two research questions:

1) How do international master's students' experiences of seeking feedback influence their feedback literacy?   
2) How does their FsB influence their feedback ecologies?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Context and participants

The current study is part of a larger qualitative investigation into study-abroad students' feedack experiences in an MA TESOL programme in a UK universt. In the first term of the programme, students were required to take four courses and complete five endof-term essays, on which wrtten and/or oral eedback could be olicited before submission (Table 1). These courses were co-taught by multiple instructors (referred to as Instructor A, , , andD), each f whom served as the convenorf a different cours, responsible for administrative tasks, such as organising a Q&A session. All esays were assigned in Week 4 and collected in Week 12.

# 3.2. Data collection

A multipl case study approach was adopted to gain an in-depth and contextualised understanding of the focal students' FSB, their feedback literacy, and the evolution of their feedback cologies. To understand the participants feedback-seeking experiences from an emic perspective, we conducted rtrospective interviews and collected material artefacts that the participants voluntarily shared with us, including assgnment requirements, the participants notes taken in Q&A sessions and tutorial, as well as teacher-student email. Allemail crrespondence and students discussion about teacher feedback included in this study (see Extract 12 and Appendix B) were shared with the explicit consent of the instructors and students involved. This extensive dataset served as prompts for retrospective interviews, enhanced our understanding of the context, aided in constructing case narrtives, and enabled the triangulation of findings that had emerged from the self-reported data.

Data collection started when essays were assigned and ended by the submission deadine. Each participant was interviewed three times: (a) upon receiving the essay assignment, (b)afer finshing the first draft, and (c) upon completing the final draft for submssion (Table 3). All semi-tructured one-on-one interviews were audio-recorded and conducted in Mandarin Chinese (the participants frst language). The interview data were transcribed verbatim and translated into English by the first author for reporting.

# 3.3. Data analysis

Data analysis commenced with compiling the cases and applying content analysis, as described by Patton (2002). Interview transcripts were repeatedly read to identify participants FSB instances which they deemed memorable and significant to their academic survival. Thirty-six data excerpts key to answering the research questions were identified and manually open-coded. Twenty-nine codes were generated, such as feedback inquiry, feedback monitoring, teacher feedback source, peer feedback source, immediate feedback interactants, remote fedback interactants. This was followed by recursive consolidation and revision of codes and categories, a process grounded in the literature and the empirical data. The identified data excerpts were aso cros-linked to material artefacts totriangulate the preliminary findings, which helped to refine codes and categories and to develop in-depth case narratives to account for two participants feedback-seeking journey. The finalised codes and categorie are presented in Appendix A. To enhance the trustworthiness of data analysis the second author also coded the entire dataset. An initial inter-coder agreement of $8 5 \%$ was achieved, and subsequent disagreements were all resolved after discussion.

# 4. Findings

The focal students, Mai and Chen, were open and positive towards feedback in general. Both proactively sought feedback, albeit from distinct sources, with Mai approaching pers and Chen instructors. These diverging decisions resulted in their distinct feedbackseeking experiences and feedback ecologies, but both improved their feedback literacy in this process.

4.1. Mai: fostering feedback literacy and enriching feedback ecology through seeking peer feedback

# 4.1.1. Perceiving constraints in teacher feedback

Mai demonstrated qualitie of an eficient feedback seeker at the outse f the MA programme. She strategically evaluated the cost and value of seeking fedback from differen sources, and took selective actions correspondingly. Mai identified the weaknesses in her essay organisation and consulted with an instructor. However, she considered teacher fedack that he received as evasive, unhelpful, and even irritating, which undermined her perception of affordances in teacher feedback, as shown in Extract 1.

"Wat the instctr sad s rritatig. When showd her y essy otline ad askdwhethe I an diss . in Stin3., she said, I wouldn't do that. But she did not tel me what I should do. I just fel that teachers here do not provide any specific advice. This is annoying" (Mai, RI-I, Extract 1).

Simultaneously, she noticed aconstraint of eeking teacher feedback due to a conflict between instructors prolonged response time to emails and the impending deadline of assignment submission:

"When I emailed my instructors on Friday, they would reply me next Monday. But I wanted to insh writing this weekend because the deadline is next Monday' (Mai, RI-II, Extract 2).

In addition, Mai feared citicism from instructors, which limited the length of time, depth of discssion, and richness o information exchanged during feedack-seeking interactions. She was burdened by the teacher's dual role fducator and assessr, worrying about repercussions of her blunt questions on the teacher's impression of her. She thus restrained herself from proposing questions to teachers, as she reported in Extract 3.

"In the tutorial, the teacher tught me how to improe my eay; however, I heitated to ask why, fearing that might ppear ignorant and prompt the teacher to assume I was unfamiliar with the theories she had taught us" (Mai, RI-II, Extract 3).

4.1.2. The impact of soliciting peer feedback on Mai's feedback literacy and her feedback ecology Having perceived constraints of teacher feedback, Mai decided to solicit peer support instead:

"So, I've got to ask my classmates or sometimes Xuejie [senior female eers] as soon as I an, in order to resolve my confusion (Mai, RI II, Extract 4).

Mai also found pers more approachable, which allowed for exploiting learning opportunities and cultivating a supportive feed back ecology.

"I felt more at ease dcussing my work with my classmate. et I could tuly express my doubts nd understand their ideas better (Mai, RI-II, Extract 5).

These interactions were facilitated by physical environments conducive to exchanging ideas between students:

We wrote essays together in the library. Sometimes they also visited my house for casual conversations" (Mai, RI-II, fficient peer interactions were made possible also because of their shared learning objective:

"I often discussed the Language Awareness asignment with a girl because she was also working on it' (Mai, RI-II, Extract 7)

That sharing a common learning goal can facilitate students' network formation has also been found in a doctoral educational context by Pilbeam et al. (2013), although the researchers cautioned that such a network could only be partially acesed because each doctoral student's research project is unique. By contrast, the fact that masters' students in our study worked on the same assigned topics cultivated an enabling feedback-seeking ecology.

Moreover, being comfortable with bothering her socially closer, native Chinese peers, Mai had more honest and elaborated feedback discussions in their shared L1, as she recognised in Extract 8.

"Perhaps the relationship with peers is closer. I can debate (zheng-bian, i) with them because we have a close psychological connection. [...] We can understand each other better when speaking Chinese" (Mai, RI-II, Extract 8).

The word debate" shows the dialogical and critical nature of feedback interactions that Mai initiated with peers. She straight forwardly probed into her peers' understanding and raised follow-up questions, as she elaborated in Extract 9:

"We argue in a way like . How can you understand it like this? Don't you think it should be blah blah .. Oh, that's what you mean'.   
Through talking back and forth, I can understand their ideas better' (Mai, RI-II, Extract 9).

Engaging in such critical dialogues, Mai and her pers explored, monitored, and reflected on knowledge about writing by inte grating varous source at their disposal ( lesso slide and tacher fedback on fellow stdent writig), as sn in Extract 10 and Extract 11.

"Initilly, Icouldntevenunderstand the asignment requirement She showed me the PowerPoint slides of the leson and explained to me [...] from what perspective I should consider writing' (Mai, RI-I, Extract 10).

"When I was working on the SLA assignment, I asked my friend if I could link the behaviourism to my teaching experince. My friend cautioned me against this, as Instructor D had advised her [via email o focus on learning experience, not teaching experience (Mai, RIII, Extract 11).

Extracts 10 and 11 indicated that candid, critical peer interactions largely enriched Mai's feedback ecology by allowing more affordances to merge, including unsolicited information, such as teacher feedback that peers willingly shared and cited to justf thir suggestions to Mai. In fact, had she not sought peer feedback, Mai could not have accessed these pieces of teacher feedback. As mentioned in Extract 11, Mai's friend gnerously showed her an mail from Instructor  (ee Extract 12), which clarified the boundary of the 'context' section of the essay.

"You must reflect retrospectively on your own previous L2 learning experiences or your students' L2 learning experiences and explain how your new knowledge of SLA theory informs your understanding of these experiences. Note that this aspect of the task is about L2 LEARNING, not L2 TEACHING' (Instructor D's original email excerpt, emphasis in original, Extract 12).

Having been informed by the email excerpt, Mai promptly adjusted her original focus of that section, which reflects her growing feedback literacy in terms of \*making sound academic judgments about their [her] own work' (Carles & Boud, 2018, p. 1319).

# 4.1.3. Student feedback literacy fostered by feedback monitoring

In addition to asking peers for feedback, Mai also benefited from the affordances of the ecology as she had aces to others online discussion about fedback, ie., monitoring. Mai was part of a virtual community involving al Chinese master's students in the MA programme on Wechat, one of the most popular social media platorms in China. Mai described how she sought fedback from the virtual community on Wechat:

[The virtul community] often dicussed assignment topic togther in the chat group] by citing nd interpretig the instructors words [obtained in Q&A sessions and tutorials] (Mai, RI-II, Extract 13).

Extract 13 shows that Mai was able to observe online dscussion (see Appendix B for an example screenshot) among an extensive number of fllow students with whom she was not ncessarily acquainted, and used monitoring to arie at useful fedback embedded in the discussion.

Although peer discussion helped to interpret teacher feedback, Mai was sometimes misled by peers whose feedback iteracy was also limited. In the Q&A session of the Research Methods course, the instructor suggested excluding \*research strategies" from the essay, but this instruction conflicted with the exemplar provided by the same instructor, as the exemplar did include this part. The contradiction confused Mai deeply. In a peer discussion afer the Q&A sessin, Mai found this confusion shared by her classmates, as she described in Extract 14.

"A classmate said we can't write this. However, some students have indeed witten about rearch strategies. They belie that research strategy', may it be quantittiv or qualitative, can be integrated into rearch design if we want to reort it i thessay. Anyway, this dispute lasted until the final submission' (Mai, RI-II, Extract 14).

Mai did not take part in this prolonged, unresolved peer discussion, but took a monitoring strategy. She scrutinised and evaluated all materials and resources at her disposal, including peer fedback, essay prompts, exemplars, to generate intenal feedback that facilitated a better understanding of the instructor's suggestion in the Q&A session, as seen in Extract 15:

"I'm unsure whose opinion to follow. . o, I revisitd th esay prompt and examined the exemplr once more.  pondered why there is a contradiction between the instructor's suggestion and the exemplar. I don't think the teacher intended to confuse us" (Mai, RI-I, Extract 15).

Later, Mai noticed the differences between the exemplar and the expected performance of her esay, as she explained in Extract 16 This discovery helped her to establish a more flexible, contextualise, and in-depth understanding of feedback and even assessment "Initidly, I thought we could imitate everything from the exemplars. Late, I realise that perhaps last year's ssignment topic might be differnt from ours. The intructor may have added new requirements, so I can't simply emulate the 'research trategy' of the exemplar" (Mai, RI-III, Extract 16).

In summary, influenced by contextual factors ranging from interpersonal relationship (camaraderie among peers), time (delayed or timely feedack provision), space (physical and virtual leaning environment) and sociocultural context (shared academic, linguistic, and cultural background), Mai hfted her major feedack source from tachers to pes. n this proces, she also reshaped her fedback ecology, from one constrained by perceived evasive, unhelpful teacher feedback, to one enriched by supportive per fedback and extensive learning resources with abundant affordances. More importantly, thoseaffordances often emerged spontaneously in the peer feedback environment, as pers had volunteered to share various larning materils that Mai would not have accessed. While culti vating and navigating this feedback ecology, Mai further enhanced her feedback literacy by sensitising herself to the anticipated academic performance, evaluating peer feedack, and identifying cues from diverse, contextualised learning sources or feedback artefacts.

4.2. Chen: enhancing feedback literacy and cultivating a feedback ecology through triangulating feedback from multiple teachers

4.2.1. Eliciting and incorporating feedback from different instructors

While Mai preferred negotiating with peers, Chen constantly sought feedback from instructors, due to her firm belief i teachers and positive prior experience in obtaining such feedback:

"I trust the instructors [...] and enjoy engaging in discussions with them' (Chen, RI-I, Extract 17).

Despite encountering the same dificulties in seeking teacher feedback as Mai complained about, Chen remained undeterred and chose to seek more teacher feedback. Her FSB was more strategically crafted, nurturing a favourable feedback ecology through a careful selection of fedback sources and the deployment of an inquiry strategy. She made full preparations before tutorials by proposing multiple tentative solutions to the issues in her esays, rather than raising open-ended questions. For example, she explained in Extract 18 that she brought two different verions of an essay outine for the teacher to choose the better one. This is the main strategy with which Chen managed to secure more explicit, useable teacher feedback.

"I brought two outlines to Instructor C. She said the second version can answer the research question bettr (Chen, RI-I Extract 18)

Chen's strategic FSB is also reflected in her initiative to seek feedback on the same assignment from multiple instructors, encompassing both academic language tutors and course instructors, as she described in Extract 19.

"I showed my outline of Language Awarenes assgnment to the academic witing tuo. She paid more atention to the structure but did not give me suggestions on the content After reorganising thestructure, showed the outline to two course instructors. Instructor C [the course convenor of Language Awareness said thestructure is fine but the argument should be more focused. Instructor D [a module instructor of Language Awareness] reminded me of linking my argument with the context (Chen, RI-I, Extract 19, emphasis added)

By eliciting feedack from multiple instructors, Chen was able to validate her outline structure and identify remaining issues in her argumentation. This process broadened Chen's understanding of how to construct a strong and coherent argument.

4.2.2. Seeking affordances by navigating seemingly unjustified feedback Some of the feedback that Chen elicited, however, appeared unjustified and confusing. When drafting the SLA assgnment, Chen was uncertain about the structure of a conclusion and decided to emulate the moves in a leading scholar's article.

"Since I've no idea how to conclude an essay, I followed the structure of an article in a top journal, by including some practical implications in my conclusion' (Chen, RI-I, Extract 20).

However, in Extract 21, Chen reported that this emulation was criticised by Instructor B:

"When I asked Instructor B [the SLA course convenor] in the Q&A session whether I could wrap up the conclusion with some teaching suggestions, he disapproved but never explained why not. The article I read provided pedagogical implications. So, I thought teaching suggestions ought to be included (Chen, RI-I, Extract 21).

The course convenor's negative feedback did not make sense to Chen, driving her to see clarifications elsewhere. Chen consulted vith Instructor A (one of SLA course instructors) in atutorial, who modelled how to approach a writing task. Chen reported that nstructor A started with a close reading of all essay prompts:

"He checked the five assignments' instruction and read my essay' (Chen, RI-II, Extract 22).

Two assignment prompts are exemplified in Extract 23 and Extract 24.

"... Based on your personal experience of learning or tching a second/foreig language ., reflect on th 2 learning process and discuss those individual diferences which you think played the most significant role in facilitating the learning of the target language" (SLA assignment prompt, Extract 23).

"... onider the isue f linguistic prudice anddisussthe implications for the policy andr practice of English language taching in your chosen context' (LA assignment prompt, Extract 24).

According to Chen's interview (see Extract 25), Instructor A emphasised the importance of deciphering requirements implied in essay prompts.

"He said that I didn't have to writ suggestions, as the SLA assignment does not explitly requre me to do so. Then he showed me the Language wareness ssignment requirement and said this topic asks you to discuss implications so you need to write some" (Chen, RIII, Extract 25).

His modelling, combined with explicit instruction, made Chen aware of (a) genre differences between journal articles and course essays, and (b) varied requirements across essays, as manifested in Extract 26.

"nitiall, I thought th ublishd rticles are f good quait, so ing ther tces shuld e safe. ow, I know ae to refuly interpret assignment requirements" (Chen, RI-II, Extract 26).

In addition to fostering her feedback literacy, Instructor A's explanations for Instructor B's unconvincing feedback also afforded Chen a richer, more supportive feedback ecology in which she was able to construct meaningful connections with other agents and artefacts (in this case, Instructor B, teacher feedback, essay drafts, and published articles).

Moreover, this experience enabled Chen to sustain her appreciation of teacher feedback in general, atrbuting seemingly unusable indirect feedback to the contextual constraints rather than teachers' incompetence or poor work ethic, as seen in Extract 27.

"The instructors clearly know what I'm confused about. They can diagnose what isincorrct or redundant in my draft, but wouldn't explicitl tllme wh is excly need because the essays are to e asesed. So, I ned  reconsider h issus onmy ow. ete is brevity, the tutorial is very rewarding' (Chen, RI-II, Extract 27).

It is not uncommon that international students find teacher feedback confusing or contradictory (Anderson, 2021; F. Li & Han, 2022, 2023; Seror, 2008; J. hou et al., 2023), but Extract 27 suggests that Chen became aware of the potential ethical dilemmas that instructor faced, due to their dual role as both feedback providers and asessors. This nuanced, contextualised understanding of feedback and the responsibilities of both parties indicated growth in her feedback literacy.

Overall Chens strategic use of inquiry to seek feedback from multiple instructors enabled asupportive and nourishing feedback ecology, which incorporates diverse insights from different sources and meaningful connections between multiple agents and artfacts. Chen's fedback literacy also grew in this process, manifested in a more nuanced understanding of the teacher's dual role in the local assessment feedback context, and of her writing tasks, such as genre differences and varied requirements across asignments.

# 5. Discussion

Although researchers have not yet reached a consensus on whether FSB is an embedded component (Molloy et al., 2020) or an indicator of student feedback iteracy (Carles, 2022), the current multiple case study revealed that several dimensions of feedback literacy can evolve in students' self-initiated feedback-seeking journey.

The present findings support the claims made by Carles (2022), Winstone et al. (2017), as wellas T. Zhang and Mao (2023), demonstrating that both participants grew more appreciative of the feedback source they relied on (per feedback for Mai and teacher feedback for Chen). The two students silfull navigated and experimented with FSB strategies to address their own feedback needs either through requesting explicit feedback, i., inquiry (Lenknecht et al, 2019), or observing and reflecting on per dicussion and feedback given to others, ie., monitoring (Ohta, 200). They were also more able to sek, interpret, and evaluate cues from external sources to generate internal feedack and mobilise subsequent actions. Complementing the evidence of students increasingly positive dispositions and capabilities toselect, obtain, and evaluate feedack sources (Han & Xu, 2020; T. Zhang & Ma0, 2023) and building upon findings from Zhan (2021) and J. Zhou et al. (2023) regarding university students' feedback-seeking actions, the current study reveals the growth of Mai and Chen's knowledge about genre diffrences and teachers' multiple and even conflcting roles in assessment, which also informed their engagement with the sought feedback.

Underlying the overall growth in student feedback literacy, however, was unbalanced development cross dimensions of feedack literacy as reported in studies such as Han and Xu (2020) and Hoo et al.(2022). Extending this line of research, the current study uncovers that such alack of balance can occur between students' appreciation, capacity, and knowlege to us fedback from different sources. Itis understandable that intial frustration in seeking feedback from a particular source (g, teacher feedback in Mai's case) easily discourages a studen from seeking more feedback from the same source and may redirect him or her to an altenative e.g, peer feedback). This aligns with Rovagnati et al. (2022)'s findings that negative feedack-seeking experiences can shake students confidence in seeking future feedback. Despite her growing confidence in seeking and using peer feedbac, as well as her deepening understanding of teacher feedback, criteria, and expectations, Mai never returned to teachers for extra feedback or validation. That is, only part of her feedback literacy was extended. Her dispositions and capacitie to elct teacher feedback barely changed. imilarly, since Chen never reported approaching peers for fedback, it is questionable how competent she had become in eliciting, under. standing, and using feedback from sources other than teachers.

While previous reearch has shown the variations acros dimensions of student feedback literacy, as well as the varied growth of student fedback literacy along each dimension, our findings enrich this understanding by uncovering similar variations across feedback sources (e.g., teacher feedback and peer feedback). That i, not only may individual students' literacy in the use of teacher feedback and per feedback differ at the intil tag, the subsequent development f their literacy ofedack from theesources can also vary. Such disparities may become particularly pronounced and perpetuated in self-initiated feedback-seeking setigs, since students are free to choose feedback sources. If students find that their current FSB is adequat for completing academic tasks, they may become less motivated to make changes to develop their literacy of feedback from alternative sources.

The second research question investigates how FS influences feedback ecology, or in ecological terms, all-encompassing feedback contexts constituted by interconnected agents (eg, teachers, pers, and students), artefacts (eg, feedback, prompts, exemplars journal articles, emails, and social media) and physical space. Resonating with Bronfenbrenner's (1979) argument for reciprocal accommodation between people and their context, Mai and Chen's feedback-seeking actions showcase the very proces of navigating and adjusting to their feedback ecologies that started with limited affordances ready for immediate use. The affordances that they graduall accessed through SB manifested how the evolving feedback ecologies accommodate individual students with different profile of feedack iteracy. he changes of their feedack ologies wert ony in the mmediat lar of the feack contxs, but also occurred in a more remote layer, i.e., indirect access to feedback resources.

Echoing Chong (2021), we found that agents and artefacts in the immediate layers of our participants'fedback ecologies may differ. Both Mai and Chen selected favoured feedback interactants (either teacher or peers) and constructed direct connections with them through inquiry, but reduced interactions with altenative feedack providers. As Mai became more trusting, open, and critical in seeking per feedack, reflecting Yang and Carless (2013) characterisation ofeffectie learners, her positity was recirocated by peers, who voluntarily shared feedback artefacts that Mai would have hardly accessed otherwise, eg,instructors emails to other students. In Chen's case, by proposing multipl outlines for teachers to choose, she precluded ambiguous responses and strategically mandated the teachers totalor their feedback for her. his stratey resonates with the findings of de Kleijn et al. (2015), who suggest that students can articulate their leaning neds to help supervisors personalise thir fdack. As she constructed stronger connections to the teachers, Chen obtained aces to greater affordances that other students might not encounter, such as Instructor A's modelling of how to interpret essay prompts and requirements.

The more remote layer of feedback ecology can also be enriched through FSB, as illustrated by Mai's case. Through observing, rather than directly participating in peers online discussion of teacher feedack, the pers that she was not familiar with and would not consult with in person became her indirect" fedback interactants, whose discusson inspired her to pursue unresolved problems further by gleaning, analysing, and reflecting on multiple feedback artefacts at her disposal.

# 6. Conclusion

Informed by an ecological perspective on language learning, the current study revealed that individual students' FSB enhanced their feedback literacy, albeit unevenly, and enriched their feedback cology by constructing connections with different agents and accessing abundant afordances The study contributes t FSB scholarship by making progress i adressing the theoretical dissonance between FSB research, which has largely been psychologically oriented, and feedback literacy research informed by more socially oriented perspectives. The ecological acount of the focal students feedack-seeking experiences also allowed for a holistic understanding of the close and mutual interactions between learners and affordances embedded in disciplinary academic writing context, especially often taken-for-granted influences of FsB on feedback literacy and on feedback ecology.

The current ecological accounts of feedback-seeking experiences, in combination with prior research revealing the contextual influences on students elictation and use of feedback (J. Zhou et al., 2023), can enrich understanding of the contextualised nature of

FSB. More broadly, by highlighting the mutual and dynamic influences betwen individuals, fedback-related artefacts, physical/virtual settings, and social-psychological atmosphere, this study joins Nieminen and Carles (2022) in embracing the social and dialogical paradigm of feedback and challenging the deficit model of feedback literacy and FSB.

As a close-up multiple case study, the current investigation has a few imitations to be acknowledged. Despite the varied FSB observed in the data, the results were drawn from only two focal students' feedback experiences in an MA TEsOL programme in a UK university and should not be hastily generalised to other groups of students and other disciplines. Since the participants were selected because of their proactivity in seeking feedback, their heavy use of inquiry strategies as opposed to monitoring strategies may not reflect other intenational students fedback-seeking practice. In addition, although we stried to collect documents and artefacts that could triangulate with the self-reported data, interviews were still the major data source.

Despite these limitations, the current indings suggest that explicit instruction on feedback-seeking strategies should be incorporated into EAP writing instruction, L2 writing instruction, and even discipline-specific subject-matter courses,to better prepare students for navigating and enriching their eedback ecologies and thereby thriving as writers. Preparatory EAP writing courses should advise first-year inteational students to actively engage with local teachers and immerse thmselves in the host institutions feedack and academic writing culture o as to understand itsnorms and expectations. Since students may experience difficulties in formulating effective questions to solicit feedback, EAP teachers, 2 writing teacher, as well as subject-matter course teachers should guide and support students in selecting and applying multipl feedback-seeking strategies across contexts. Aditionaly, fostering discussions with peers who have greater familiarity with the host education system can facilitatea smoother academic transition and a more comprehensive grasp of the feedback process for international students and other novice academic writers. Given the unbalanced development of our participants fedback literacy, teachers are advised to help students to recognise and appreciate a wider array of feedback sources. However, we belie that students should have the ight to decide from which sources) they elicit feedback as long as they can resolve their writing difficulties and meet their learning objectives effectively.

Building on the current study, fuure reearch can examine B and its influence on feedack literacy delopment across inguistic, educational, and socio-cultural contexts. Moreover, studies can explore ways in which teachers can effectively support students FSB including examining the learning effects of explicit instruction about FSB strategies or creating a supportive feedback culture in the classrom. The inclusion of students from other disciplines and cultural groups can enrich the perspectives on the phenomenon under research. Longitudinal studies are also recommended to explore long-term effects of FS strategies on the development of student feedback literacy and students' EAP writing competence.
