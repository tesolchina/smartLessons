# ABSTRACT

Sound symbolism, the iconic link between speech sounds and meanings, helps children’s verb learning. In sound symbolically rich languages such as Turkish, hearing sound symbolic words might facilitate early verb learning and later language-specific expressions of motion events, by providing an easier way to map verbs onto events. These links could be much stronger for children who had difficulties in word-referent mapping (e.g., preterm children). The current study examined the association of Turkish-speaking parents’ sound symbolic input at 20 months with children’s concurrent verb knowledge and later motion event descriptions at 48 months. Ninety-one parent-infant dyads $( M \mathsf { a g e } = 1 9 . 9 2$ months, $S D = 1 . 3 8$ ; 41 preterms) were observed at 20 months, where we measured sound symbolic input and verb knowledge. Sixty-four of these dyads participated in a motion event description task at 48 months (25 preterms, Mage $= 4 8 . 7 9$ months, $\mathsf { S D } = 1 . 6 8 )$ , where we coded how children use path (the trajectory of motion) and manner (how an action is performed) of a motion. Results from the robust regression models suggested that for preterm children, parents’ sound symbolic input used in adverb forms was positively and concurrently related to children’s verb knowledge. Only for full-term children, sound symbolic input (used as adverbs) predicted full-term children’s use of both path and manner information in their descriptions at 48 months. Lack of replication of these findings with outlier-removed analyses could only suggest a trend toward the differential contributions of sound symbolic input in different child populations and the importance of sentential cues in sound symbolic input in verb learning.

# 1. Introduction

Sound symbolism, the similarity between speech sounds and meanings, provides children with an insight that words refer to something in the environment (Imai & Kita 2014). For example, words like boom and crash are directly related to their referents’ perceptual characteristics (i.e., the sound of an explosion and the sound of violent breaking). This perceptual similarity can also enhance verb learning (Imai & Childers 2020) and may influence how children express motion events by reconciling the difficulty of mapping verbs onto event components (i.e., path and manner of motion) (Göksun et al. 2010, 2017) Additionally, sound symbolic words are integral to parent–child interactions (Fernald & Morikawa 1993, Motamedi et al. 2021) and associated with children’s vocabulary knowledge (Kızıldere et al. 2022). Moreover, children attend to sentential cues when learning new word meanings (e.g., Fisher et al. 2010). For example, parents might refer to manner of motion in adverbs in sentences, and these manner words could be sound symbolic (e.g., Kız zıplayarak gitti – The girl went jumpingly). Such uses might make detection of sentential cues easier for children. Therefore, sound symbolic input and how sound symbolic words are incorporated in sentences could aid children’s verb learning.

Furthermore, sound symbolic input might also benefit children who have particular difficulty mapping words onto referents, such as preterm children whose gestational age is lower than 37 weeks (e.g., Brósch-Fohraheim et al. 2019, Sansavini et al. 2010). Considering the benefits of sound symbolism in word-referent mapping process, sound symbolic input might provide an additional support mechanism for word-referent mapping (i.e., verb-manner of motion), particularly for preterm children. The present study investigates the relation between Turkish parents’ sound symbolic input at 20 months and children’s concurrent verb knowledge and later description of motion events at 48 months, focusing on the specific aspects of sound symbolic input and the moderating role of children’s neonatal condition (i.e., being born preterm or full-term).

# 1.1. Sound symbolism and language development

Sound symbolism refers to the correspondence between words’ acoustic properties and their referents’ acoustic (i.e., onomatopoeia) or any other physical features (i.e., ideophones) (Lockwood & Dingemanse 2015). In this study, we use sound symbolism as an umbrella term, including both onomatopoeia and ideophones. Sound symbolism is present in many languages. We focus on sound symbolism in Turkish, where sound symbolic word roots can be used in different forms using suffixes (Demircan 1996, Ido 1999, Jendraschek 2001). For example, the word root pat refers to an object hitting a surface with a loud sound. Suffixes such as -la, -ır (patla ‘to explode’, patır ‘heavily hitting to a surface’), allow speakers to use sound symbolic words more frequently and diversely in different linguistic units (Kızıldere et al. 2022), providing different sentential cues. Sound symbolism in Turkish is also used to amplify verb meaning in adverbial forms such as pat pat yürümek (walking pat pat ‘clomping’; Demircan 1996, Jendraschek 2001).

The sound symbolism bootstrapping hypothesis asserts that sound symbolism helps children’s language development by facilitating children’s understanding of referentiality and easing the mapping of the words onto their referents due to its iconic properties (Imai & Kita 2014). For example, studies using the kiki-bouba (e.g., takate-maluma, kipi-moma) paradigm support this hypothesis, showing how children associate kiki with spiky and bouba with round objects (Miyazaki et al. 2013, Fort et al. 2018). Similarly, sound symbolic verbs are also easier to learn compared to nonsound symbolic verbs (Imai et al. 2008, Kantartzis et al. 2011, Motamedi et al. 2021, Yoshida 2012). For example, English-learning 3-year-olds, who heard novel sound symbolic verbs that were phonetically and morphologically similar to the sound symbolic words in Japanese for the corresponding motion (e.g., nosunosu for walking slowly, batobato for walking with energetically with large movements), learned the verbs better than their counterparts who heard these sound symbolic words for mismatching motions (Kantartzis et al. 2011). Furthermore, children learning sound symbolically rich languages (e.g., Turkish and Japanese), spontaneously use sound symbolic words when they describe motion events (Allen et al. 2007). Thus, learning sound symbolic labels are easier than nonsound symbolic ones for both objects and motion, and children can use such words spontaneously.

Despite the benefits of sound symbolism, to what extent sound symbolism contributes to language learning is not very-well known. Nielsen & Dingemanse (2021) argued that the previous empirical studies on sound symbolism could only suggest the ease of learning sound symbolic words due to their iconicity and the accumulated evidence was not enough to argue about the advantage for the acquisition of nonsound symbolic words. However, focusing on how sound symbolism is naturally used in a language might reveal associations with specific language outcomes that are nonsound symbolic. For example, in Turkish, sound symbolic words mainly amplify verb meaning by expressing how an action happens (i.e., manner of motion; Jendraschek 2001). Thus, sound symbolism in Turkish might help children learn action-related language (i.e., verbs and motion event descriptions).

Learning verbs is more complex than learning nouns (Gentner 1982, Gentner & Boroditsky 2001) because it requires discrimination and categorization of event components such as path (i.e., the direction of an action), and manner (i.e., how an action is performed; Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun 2019; Göksun et al. 2010; Konishi et al. 2016; Pruden et al. 2012, 2013). By 15 months of age, infants can discriminate and categorize both path and manner (Pruden et al. 2012,2013; Pulverman et al. 2008), with considerable individual differences that predict children’s later verb knowledge and motion event lexicalization (Konishi et al. 2016, Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun 2019). Infants who discriminate event components earlier might start learning how their language specifically encodes event components earlier, enhancing the verb learning process (Göksun et al. 2010, 2017).

The role of sound symbolism, as a perceptual cue, could be more nuanced in early verb learning since perceptual cues are integral to language development (Hollich et al. 2000). Particularly, children at around 20 months can benefit from perceptual cues more than social and linguistic cues in verb learning (Brandone et al. 2007, Maguire et al. 2006). Around these ages, one major challenge in verb learning across different languages is that children prefer to map a novel verb onto the path of a motion rather than manner (i.e., Japanese, English, Spanish; Maguire et al. 2010). However, hearing sound symbolic words, which, in Turkish, tend to refer to manner of motion, could also make the manner perceptually salient similar to the path of motion, potentially leading to an earlier finer-grained categorization of path and manner.

Early event perception could also facilitate later verb learning processes (i.e., motion event descriptions at 4 years). Languages differ based on how they predominantly encode manner and path in a sentence. Satellite-framed languages (e.g., English) express manner in the main verb and path in a prepositional phrase as opposed to verb-framed languages (e.g., Turkish, Japanese, French), expressing path in the main verb and manner in a subordinate clause (Talmy 1985, 2000). For example, Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun (2019) showed that Turkish-learning 14-month-olds who discriminated motion event components better used more path information in their motion event descriptions two years later. Despite the salience of path information in these languages, a complete motion event description should include both path and manner information. Children learning verb-framed languages use such combinations later than their counterparts learning satellite-framed languages, potentially due to the difficulty of expressing manner as a subordinate clause and the ease of expressing path information (Allen et al. 2007, Hickmann et al. 2009, Talmy 2000).

Sound symbolism can also be related to motion event descriptions that are not necessarily sound symbolic. For example, in Turkish, sound symbolic words mainly resemble their referent’s manner of motion, making the mapping of manners onto words easier. If children are consistently exposed to different sound symbolic words referring to manner of motion, this might make the manner more salient, helping children discriminate manners. Early discrimination of event components might aid children in learning language-specific expressions of motion earlier (Göksun et al. 2017). Thus, it could increase the likelihood of using language-specific motion descriptions (e.g., the use of path information in Turkish; Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun 2019). Furthermore, the iconicity of sound symbolic manner words might make manner more salient for children, easing the manner verb learning process. Since it is relatively harder to map manner words early in development (Maguire et al. 2010), early developed sensitivity to manner might make manner of motion as salient as path of motion. Therefore, the integration of path and manner in a sentence could become easier for children, increasing the use of path and manner information together.

In sum, sound symbolism, by providing an iconic link between words and referents, helps children learn sound symbolic words (Imai & Kita 2014). However, whether this advantage extends to learning nonsound symbolic language is still an open question (Nielsen & Dingemanse 2021). We proposed that sound symbolism might facilitate verb learning (i.e., verb knowledge at 20 months and motion event descriptions at 48 months) by fostering event component discrimination and mapping words onto event components. Therefore, the current study focuses both on the quantity and quality of parental sound symbolic input and their relation to verb learning.

# 1.2. Parental sound symbolic input and language development

The proportion of parents’ sound symbolic word use varies across languages (e.g., Jo & Ko 2018, Kızıldere et al. 2022, Perry et al. 2018) and across children’s age (Jo & Ko 2018, Kızıldere et al. 2022, Motamedi et al. 2021, Schelhaas 2018). For example, Japanese-speaking parents use more sound symbolic words to their 6- to-19-month-olds when labeling objects (Fernald & Morikawa 1993) and their 3-year-olds when explaining an action (Yoshida 2012) than their English-speaking counterparts do. In general, sound symbolic words are less frequently used in Indo-European languages (Ota et al. 2018, Schelhaas 2018). For example, Swedishspeaking parents provided, on average, 1.5 sound symbolic words per minute (Schelhaas 2018), whereas Turkish-speaking parents used six sound symbolic words per minute to their 12- to 16-month-olds (Kızıldere et al. 2022). Furthermore, sound symbolic input displayed a trend to decrease towards 20 months in Swedish (e.g., around 1 word per minute; Schelhaas 2018) and Turkish (e.g., around 4 words per minute; Kızıldere et al. 2022). Younger infants received sound symbolic input more frequently, potentially due to its benefits in early language development (Kızıldere et al. 2022).

A few studies investigated the association between the frequency of parents’ sound symbolic word use and children’s vocabulary development, yet none of them found a relation between the two (Asmaa 2017, Hanson 2019, Ota et al. 2018; Schelhaas 2018). However, the lack of association could be due to the small sample sizes and lack of variability in sound symbolic input. Accommodating these limitations, Kızıldere et al. (2022) found that the number of sound symbolic words parents used was negatively associated with 20-month-olds’ vocabulary knowledge, meaning that sound symbolic input was provided for children with lower vocabulary knowledge. Going beyond input quantity, Kızıldere et al. (2022) also showed that input quality (i.e., sound symbolic word diversity) was positively associated with Turkish-learning 14-month-olds’ vocabulary knowledge. Thus, investigating the quality of sound symbolic input could reveal further insights into infants’ vocabulary development. Notably, input quality is not only restricted to how diverse sound symbolic words are used. For example, the iconicity of sound symbolic words provides clear word-referent relations (Perniss et al. 2010), thus, using these sound symbolic words in certain occasions (i.e., talking about motion) in certain roles in sentences (i.e., adverbs) could make learning easier for certain cases (i.e., verb learning). Hence, a thorough analysis of sound symbolic input quality would lend opportunities to observe the benefits of sound symbolism more comprehensively.

The linguistic unit in which parents use sound symbolic words can also support vocabulary development. In Turkish, the manner of motion is generally expressed in adverbial clauses (AktanErciyes et al. 2022, Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun 2019) and sound symbolic words mainly express how an action is performed or happens (i.e., manner of motion, Demircan 1996). Importantly, if parents use sound symbolic words in adverbial roles in sentences (i.e., language-specific use), children can get more familiar to hearing salient manner words (i.e., sound symbolic words) in specific roles in sentences. In other words, the constant exposure to sound symbolic manner adverbs might make it clear for children that manner words are used in adverbial forms. Thus, this process might help children use sentential cues to interpret manner words (e.g., kız zıp zıp gitti ‘the girl went jumpingly’). Furthermore, understanding the linguistic unit of the manner words could restrict the possibility of mapping path words (e.g., after mapping zıp zıp to jumping, the possible mapping for gitti would be for the concept of going). Thus, language-specific use of sound symbolism may provide insight into the identification of typical linguistic units in which event components are expressed in a language, making sentential cues available for children in verb-referent mapping.

In sum, by providing a salient word-referent correspondence, parental sound symbolic input can facilitate verb learning and motion event descriptions. However, examining this relation requires a careful analysis of parental sound symbolic input. For example, language-specific use of sound symbolism in sentences could provide context to interpret word meanings. Following these considerations, the first aim of this study is to unravel the specific links between parents’ sound symbolic input to their 20-month-olds, children’s concurrent verb knowledge, and motion event descriptions at 48 months.

# 1.3. Sound symbolic input and neonatal condition

Experimental and observational studies, so far, have shown the benefits of sound symbolism on language development only for typically developing children (e.g., Imai et al. 2008, Kızıldere et al. 2022) but not for children who are at risk of language delays. One such group is children who are born preterm (PT; gestational age ${ < } 3 7$ weeks; Brósch-Fohraheim et al. 2019, Sansavini et al. 2010). Preterm children are exposed to different biological and environmental factors such as environmental overstimulation (Sansavini et al. 2011) and sometimes worsened parent–child interactions due to the negative experiences (e.g., stress) during pregnancy and after birth (Coppola et al. 2007). Resulting from these differences, PT children score lower than their full-term (FT) counterparts in several language measures, including speech perception, vocabulary, processing efficiency, and grammar at different ages (Bosch 2011, Foster-Cohen et al. 2007, Guarini et al. 2009, Loi, Marchman, et al. 2017, van Noort-van der Spek et al. 2012). The long-lasting differences on language skills could be due to cascading effects of some specific skill sets PT children possibly acquire later than FT children during early language learning (Iverson 2021, Karmiloff-Smith 1998).

One such skill related to verb learning is word-referent mapping, in which PT infants lag behind their FT counterparts (Gogate 2020, Onario & Morgan 2016), leading PT infants to potentially require more scaffolding. PT children display difficulties in mapping syllables to objects (Gogate et al. 2014). Furthermore, mapping words onto manner of motion, in and of itself, is a difficult process even for FT children (Maguire et al. 2010), beyond the general difficulty PT children have in word-referent mapping. Thus, sound symbolic words might ease the process of mapping words (i.e., verbs) onto referents (event components), especially for PT children. Therefore, these challenges that PT children face might lead them to leverage further support from sound symbolic input compared to their FT peers.

Sound symbolic input might provide an additional support for PT infants than FT infants in two ways. First, as PT children are at risk of language delay, the room for improvement is wider than the ones without this risk. To provide that improvement, parents might adjust their language input according to their PT children’s language skills. Previous studies showed that parents, regardless of the neonatal status of their children, tailored their language input according to their children’s needs (Chapman 2000, Huttenlocher et al. 2010, van Dijk et al. 2013, Yurovsky 2018). Sound symbolic input is also used more frequently when children do not know a specific word (Motamedi et al. 2021) or when their expressive vocabulary is low (Kızıldere et al. 2022). Such a reciprocal process, where parents change their input considering their children’s language skills, can also be observed in children with language delays (e.g., autism; Fusaroli et al. 2019). Thus, parents might adjust their language input by using more sound symbolic input for their PT children to accommodate the language delay in their children.

Second, PT children might be more sensitive to parental sound symbolic input even if they have comparable language skills and parental sound symbolic input with FT children. Early birth abruptly changes the environment from uterus, where rapid brain development during typical pregnancy occurs, to outside the womb (Penn et al. 2016). Thus, PT children interact with the environment when their brain has high plasticity (DeMaster et al. 2019). Therefore, PT infants’ brains might be highly influenced by negative and positive environmental factors (Belsky 2016) such as maternal distress and parenting quality (Gueron-Sela et al. 2015, Poehlmann et al. 2011). In terms of language input, support for this argument is mixed. Although the association between parental input and child language outcomes is not moderated by PT birth in some studies (Adams et al. 2018, Loi, Vaca, et al. 2017), PT children benefit more from parental pointing gestures in expressive vocabulary development (Doğan et al. under review). In relation to sound symbolism, experiencing frequent sound symbolic input might protect PT children against the negative cascading effects of the difficulties they face in mapping words to referents. Therefore, sound symbolic input might be more critical for PT children in mapping verbs onto events.

# 1.4. Present study

The present study investigates whether parental sound symbolic input to Turkish-learning PT and FT 20-month-olds is associated with their concurrent verb knowledge and later motion event descriptions at 48 months. Both sound symbolic input and verb knowledge are expected to show variation at 20 months when early verb learning starts (e.g., Aksu-Koç et al. 2019) and sound symbolic input is still observable (e.g., Kızıldere et al. 2022). In this study, we also focus on how sound symbolic input is presented (i.e., noun, adjective, verb, adverb, and auxiliary verb), referring to actions.

We ask three main research questions: (1) Is parental sound symbolic input quantity and quality associated with children’s concurrent verb knowledge? Regarding the quantity, we expect that the number of parental sound symbolic words (i.e., tokens) will be positively associated with children’s verb knowledge. Regarding the quality, we expect that using sound symbolic words as adverbs will be positively related to children’s concurrent verb knowledge if being exposed to such adverbs familiarizes children to how motion event components are typically expressed in language. (2) Is parental sound symbolic input associated with children’s motion event descriptions at 48 months? We predict that sound symbolic input quantity and quality will predict some aspect(s) of children’s motion event descriptions. However, we have two competing hypotheses regarding the aspects of descriptions to be related to parents’ input. If sound symbolic words provide an easy and salient way to express and focus on manner of motion, we expect a positive link between children’s use of both event components in their explanations. Alternatively, if hearing sound symbolic words familiarize children to how motion is typically expressed in language, we expect a positive link with children’s use of path information in the events since Turkish is a path-focused language. (3) Are the links between sound symbolic input, children’s verb knowledge, and motion event descriptions moderated by children’s neonatal condition (PT or FT)? We expect that the links are stronger for preterm children since they can be potentially more sensitive to the parental input quality (DeMaster et al. 2019).

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Participants

This study was part of a longitudinal study investigating Turkish-learning PT and FT children’s language and cognitive development. For this study, the samples from the second (20-month-olds; Time-1 of the current study) and fourth wave (48-month-olds; Time-2 of the current study) were used. Ninety-seven 20-month-olds and their parents were recruited in the second wave. Participants who were simultaneously bilingual $( \mathtt { n } = 2 )$ , lacked measures regarding sound symbolic input $( \mathbf { n } = 2 )$ and verb knowledge $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 \right)$ were excluded. Thus, the final sample at Time-1 consisted of 91 parent-child dyads (46 girls, 45 boys, $\mathrm { M a g e } = 1 9 . 9 2$ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 3 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) 50 of which were $\mathrm { F T } ^ { 1 }$ $\mathrm { ^ M a g e } = 2 0 . 1 7$ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 2 9 ,$ ) and 41 of which were PT $( \mathrm { M a g e } = 1 9 . 6 1 $ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 4 4 \AA ,$ ). We considered children who were born before 37 weeks as PT (Brósch-Fohraheim et al. 2019) and used corrected age (i.e., age if they were born FT) in our analyses. Sixty-nine of these parent–child dyads participated in the study when children were 48 months old. Participants who lacked measures regarding motion event descriptions $\mathrm { ( n = 4 ) }$ ), and who did not complete more than half of the trials in the motion event description task $\mathbf { \tau } ( \mathbf { n } = 1 \mathbf { \dot { \tau } } )$ ) were excluded. Thus, the final sample at Time-2 consisted of 64 parent–child dyads (32 girls, 32 boys, $\mathrm { M a g e } = 4 8 . 7 9$ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 6 8 { } _ { , }$ ), 34 of which were FT $( \mathrm { M a g e } = 4 8 . 8 0 $ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 6 9 _ { , }$ ) and 30 of which were PT $\mathrm { \Delta ( M a g e = 4 8 . 7 8 }$ months, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 4 4 )$ . PT children’s age was corrected at both time points. The number of girls and boys did not differ across PT and FT children at both Time-1 $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 1 , \ \mathrm { N } = 9 1 ) = 1 . 0 0$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 7 6 0 \mathrm { \ : ) }$ ) and Time-2 $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 1 , \mathrm { N } = 6 4 ) = . 0 9$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 3 1 6 )$ All parents signed a written consent form at the first session and an online form at the second session. The project was approved by Koç University’s Institutional Review Board with protocol number 2018.118. IRB3.083.

Our sample consisted of parent-child dyads with middle-to-high socioeconomic status. Regarding education level, $8 5 . 9 \%$ of the mothers and $8 3 . 3 \%$ of the fathers in our sample have at least a college degree. Regarding income, only 56 parents were willing to share their income. Among the respondents, $1 7 . 9 \%$ of participants had a monthly income less than ₺5000, $3 0 . 3 \%$ of them between ₺5000 and ₺10000, and $5 1 . 8 \%$ of the parents had an income above ₺10000. PT children’s mothers had lower education levels than FT children children’s mothers did $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 2 , \mathrm { N } = 8 5 ) = 6 . 6 1$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 0 3 7 ,$ ), yet paternal education $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 2 , \ N = 8 4 ) = 4 . 5 9$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 1 0 1 ,$ ) and monthly income did not differ according to children’s neonatal condition $\left( \mathrm { t } ( 3 1 . 5 ) = - . 1 3 7 \right)$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 8 9 2 ^ { \cdot }$ ). Participants who only participated at 20 months were not significantly different than the ones who participated at both 20 months and 48 months in terms of maternal education, $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 2 , \ N = 8 5 ) =$ .191, $\mathfrak { p } = . 9 0 9 )$ , paternal education2 $( \chi ^ { 2 } ( 2 , \ : \mathrm { N } = 8 4 ) = 3 . 1 4 ,$ p $= . 2 0 8 )$ , and monthly income $( \mathrm { t } ( 5 4 ) = - . 6 1 0$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 5 4 4 )$ .

# 2.2. Materials and measures

# 2.2.1. Time-1

Parental sound symbolic input was measured by parents’ language during a 10-minute free play session. To eliminate the differences in sound symbolic input due to the variability in the play session duration $\mathbf { M } = 9 . 8 3$ minutes, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 9 2$ minutes), we used sound symbolic input per minute in our analyses. The materials used (i.e., two animal dolls, two short books, an abacus, four cubes, a ball, and a play mat) in this study were the same as the ones used in the study of Kızıldere et al. (2022). The play sessions were videotaped for further transcription and coding. To eliminate the potential confounding effect of parents’ overall language use, we calculated parents’ number of utterances during the play sessions. The sound symbolic input coding details are provided under the Transcription and Coding section.

Children’s verb knowledge at 20 months was assessed by the Turkish adaptation of MacArthurBates CDI (Fenson et al. 2000), namely the Turkish Communicative Development Inventory (TCDI; Aksu-Koç et al. 2019). TCDI-II is recommended for 16- to 36-month-olds (Aksu-Koç et al. 2019) and consists of 711 vocabulary items, from which parents indicate whether their children can understand and produce listed vocabulary (i.e., expressive vocabulary). Among the 711 items, only 146 items measure children’s knowledge of verbs, which we focused on in the current study. Among these 146 items, only 3 of them were sound symbolic (i.e., bağır ‘to shout’, çağır ‘to call’, and patla ‘to explode’).

# 2.2.2. Time-2

Children’s motion event descriptions were investigated by ten videos in which an agent moved in certain directions (i.e., path) with different styles (i.e., manner). These videos depicted a woman’s actions, lasting approximately 4 seconds in an outdoor or indoor area and were selected from stimuli set used in another study (Aktan-Erciyes et al. 2022). Selected motion events are listed in the Appendix. Among the selected ten motion events, children were likely to use sound symbolic manner words only in describing two videos (i.e., sahaya zıplayarak girmek ‘jump into court’ and zikzak yaparak ilerlemek ‘zigzag away’). Children were assigned to one of the two conditions that differed in order. The orders in two conditions were randomly determined. Children watched these videos in a virtual meeting using Zoom. Participants were expected to join the virtual meeting from a computer $\mathrm { ( n } = 5 4 ,$ ), yet some did not have access to a computer and were allowed to participate in the study from a tablet $\left( \mathtt { n } = 3 \right)$ or smartphone $( \mathbf { n } = 7 )$ .3 From this task, we coded how children used path and manner information in these motion event videos, whose details are provided under the Transcription and Coding section.

# 2.3. Procedure

# 2.3.1. Time-1

Parent–infant dyads participated in the study in either a lab environment at Koç University, Istanbul, or in a silent room in the facility of the Metin Sabancı Healthcare Center. Since this study is part of a larger project, the entire procedure lasted approximately one hour and fifteen minutes. Parents first signed the informed consent form and filled out the demographic form. The play session, which lasted 10 minutes, was the last activity in the session. The video recording of play sessions started after the researcher informed the parents about the play session and left the room. Parents were instructed to play with the provided toys as they would play at home without priming any behavior and informed that they could end the session before 10 minutes if they wanted. Upon completing the study session, parents filled out TCDI-II remotely and delivered the forms via e-mail. To compensate for participants’ transportation costs and participation, parents were provided ₺50, and infants were given a book as a gift.

# 2.3.2. Time-2

Parent–infant dyads were invited to two sessions of virtual meetings as part of a larger project. The second sessions were scheduled one week later than the first sessions $\mathbf { \chi } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { M } = 9 . 1 9$ days, $\mathrm { S D } = 5 . 7 8 $ days). Parents gave their consent to participate in the study via a survey developed in Qualtrics before the first session started. During the entire procedure, parents were informed that they could stay with their children if they wanted to. The parents who chose to stay with their children were asked not to intervene and correct their children’s performance.4 These instructions were provided in both first and the second session. For this study, we only used data from the motion event description task, which lasted around five minutes and was the first activity in the second session. Prior to starting the task, the experimenter told the children that they were going to watch ten videos showing different actions, which they would describe right after the video stopped. After watching each video, the experimenter asked what happened in the video. In case children did not answer the question, the experimenter repeated the question. If children were still nonresponsive, experimenter passed to the next trial. To compensate for their participation, e-gift cards worth ₺50 from Amazon Turkey were sent to the parents’ e-mail addresses.

# 2.4. Transcription and coding

# 2.4.1. Sound symbolic input at Time-1

Parents and children’s language use during the play session were transcribed using MS Excel. Each transcript started right after the experimenter left the room and ended either when the experimenter came in the room to inform the end of the session or when the parent–child dyad left the room before the experimenter came in. In between, parents and infants’ words and infants’ babbles were written by specifying the time in the recording and the speaker.

Parental sound symbolic input was coded based on the coding scheme from Kızıldere et al. (2022). The coding scheme was inserted into the transcription files. In the first column of the coding scheme, the sound symbolic word in the corresponding transcript was written in the same row. If more than one sound symbolic word was used in the speech transcribed in a specific cell, additional empty rows were inserted to code each sound symbolic word individually. From this column, we calculated the total number of sound symbolic words (i.e., Tokens). Next, the kind (sound source) of sound symbolic words was categorized according to the referent of the sound symbolic words (i.e., Action: hop, a circular movement; pat, object hitting a surface; Animal: woof woof, meow; Machine: choo choo, dızz, drilling; and Human: muah, kissing; hapşu, achoo). Since we examine the association with verb learning, we only focused on action sound symbolic words (i.e., the ones that resemble to the auditory or visual characteristics of an action) and disregarded the other sound symbolic words. The third column includes whether the sound symbolic word was incorporated in a sentence (Incorporated, Not Incorporated). If incorporated, we coded in which linguistic unit (noun, adjective, adverb, verb, auxiliary verb) that sound symbolic word was used in the next column. From this column, we calculated the number of sound symbolic words used as nouns (e.g., zıpzıpa bak ‘look at the jumping thing’), adjectives (e.g., zıpzıp topu gördün mü? ‘did you see the jumping ball’), adverbs (e.g., top zıplayarak gitti ‘the ball went jumpingly’), verbs (e.g., top zıpladı ‘the ball jumped’), and auxiliary verbs (e.g., top zıp yaptı ‘the ball jumped’; see Kızıldere et al. 2022 for other examples).

The main coding was completed by the first author. An assistant who was trained on coding the sound symbolic input coded $2 0 \%$ of the data to check reliability. We conducted ICC analyses for the sound symbolic input variables with a two-way random model with absolute agreement and single measures based on the criteria provided by Koo & Li (2016). The results indicated good reliability (.75 $< \mathrm { I C C } < . 9 0$ ; Koo & Li 2016) for all the sound symbolic input measures (all ICCs > .757, $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1 )$ .

# 2.4.2. Motion event descriptions at Time-2

Motion event descriptions were transcribed trial by trial in MS Excel. We transcribed children’s speech if it was relevant to the trial or not due to parental interference. For example, we would not transcribe this speech if a child talked about her toys irrelevant to the motion event or answered her parents’ question of how the girl moved or where she was moving to. Completed transcripts were checked and corrected by the first author before coding. Then, we coded motion event descriptions using the coding scheme from previous studies conducted with Turkish samples (Aktan-Erciyes et al. 2023, Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun 2019). Using MS Excel, we coded descriptions of the components used. A description can include Manner Only (kız zıpladı, the girl is jumping), Path Only (kız çıktı, the girl exited), or both (i.e., Path $^ +$ Manner, kız zıplayarak çıktı, the girl exited jumpingly). In the following columns, we also coded whether the description includes information regarding manner and path for each trial. The descriptions categorized as Manner Only and Path $^ +$ Manner were coded as Manner Any because they include manner information. The ones categorized as Path Only and Path $^ +$ Manner were coded as Path Any because they include manner information. Then, we calculated the proportion of $P a t h + M a n n e r ,$ and Path Any descriptions for further analysis.

The main coding was completed by the first author and the reliability coding was completed from $2 0 \%$ of the data (13 participants, 129 trials) by a trained research assistant. Reliability analysis was conducted by comparing whether the raters’ classifications of each description (Path Only, Manner Only, Path $^ +$ Manner, None) match by calculating Cohen’s kappa using kappa2 function from irr package (Gamer et al. 2012) in R 4.2.2 (R Core Team 2022). The results indicated a substantial agreement ( $. 6 1 <$ Cohen’s kappa $< . 8 0$ ; Landis & Koch 1977) between two coders (Cohen’s kappa $=$ .696, $z = 1 3 . 2 0$ , $\mathrm { p } < . 0 0 1 ,$ ). The main analyses were conducted after the disagreements in the trials were resolved.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Preliminary analyses at Time-1

We conducted preliminary analyses to determine whether PT and FT children differed in terms of the sound symbolic input they received and their verb knowledge. The results revealed no significant differences between PT and FT groups $\left( \mathrm { t } ( 8 9 ) < 1 . 1 2 \right.$ , $\mathrm { p } > . 2 6 8 )$ . Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for study variables in PT and FT children.

# 3.2. Concurrent relations between Time-1 sound symbolic input and verb knowledge

To examine the relation between sound symbolic input and child measures (i.e., expressive verb, percentage of Path Any descriptions, percentage of Path $^ +$ Manner descriptions), we conducted robust regression analyses in R using rlm function from the MASS library in R (Venables & Ripley 2002). By using the robust regression technique, the observations highly influential on the OLS model results were reweighted to have less influence, decreasing the bias resulting from the heteroskedasticity and outliers. The reported p-values for the estimates of the robust models were calculated using f.robftest function from sfsmisc library in R (Maechler 2018). In building the models, continuous control variables were not scaled, categorical control variables were dummy coded $\mathrm { P T } = 0$ , $\mathrm { F T } = 1$ ), and sound symbolic input variables were mean centered.

a Expressive verb was scored out of 146. b Sound symbolic input was reported as input per minute.

We initially investigated the concurrent association between sound symbolic input and children’s verb knowledge at 20 months. Our control variables in Models 1 and 2 were children’s age, neonatal condition, and total words uttered by parents. Beyond control variables, we included sound symbolic input variables in different models: Token (Model 1) and Adverb (Model 2). Then, the interaction terms between sound symbolic input measures and neonatal status were added into the Models 1 and 2, namely Neonatal Status\*Token (Model 1) and Neonatal Status\*Adverb (Model 2).

Before including the interaction terms into Models 1 and 2, we examined the relation between children’s verb knowledge and sound symbolic token input $\mathrm { { ' B } } = - 1 . 8 3$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 1 . 0 3 $ , p $= . 0 7 7$ , Model 1), which was not significant. However, sound symbolic adverb input5 was a significant predictor of children’s concurrent verb knowledge at 20 months ( $\mathrm { B } = 1 9 . 8 2$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 5 . 9 0 $ , $\mathtt { p } = . 0 0 3$ , Model 2).

To test our hypothesis regarding the strength of the associations in the PT and FT groups, we added the interaction terms into the Models 1 and 2. Model 1 revealed no significant interaction between neonatal condition and sound symbolic token $\mathrm { B } = - . 2 4 4$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 2 . 1 2$ , $\mathtt { p } = . 9 0 8 $ , Model 1). However, in Model 2, the interaction between neonatal condition and sound symbolic adverb input was significantly associated with children’s verb knowledge $\mathrm { B } = - 5 1 . 1 1$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 1 3 . 4 4 $ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1 )$ . Simple slope analysis revealed that the association between children’s verb knowledge and sound symbolic adverb input was significant in the PT group $( \mathrm { B } = 5 9 . 2 8 1 $ , $\mathrm { S E } = 1 2 . 7 5 7$ , $\mathsf { p } < . 0 0 1 )$ but not in the FT group $\mathrm { B } = 1 2 . 3 6 2$ , $\mathrm { S E } = 7 . 8 4 9 $ , ${ \tt p } = . 1 1 9 ,$ ). Model results and interaction plot are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1.

Two data points in Figure 1 raised the possibility of outliers. To test whether these observations were outliers, we calculated the dfbetas (standardized dfbeta) to estimate these observations’ influence on the slope of the regression line. One participant in the PT group and one participant in the FT group had dfbetas values larger than 1, indicating highly influential observations (Kutner et al. 2005). Although the robust regression method downweighs the influence of these observations, we reran the same analysis without these two observations, yielding a nonsignificant interaction effect.

Figure 1. The association between sound symbolic adverb input and verb knowledge in preterm and full-term 20-month-olds.

In sum, we found no significant differences in PT and FT children’s verb knowledge and their parents’ sound symbolic input. Only parental sound symbolic adverb use was significantly associated with children’s concurrent verb knowledge at 20 months. When we examined the moderating role of neonatal condition, we found that only PT children’s verb knowledge was related to parental sound symbolic adverb use. Because of the nonsignificant finding in the outlier-excluded model, this result should be examined with caution.

a The measures were calculated as the percentage of trials. Since some descriptions of children included neither manner nor path information, the sum of Path Only, Manner Only, and Path $^ +$ Manner does not add up to 1. Path Any $=$ Path Only $^ +$ Path $^ +$ Manner, Manner Any $=$ Manner Only $^ +$ Path $^ +$ Manner.

# 3.3. Preliminary analyses at Time-2

At 48 months, we measured children’s use of path and manner information in the motion event description task composed of 10 trials. In total, we had 630 descriptions from 64 participants (six of them completed 9 trials and two of them 8 trials). Around $1 0 \%$ of children’s descriptions did not include any path or manner information (e.g., she is doing something like this). The other descriptions were categorized into three categories: Manner Only, Path Only, and Path $^ +$ Manner from which we calculated the categories of Path Any (i.e., whether a child used path information in description, Path Only and $P a t h + M a n n e r )$ and Manner Any (i.e., whether a child used path information in description, Manner Only and $P a t h + \ M a n n e r )$ .

We conducted preliminary analyses to determine whether PT and FT children differed in terms of their motion event descriptions. Our dependent variables were the percentage of trials where children used Path Only, Manner Only, Path $^ +$ Manner, Path Any and Manner Any. As these variables are dependent on each other, we used MANOVA to investigate these differences. The results of one-way MANOVA revealed that PT and FT children only differed in their percentage of Manner Only descriptions, $\operatorname { F } ( 1 , 6 2 ) \ = 4 . 6 5 0$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 0 3 5$ , such that the percentage of FT children’s Manner Only descriptions $\mathbf { \omega } ^ { \mathrm { ' } } \mathbf { M } = . 5 0 5$ , $\mathrm { S D } = . 2 1 5$ ) were significantly higher than PT children $\mathbf { \ddot { M } } = . 3 8 3$ , $\mathrm { S D } = . 2 3 6$ , $\mathsf { p } = . 0 3 5 )$ . The other variables did not significantly differ between PT and FT groups $( \mathrm { F s } ( 8 9 ) < 3 . 2 1 4 , \mathrm { p }$ $> . 0 7 8 )$ . The descriptive statistics for study variables were reported in Table 3.

# 3.4. Longitudinal relations between time-1 sound symbolic input and Time-2 motion event descriptions

We then investigated the association between parental sound symbolic input and children’s motion event descriptions. Our outcome variables calculated from children’s motion event descriptions were Path Any (i.e., the percentage of descriptions in which children mentioned path information), indicating Turkish-specific expressions and Path $^ +$ Manner (i.e., the percentage of descriptions in which children mentioned both path and manner information), indicating complete motion expressions. The models reported below were also robust regression models due to the same reasons previously discussed. In building models, continuous variables were standardized. Categorical control variables were dummy coded $\left( \mathrm { P T } = 0 , \mathrm { F T } = 1 \right)$ ).

The association between sound symbolic input and Path Any descriptions was investigated by a series of multiple linear regression models. Our control variables in Models 3 and 4 were children’s age, neonatal condition, total words uttered by parents, and children’s verb knowledge at 20 months. Beyond control variables, we included sound symbolic input variables in different models: Token (Model 3) and Adverb (Model 4). None of the sound symbolic input variables were significantly related to children’s Path Any descriptions (Token: $\mathrm { B } = . 0 0 4$ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 0 3 6$ , ${ \mathfrak { p } } =$ .914; Adverb: $\mathrm { B } = . 0 1 7 $ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 0 3 8 , \mathrm { p } = . 6 5 0 )$ .

To test our hypothesis regarding the strength of the associations in PT and FT groups, we added the interaction between neonatal condition and sound symbolic input into the models: Token (Model 3) and Adverb (Model 4). None of the interaction terms significantly predicted children’s Path Any descriptions (Token: $\mathrm { B } = . 0 7 2$ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 0 6 8$ , $\mathtt { p } = . 2 9 0$ ; Adverb: $\mathrm { B } = . 1 0 7 $ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 0 7 3$ , $\mathrm { p } = . 1 4 0 ^ { \cdot }$ ). Model results were presented in Table 4.

Then, we investigated the association between sound symbolic input and Path $^ +$ Manner descriptions with two multiple linear regression models. These models (Models 5 and 6) have the same control variables with Models 5 and 6. Beyond control variables, we included sound symbolic input variables in different models: Token (Model 5) and Adverb (Model 6). None of the sound symbolic input variables were significantly related to children’s Path $^ +$ Manner descriptions (Token: $\mathrm { B } = . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 0 2 3$ , $\mathrm { \tt p } = . 9 6 4$ ; Adverb: $\mathrm { B } = . 0 4 2$ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 0 2 5 $ , $\mathsf { p } = . 1 0 8 ^ { \prime }$ ).

To test our hypothesis regarding the strength of the associations in PT and FT group, we included the interaction between neonatal condition and sound symbolic input into Models 5 and 6: Token (Model 5) and Adverb (Model 6). The interaction between neonatal condition and sound symbolic token (Model 5, $\mathrm { B } = . 0 5 7 , \mathrm { S E } = . 0 4 7 , \mathrm { p } = . 2 2 2 )$ was not significant. In Model 6, the interaction between neonatal condition and sound symbolic adverb input was significant,6 $\mathrm { B } = . 1 1 8$ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 0 4 6$ , $\mathtt { p } = . 0 1 3$ . Simple slope analysis revealed that the association between Path $^ +$ Manner descriptions and sound symbolic adverb input was significant in FT group $( \mathrm { B } = . 1 7 4 , \mathrm { S E } = . 0 7 4 , \mathrm { p } = . 0 2 3 )$ but not in the PT group $\mathrm { B } = - . 1 4 5$ , $\mathrm { S E } = . 1 1 1$ , $\mathsf { p } = . 1 9 5 )$ ). Model results and the interaction plot are presented in Table 5 and Figure $2 ^ { 7 }$

We checked for outliers for the model with significant interactions with the same method previously explained, resulting in two outliers (the same observations with the previous outlier analysis). After we excluded these two outliers, the interaction between sound symbolic adverbs and neonatal status was not a significant predictor of the percentage of descriptions including both path and manner information.

In sum, we found no significant differences in PT and FT children’s motion event descriptions. For both groups, none of the parental sound symbolic input measures was significantly associated with children’s motion event descriptions at 48 months. When we examined the moderating role of neonatal condition, the robust regression methods revealed that only PT children’s percentage of descriptions including path and manner information $( P a t h \mathrm { ~ + ~ } M a n n e r )$ was predicted by parental sound symbolic adverb use. However, the lack of significance in the outlier-excluded model puts a question mark on the validity of this result.

# 4. Discussion

This study examined the association of sound symbolic input with PT and FT children’s concurrent verb knowledge at 20 months, and motion event descriptions at 48 months, considering how sound symbolic words were used in sentences, controlling for overall parental input. Since most sound symbolic words in Turkish refer to manner of motion (Demircan 1996, Jendraschek 2001), and manner of motion is typically expressed in adverbs in Turkish (Aktan-Erciyes et al. 2022), we expected that children who heard more sound symbolic adverbs would get an early understanding of the language-specific expression of the motion event components (manner in adverbs, path in main verb). As this early specialization in language-specific motion expressions predicts children’s verb knowledge and motion event descriptions (Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun 2019, Konishi et al. 2016), we expected sound symbolic adverb input to be linked with children’s concurrent verb knowledge and later motion event descriptions. Considering the literature on PT children’s sensitivity to parental input (DeMaster et al. 2019, Doğan et al. under review), we expected the link between sound symbolic input and verb learning to be stronger for PT children. However, our results from robust linear regression models revealed that despite the lack of difference between PT and FT children in terms of sound symbolic input and outcome measures, (i) sound symbolic adverb input was concurrently and significantly related only to PT children’s verb knowledge at 20 months. In contrast, our longitudinal analyses indicated that (ii) sound symbolic adverb input at 20 months was related only to FT children’s use of path and manner information when describing motion events. However, outlier excluded models revealed null findings, indicating that these results might be inconclusive. Therefore, the results from robust regression models were discussed in terms of the trend they revealed, rather than as a significant finding.

# 4.1. What aspects of verb learning are associated with sound symbolic input?

The present study investigated the link between sound symbolic input and verb learning at two time-points (i.e., concurrent verb knowledge at 20 months and motion event descriptions at 48 month). Our results revealed the possibility of concurrent and longitudinal links between sound symbolic input and children’s verb learning. Previous research on sound symbolism examined associations with verb learning in experimental paradigms where children learn the sound symbolic verbs better than the nonsound symbolic ones (e.g., Kantartzis et al. 2011, Motamedi et al. 2021). However, these experimental studies could not answer whether sound symbolism can contribute to children’s learning of nonsound symbolic words due to the lack of investigation of nonsound symbolic word learning (Nielsen & Dingemanse 2021) in naturalistic contexts. Contrary to this hypothesis, Kızıldere et al. (2022) demonstrated associations between sound symbolic input and infants’ general word knowledge. Building on Kızıldere et al. (2022), the present study showed a trend towards an association between some aspects of sound symbolic input (i.e., adverb) and verb knowledge for a certain group of children (i.e., preterm children). If these results are replicable in different samples, it pinpoints a learning advantage of sound symbolism for nonsound symbolic words.

Furthermore, our longitudinal analyses with children’s motion event descriptions revealed a potential association of sound symbolic input with using path and manner of motion together in descriptions. Compared to the concurrent link with verb knowledge, the longitudinal result would imply a deeper association such that early sound symbolic input might result in a change in children’s attention to manner of motion. Here, early sound symbolic input might lead to a cascading effect on verb learning through directing children’s attention to manner of motion. In our study, we found that children’s descriptions including both manner and path information instead of children’s tendency to use path information were more likely to be associated with sound symbolic input. Thus, parental sound symbolic input might assist children in producing complete descriptions with both path and manner information instead of the descriptions involving the salient event component (path in Turkish).

Though our findings suggest that there are links between sound symbolic input and verb learning (both early verb knowledge and later motion event descriptions), we did not find these associations in all situations. Rather, this link depends on the aspects of sound symbolic input and the child population receiving the sound symbolic input.

# 4.2. What aspects of sound symbolic input are associated with verb learning?

In the present study, we expected two aspects of sound symbolic input to be associated with children’s verb learning: (i) the number of sound symbolic words (i.e., tokens) and (ii) the number of sound symbolic adverbs. Our results initially revealed that instead of the total number of sound symbolic words children heard (i.e., tokens), the number of sound symbolic adverbs they heard were associated with better verb learning. Sound symbolic input, especially the ones which were not used in sentences, might be used to draw infants’ attention to the conversation (Kauschke & Klann-Delius, 2007; Laing et al. 2017). Such uses might not require the referents of sound symbolic words in the immediate environment, making it difficult to map the words onto their referents. Additionally, as such uses are not necessarily in sentences, they might not create opportunities for children to interpret nonsound symbolic verbs’ meanings.

Conversely, sound symbolic words are used in sentences and generally align with how manner of motion is predominantly expressed in Turkish (e.g., Aktan-Erciyes et al. 2022, Jendraschek 2001). This way of using sound symbolic words might accustom children to the sentence structure in Turkish, facilitating the process of interpreting new words according to the new words’ position in the sentence (Fisher et al. 2010). In a sentence where a sound symbolic adverb refers to the manner of motion, children can associate this adverb with the motion easily due to its iconicity (Imai & Kita 2014). This makes the remaining unknown word (i.e., verb) to be mapped onto the remaining event component (i.e., path), easing the process of interpreting verb meaning. Thus, using sound symbolic adverbs provides more opportunities to learn verbs than the sound symbolic token input. However, this advantage might only be observed for children learning languages (i) being rich in terms of sound symbolic words, (ii) mainly using sound symbolic words in adverbial forms, and (iii) encoding manner of motion generally in subordinate clauses (i.e., verb-framed languages) such as Turkish and Japanese (Akita 2012).

The lack of nonsignificant findings when two outliers were removed from the analyses, however, puts a question mark on the relation between sound symbolic adverbs and verb learning. Although robust regression models yielded results adjusted for outliers, our results were still highly influenced by the two outliers, which had a very high number of sound symbolic adverbs (1.90 and 2.48 sound symbolic adverbs per minute) in their input compared to other participants. However, as these participants knew more verbs and combined manner and path information more frequently in their descriptions, it still aligns with our hypotheses. The issue might be due to the measurement of sound symbolic input. Mothers might not use adverbs much in free play sessions where they might not necessarily talk about events. Therefore, to investigate the role of sound symbolic adverbs more strongly, these results should be replicated in different contexts where parents are expected to produce sound symbolic adverbs.

# 4.3. For whom is sound symbolic input associated with verb learning?

The present study also investigated whether the association between parental sound symbolic input and children’s verb learning differ according to children’s neonatal condition (being born PT or FT). Our results pinpointed differential association trends based on children’s neonatal condition. For example, the concurrent link between sound symbolic input (i.e., adverbs) and children’s verb knowledge was only found for the PT group. Despite the lack of difference in PT and FT children’s verb knowledge and sound symbolic input they received, we observe a concurrent relation only in the PT group. This differential susceptibility might be due to the marked differences in neuroplasticity (Vandormael et al. 2019). The neuroplasticity of PT infants’ brain might act as a “double-edged sword,” meaning that children’s language and cognitive outcomes might be much more dependent on the quality of environmental conditions (DeMaster et al. 2019), Thus, PT children might benefit from positive environmental factors, concurrent sound symbolic input in our case, more than FT children.

Particularly, sound symbolic input might mitigate the additional difficulty of early verb learning for PT children. Considering PT infants’ difficulty mapping words onto referents (e.g., Gogate et al. 2014), we expected a special benefit of sound symbolism in mapping verbs onto manner of motion for PT children. If this was so, there would also be a cascading effect of manner discrimination and manner verb learning, revealing itself in later motion event descriptions of PT children. Nevertheless, we only found a trend toward a specific benefit for PT children’s concurrent verb knowledge but not for later motion event descriptions. Thus, sound symbolic input might yield a short-term benefit rather than long-lasting effects in PT children’s verb learning. The short-term benefit may be due to a potential need for motor skills in early verb learning. Infants might identify the actions that they can do, which in turn might aid word-to-referent mapping process for those actions (West et al. 2022). For example, children’s early verbs consist mainly of the actions that they can do (e.g., walking, running, eating, drinking). Importantly, changes at one point in time (and in multiple domains), set the stage for developmental changes at later points in time (Oakes & Rakison 2019, Oakes 2023). Hence, marked delays in motor skills in PT children (e.g., Sansavini et al. 2011, Kobaş et al. 2022) might delay PT children’s identification of actions through their own actions. Therefore, sound symbolic input might provide an easy alternative way to identify these actions that PT infants could not do at the time of testing. The lack of a longitudinal association in PT children might be due to an increase in the tendency to weigh cues other than perceptual cues in verb learning with age (Brandone et al. 2007; Maguire et al. 2006). For PT children, the interaction between delayed skills at the time of testing and concurrent input could be more important. Thus, PT children might use sound symbolic input as a cue in early verb learning to compensate for their delayed motor skills, but not benefit from the early input for the verb-learning process in general.

While concurrent relations were significant only for PT children, our longitudinal analyses showed a trend towards an association between parental sound symbolic adverb use and only FT children’s path and manner use. Unlike PT infants, FT infants might have an advantage in identifying actions that they can do. Therefore, sound symbolic input might directly help ease the discrimination and identification of event components. Discriminating event components relatively easier during infancy might lay the ground for verb learning (Konishi et al. 2016), especially how children lexicalize motion events (Aktan-Erciyes & Göksun 2019). We might find only a longitudinal trend for FT children potentially due to two reasons. First, the motion event description task at 48 months directly measures how children use path and manner, while verb knowledge at 20 months comprises not only motion verbs. Hence, verb knowledge might be too broad a measure and a different measure that is more geared towards motion might yield stronger links. Second, for FT children, sound symbolic input might not contribute to verb learning at 20 months because of the developmental timing of the input. It is possible that FT children have already benefited from sound symbolic input at earlier ages. For example, Kızıldere et al. (2022) found that sound symbolic input for FT infants was only supportive at 14 months, and this support was present at 20 months only for infants knowing fewer words. Thus, sound symbolic input at 20 months might influence FT children’s verb learning by easing event understanding, which might be reflected in their motion event descriptions at 48 months.

Considering the lack of significant associations of symbolic adverb input with PT infants’ verb knowledge and FT children’s motion event descriptions in outlier-excluded models, the association patterns previously discussed could be specific to this study’s sample. That is, the role of sound symbolic adverb input could be the same for both PT and FT children in general. Our results with robust regression models have only presented a possibility that sound symbolic adverb input differentially affects PT and FT children, which requires further replication in different samples.

The present study investigated how sound symbolic input is concurrently and longitudinally related to children’s nonsound symbolic verb learning by considering different aspects of the input, and how such relations differ for PT and FT children. However, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, parental sound symbolic input was coded from a 10-minute play session, which did not require parents to talk about motion events. Specifically, some parents might have devoted some time to introduce the toys in the playroom or to read the book provided, limiting the time to talk about motion events. Although data from free play sessions can reflect individual variations better, future studies might examine parental sound symbolic input specifically in contexts that necessitate talking about motion events. Second, our findings did not provide the mechanisms through which PT and FT children differ in benefiting from sound symbolic input. We have discussed potential different functions of sound symbolic input for PT children (i.e., compensation of delayed motor skills) and FT children (i.e., enhancing motion event conceptualization), yet future studies should specifically investigate whether sound symbolic input affects infants’ motion event discrimination by measuring children’s attention toward motion event components.

In conclusion, our study investigated how parental sound symbolic input at 20 months was linked with PT and FT children’s concurrent verb knowledge and later motion event descriptions at 48 months. Our results with robust linear regression models are the first to suggest trends toward the concurrent and longitudinal associations of sound symbolic input with verb knowledge and motion event descriptions, opening a discussion on the extended benefit of sound symbolism in learning nonsound symbolic verbs. This potential extended benefit could stem from the sound symbolic adverb input, which could differentially interact with PT and FT children’s verb learning processes. Therefore, the benefits of sound symbolic input should be investigated in different languages and populations considering how sound symbolism is used in a language and the specific needs of the child populations hearing sound symbolism.
