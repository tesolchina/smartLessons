Over the last few decades a growing number of multilingual scholars have shown an increasing interest in having the results of their research published in English-language journals. Many of these researchers, however, experience difficulties in producing effective research articles (RAs) to meet the expectations of their international disciplinary communities. In this paper we report some of the results obtained from the analysis of the responses to a large-scale online survey [http://eneida.unileon.es/eneidaquestionnaire. php] which was administered to Ph.D.-holding researchers from various disciplines, affiliated to five Spanish teaching and research institutions. The results we present here are related to Spanish scholars of Medicine, a field of research in which researchers are in need of specialized assistance in English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP). We focus on their motivations for reporting their research in English, their writing strategies, past publishing experiences and future needs for training in ERPP. The findings revealed an overall positive attitude towards writing in English, although difficulties with specific discourse features and with the most challenging sections and aspects of the RA were also identified. The information derived from this survey should allow us to design training materials that can be of assistance to multilingual scholars of medicine.

# 1. Introduction

In response to a range of socio-economic and political factors (see, for example, Ammon, 2001; Ferguson, 2007), the last two decades have seen a growing trend towards globalization of research, a trend that has gained such momentum that today English is the primary medium of academic publication even in those countries in which it is not an official language (Lillis & Curry, 2010). As a result of this, multilingual scholars have a greater need to publish in English-medium journals in order to make their research visible to a wider audience and gain international recognition. The tendency of national research evaluation bodies to reward publications in high-impact English-language journals with more credits when deciding on promotion, research funding and salary increment (see, for example, Curry & Lillis, 2004; Feng, Gulbahar, & Dawang, 2013; Lee & Lee, 2013; Moreno, 2010) has led to a situation in which many multilingual researchers seem to be compelled to write in English. This, however, is not the case in all disciplinary areas. The rise of English as the language of scientific publication is more prevalent in the Hard and Social Sciences than in it is in the Humanities (Ammon, 2001; Ferguson, 2007; Giannoni, 2008; Swales, 2004). In the Spanish academic context, for instance, Fernandez Polo and Cal Varela (2009) and Gea-Valor, Rey-Rocha, and Moreno (2014) have noted that researchers who work in Experimental Sciences and Health Sciences departments are more likely to publish in English than their counterparts in Humanities, Social Sciences and Law. Burgess, Gea-Valor, Moreno, and Rey-Rocha (2014) have also made the case that the desirability of publishing in English is greater in some fields such as Chemistry or Business Management than in others such as History, in which many researchers still resist the hegemony of English as the language of scientific output. These studies point to the fact that the motivations and needs of English as an Additional Language (EAL) scholars vary across disciplinary contexts. It is, therefore, important to look into the current attitudes and needs (language proficiency level, recurrent rhetorical difficulties, writing and learning strategies, etc.) of EAL scholars in particular fields with a view to isolating those variables that are of relevance to the process of writing and learning to write in English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP).

Recent efforts to facilitate publication have given rise to a growing volume of intercultural and cross-disciplinary genreanalytic research which provide descriptive examinations of the textual differences (and similarities) between EAL scholars' practices when writing in English and in other languages such as Chinese (e.g. Taylor & Chen, 1991), Finnish (e.g. Mauranen, 1993), Czech (e.g. Cmejrkova, 1996 ), Malay (e.g. Ahmad, 1997) or Italian (e.g. Giannoni, 2008). Spanish has not been an exception (see Burgess, 2002; Lores-Sanz, 2009; Martín-Martín, 2008; Moreno, 1998; Mur Due nas, 2007, Sheldon,\~ 2011, to cite just a few). All these studies of academic genres are particularly interesting in that they raise the issue of determining which aspects of academic discourse are subject to restrictions arising from the writing conventions of the genre and the discipline, and which aspects are governed by socio-cultural or socio-pragmatic factors. Other studies, largely using an ethnographic approach, have focused on the academic writing processes and difficulties of EAL scholars when striving to publish in this language (see, for example, Curry & Lillis, 2004; Flowerdew, 1999a, 1999b, 2001; Hanauer & Englander, 2011; Lillis & Curry, 2006, 2010; Mur Duenas, 2012\~ ). Many of these studies have emphasized the linguistic inequalities, and even non-linguistic handicaps, such as a lack of financial and material resources (see Belcher, 2007; Canagarajah, 2002; Salager-Meyer, 2008). Ammon (2012), for example, claims that, because of serious linguistic barriers and refusal to participate in linguistically “unfair” scientific communication, many non-anglophone contributions are excluded in international fora, leading to skewed scientific development. Other authors, however, such as Ferguson, Perez- Llantada, and Plo (2011), argue that the claim that linguistic inequality exists should be supported with evidence, since native English-speaking scholars may also have difficulties in acquiring a good command of academic literacy. They contend that experience or the lack of it also plays its part in determining just how difficult research writing might be (see also Swales, 2004).

Be that as it may, publishing in English-medium journals has widely been reported as representing an additional hurdle for users of EAL, especially for those who have low proficiency levels in English language skills (Ammon, 2001; Fernandez Polo  & Cal Varela, 2009) and whose writing presents rhetorical divergences (i.e. syntax, negative L1 transfer features, etc.) from the discourse norms widely accepted by the editors and reviewers of the international English-speaking community (Curry & Lillis, 2004; Flowerdew, 1999a, 1999b, 2001; Hanauer & Englander, 2011; Lillis & Curry, 2006, 2010). The extent to which authors regard linguistic factors and non-linguistic factors as the main reasons for manuscript rejection is one of the issues to be discussed in this paper.

Despite the fact that competent members of scientific communities are expected to be able to produce research papers in their field, there has been little research on how academics acquire the requisite skills and what kinds of skills are in fact involved. EAL scholars who write in English may thus find themselves in a situation where their articles do not get accepted by English language journals, but without knowing where to turn for writing assistance so as to gain the acceptance they seek and get their papers published. Cases in point are the members of the Spanish scientific community in most disciplinary areas. It is only recently that a new strand of survey-based studies (Ferguson et al., 2011; Fernandez Polo  & Cal Varela, 2009; Moreno, Rey-Rocha, Burgess, Lopez-Navarro, & Sachdev, 2012; Perez-Llantada, Plo, Ferguson, & Gibson, 2011) have emphasized the actual needs of Spanish scholars for scientific writing assistance and for pedagogical resources to train them in ERPP skills. However, the differences and similarities of Spanish scholars' needs in specific disciplinary areas and particular academic settings remain widely unexplored.

This paper reports on some of the results obtained from the analysis of the responses to a large-scale online survey which was administered to a number of Ph. D. researchers from various disciplines, either affiliated to a research-only institution or to one of four universities in Spain (see Moreno et al., 2011). On the basis of the responses to this survey, our paper focuses on the field of Medical Sciences, which is one of the areas of research in which the scholars identified themselves as needing greater specialized assistance in skills relevant to academic writing. We specifically aim to investigate Spanish scholars' attitudes and motivations, writing strategies, past experiences with publishing in medical English-language journals, difficulties encountered and future needs for training in ERPP.

The findings obtained from the analysis of these responses constitute the first stage of a broader project which intends to investigate, in successive phases, the predominant rhetorical strategies used in English and Spanish medical discourse with the ultimate aim of preparing assistance materials and implementing courses which will be of use to non-English language background scholars, and more particularly for Spanish researchers seeking to achieve the necessary academic writing skills in the field of Medicine.

# 2. Methodology

In order to determine the specific ERPP needs of Spanish researchers in the field of Medicine, we have drawn our data from the ENEIDA database (see Moreno et al., 2011). This database was created in 2010 by the ENEIDA team by means of an online questionnaire. The three major aims of the survey were: a) to collect information about Spanish researchers' publication experiences in English and Spanish-medium journals; b) to collect information about relevant variables affecting writing and learning to write in ERPP in contrast to writing in Spanish for similar purposes; and c) to obtain informants' consent to future contact. The overall aim of the research project was to allow for future intercultural and cross-cultural studies, as well as analyses of Spanish scholars' needs in ERPP training, to be carried out.

The design, validation and implementation procedures of the ENEIDA survey, as well as its participants, are described in detail in Moreno et al. (2012). In particular, twenty-four face-to-face exploratory interviews were first conducted at three of the five Spanish higher education and research institutions participating in the project. The interviewees involved represented a good cross-section in terms of gender, publication experience in English, and disciplinary field. On the basis of their responses, a 37-question online survey, mostly with associated 5-point rating scales, was designed. The questionnaire1 contained six sections: 1. personal and professional information; 2. competence in the use of Spanish and English; 3. language choices for research publication: attitudes and motivations; 4. experience with the publication of research articles; 5. current strategies when preparing a paper for publication in scientific journals; and 6. past training in RA writing and future training needs.

It was decided to survey only researchers with doctorates in order to control for lack of research experience, and to distinguish between scientific fields, publication experience and proficiency in English. After piloting the online survey among 200 informants, the final version of the questionnaire was administered online to a population of 8794 researchers with doctorates, yielding responses from 1717 informants $( 1 9 . 5 \% )$ . From this raw sample, the following filters were implemented to reach the target sample: having Castilian Spanish as L1, having received their secondary and pre-doctoral education and training in Spain, and having received their secondary and pre-doctoral education and training in Spanish. The resulting ENEIDA database consists of 1454 participants meeting those criteria.

The present paper reports on the responses to the questionnaire provided by a total of 84 informants in the field of Medical Sciences.2 These informants make up $4 . 9 \%$ of the total number of researchers surveyed. In terms of gender characteristics, $5 9 . 5 \%$ of these informants were males and $4 0 . 5 \%$ females, with a mean age of 48.19 years and an average of 18.07 years postdoctoral experience. As regards their academic status, nearly half of the respondents were senior lecturers or full professors at the universities $( 3 5 . 7 \% )$ or tenured staff at the research-only institution $( 1 4 . 3 \% )$ . Out of the 84 responses obtained, 54 $( 6 4 . 3 \% )$ of the informants expressed a willingness to collaborate in further stages of the project. Their responses provide us with a realistic and accurate picture of what aspects should be addressed in potential EAP/ERRP training courses and resources especially designed for this type of researchers.

# 3. Findings and discussion

In the first part of this section we explore Spanish scholars' motivations and attitudes towards publishing in Englishlanguage medical journals as opposed to Spanish journals. In the second part, we present the results of those sections of the survey concerning scholars' self-rated proficiency in ERPP, how this proficiency was acquired, and how it is then employed in the preparation and writing of research papers. We also report on respondents' perceptions of the effort implied by these publishing strategies and their degree of satisfaction with the outcomes. In the third part, we attempt to determine the communication difficulties faced by medical Spanish scholars and their past experiences when reporting their research in English. In the last part, we give an account of the participants' specific preferences in terms of ERPP future training needs, mainly the aspects of academic writing that should receive most attention in a given programme, and how the programme should be implemented.

# 3.1. Attitudes and motivations for publishing in English

When asked about the importance of publishing in English for the members of their medical research community (Q.19), most informants $( 9 2 . 9 \% )$ consider it “very e quite” desirable to publish in English. In fact, despite the linguistic difficulties Spanish researchers may experience when writing in a language other than their L1, the survey revealed (Q.12) that English is the preferred language of publication. The mean number of research articles (RAs) that the respondents have published as corresponding authors over the last 10 years is much higher for English than it is for Spanish, as seen in Table 1.

Table 1 Average number of articles published in English and Spanish in the 2001e2011 period.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Articles in English</td><td>Articles in Spanish</td></tr><tr><td> Medical sciences</td><td>15.7</td><td>4.9</td></tr></table></body></html>

As for the reasons that have generally influenced the decision to publish most of their papers in English (Q.13), the most commonly selected was the desire to communicate the results of their research to the members of the international scientific community $( 8 8 . 1 \% )$ . This was followed by the desire for their work to be widely recognized $( 8 6 . 9 \% )$ , the need to meet the requirements for professional promotion $( 7 9 . 8 \% )$ and, in close connection to this need, in bid to obtain more citations $( 7 3 . 8 \% )$ . Considering that Spanish institutions value publications in high-impact English-medium journals more highly, it is not surprising to find evidence of the effects of this policy conditions on the choice of language for publication. As a matter of fact, the main reasons reported for deciding against publishing research articles in Spanish (Q.17) are the lack of prestigious journals in this language, and the fact that publication in Spanish would not offer the scholars the benefits they seek. Conversely, the main reasons that have led them away from considering publication in English are a perceived lack of writing skills in academic English, a belief that they would fail to meet the standard that international journals require, and a lack of familiarity with the writing conventions expected by the journals in which they seek to publish (e.g. placing their research in a wider context, clearly expressing their contribution to the field, making sure their conclusions fit their objectives stated in the introduction, etc.). They also cited, though less frequently, the fact that writing in English is a time-consuming task which implies too much effort along with economic limitations such as the need to pay translators and text editors resulting in increased costs for which funds are not available. These findings support the general perception observed in previous studies that scholars who use English as an additional language are at a disadvantage.

The reasons cited above contrast sharply with their main motivations for publishing in Spanish (Q.13) which, in all cases, received lower ratings: The desire to communicate the results of their research to the local community $( 3 8 . 1 \% )$ , in response to a commission or invitation from an institution, association or publisher $( 3 5 . 7 \% )$ , and as a way of fostering the continued existence of medical journals in Spanish $( 3 4 . 5 \% )$ . Several of the respondents in fact remarked that, since most journals in Spanish in the field of Medicine are not included in prestigious citation indexes, publishing exclusively in English-language journals has become an established practice across the board, a fact that has led to the almost total disappearance of the national journals in this area of research.

We should also note that the reported growing interest among Spanish academics in actively participating in international scientific communication results in their frequent exposure to the influences of international disciplinary practices. As a consequence of this, they may consciously or unconsciously acquire those conventions that will, almost inevitably, be reflected in their national-level academic practices as well. This is the conclusion Salager-Meyer, Alcaraz-Ariza, and Zambrano (2003) reached in their study of Spanish, English and French medical research articles (RAs). In their diachronic analysis they found that, in the last few years, there has been a growing tendency among Spanish writers to adopt the rhetorical conventions which characterise the international English-speaking community as a result of the recent modifications in Spanish cultural values regarding scientific writing. A similar point has been made by Giannoni (2008) in relation to Italian medical discourse. Likewise, Cmejrkova (1996)  attributes the recent changes in Czech academic discourse to the growing dominion of English academic norms. Furthermore, the loss of national academic genres has been noted by Mauranen (1993) with regard to the research article in Finnish, and this also seems to be the likely fate in the short term for the RA in Spanish in the field of Medicine.

What is thus clear is that national academic styles, while embedded in cultural epistemological traditions, are greatly influenced by external social and political circumstances that today are leading to the unavoidable globalization of scientific discourse. As a reaction to this, variations found in the use of English across national boundaries is giving rise to calls for linguistic diversity and greater tolerance of different rhetorical styles in international publications (see, for example, Canagarajah, 2002; Salager-Meyer, 2008). In the particular case of Europe, however, with the implementation of the Bologna process in higher education and the consequent mobility of students and scholars, the use of English continues to expand with the introduction of English-medium content courses at an increasing number of European universities (Ferguson, 2007). Far from the establishment of national protective policies that defend linguistic diversity in academic settings, the picture is quite the opposite in Spain, as mentioned earlier, with publishing output in English being rewarded with professional promotion and salary increments.

Turning now to the question of how the medical informants feel when they write up the results of their research for English-language journals (Q.20), $5 8 . 3 \%$ of the respondents feel very motivated, fairly capable $( 5 1 . 2 \% )$ , sure of themselves $( 4 7 . 6 \% )$ and neither loyal nor disloyal to their native language $( 3 5 . 7 \% )$ . In contrast, although their perception of their own ability and their feelings of self-assurance are higher when writing in Spanish, their motivation for writing in this language is much lower than in English. Not surprisingly, when asked about their plans for their next publications (Q.21), they reported that it was “quite e very” likely $( 8 5 . 7 \% )$ that they would write their next article for an English-language journal. This figure contrasts sharply with a mere $1 9 \%$ of informants who responded that it was “quite e very” likely that they would write it for a Spanish journal (Q.26). This interest in being involved with the international disciplinary community was also made patent when we asked them about their role as peer reviewers for scientific journals. A high percentage of informants $( 8 4 . 5 \% )$ responded that they have in fact performed this task in the last ten years. Out of these, $4 4 \%$ of the respondents have been reviewers exclusively for journals in English, $8 . 3 \%$ exclusively for journals in Spanish, and $3 2 . 1 \%$ for both English and Spanish journals. The average number of different journals they have reviewed for was 1 in Spanish as opposed to 7 in English.

Regarding the consequences that they perceive when publishing in one language or the other (Q.22), the respondents reported that publishing in English greatly facilitates the dissemination of Spanish research internationally and the participation of Spanish scholars in international networks $( 9 0 . 5 \% )$ , as well as the visibility of Spanish research on topics of international concern $( 8 2 . 1 \% )$ . On the other hand, the informants are well aware of the negative consequences of writing in English, namely that this hinders the development of academic writing in Spanish, research on topics of local concern and the survival of medical science journals in Spanish.

# 3.2. Needs analysis of the learning situation

With regard to scholars' self-reports of proficiency in EAP (Q.11), as seen in Table 2, the majority of our medical respondents rated their academic reading skills in English as high or very high. More than half of the informants also consider their level of competence in maintaining correspondence with editors and peer reviewers as high-very high, and over half of the informants reported high levels of writing proficiency in ERPP. Their listening comprehension skills, mainly in terms of understanding lectures, were rated at lower levels and even lower levels were reported for speaking skills and spoken interaction proficiency, especially with regard to presenting papers at international conferences and asking or responding to questions in these fora. These findings are consistent with those of Fernandez Polo and Cal Varela (2009)  , who report high levels of deficits in English oral skills, particularly with regard to pronunciation. Perez-Llantada et al. (2011)  have also noted that Spanish academics feel unfairly disadvantaged in spoken communication relative to Anglophone scholars and lack, for instance, the ability to use humor in their presentations at conferences. This indicates that special attention to developing speaking skills in academic settings should be provided.

As for the strategies that had helped them to learn how to write research papers in English in the past (Q.30), most of the respondents $( 6 9 \% )$ reported that they had acquired their writing competencies by means of engaging in the actual task of writing, and in $6 6 . 7 \%$ of the cases, by paying attention to the rhetorical features of the published output of professional authors, being this latter strategy, we assume, an unconscious process acquired through reading rather than through actual instruction. Other useful strategies that the informants reported were reading the comments from journal editors, peer reviewers, and the editors of their own texts $( 5 3 . 6 \% )$ . This supports the effectiveness of the socio-linguistic approaches (Bazerman, 1988; Freedman & Medway, 1994) that argue for the study of the rhetorical features of a genre in the social and cultural context in which it is produced, encouraging a close engagement of novice scholars with disciplinary communities so that an understanding of their expectations and social practices might be reached.

To a lesser extent, the informants also found very helpful the advice received on research visits abroad $( 4 1 . 7 \% )$ , and the suggestions from senior members of their research groups $( 4 0 . 5 \% )$ , although manuals and textbooks were regarded as useful tools in acquiring academic writing skills by a smaller number of respondents $( 1 6 . 7 \% )$ . The survey also revealed that medical informants were apparently unable to see the applicability of doctoral courses on academic discourse to the task of learning to write in English, arguably because they did not have the possibility to take these types of courses. This, therefore, reflects not a lack of appreciation but a lack of experience with such courses. The same was said for participation in workshops and practical seminars on publication skills, we assume, because scholars had not in fact experienced instruction of this type. This lack of familiarity points to a paucity of specialized courses that focus on formal academic writing training in Spanish higher education institutions of Medicine, as reported in previous studies (see, for example, Moreno, 2010). Provision of funding for such courses should thus be considered by the national government.

In relation to the manuscript preparation process (Q.27), before sending their articles to an international medical journal, most respondents $( 8 1 \% )$ reported that they familiarise themselves to a great extent with the topics the journal covers, the writing conventions, i.e. the structural elements, expected by the journal $( 6 9 \% )$ , the instructions in the journal's style guide $( 6 1 . 9 \% )$ , and the editorial process that the journal typically follows $( 5 7 . 1 \% )$ . However, less than half of the respondents $( 4 7 . 6 \% )$ reported high levels of familiarity with the stylistic features of academic writing specific to the journal. These findings suggest that academic writing courses might seek to draw participants' attention to journal-specific stylistic features.

As regards the frequency of use of writing strategies (Q.28), as seen in Fig. 1, over half of the medical informants opt for writing their papers directly in English and then, in most cases, having their texts edited by an expert editor familiar with their field. The second preference is to write their papers directly in English and then submit them without any further revision. This is followed by the strategy of writing their papers in Spanish and then having them translated, in most cases, by a native speaker of English who is very familiar with their field. The least preferred option reported consists of writing their articles partly in English and partly in Spanish and then having them translated and edited mainly by native-speakers of English familiar with their research area.

Although these strategies (especially those which imply writing directly in English) typically involve a high degree of effort, the respondents reported that the effort put into these publishing strategies is matched by the high degree of satisfaction derived from the outcomes. The results from this part of the survey mainly highlight the important role of “language brokers” (Lillis & Curry, 2006, 2010), and especially expert editors, in the process of preparing a manuscript, this being a type of language support that should be offered by universities in order to ameliorate linguistic disadvantages experienced by EAL medical writers.

# 3.3. Publishing difficulties in English: past experiences

Another section of the questionnaire (Q.25) was devoted to investigating the sections of the article and other documents involved in its publication with which informants have experienced more difficulties when writing in English. As seen in Table 3, our medical informants reported that the Discussion section is by far the most challenging part to write. This was also the case for most of the respondents from the other disciplines surveyed, no doubt as a result of the fact that the rhetorical effort involved in interpreting the results obtained in the light of comparisons with those of previous studies is greater than it is in other sections.

Table 3 also shows other parts of the research paper that present difficulties for both groups of informants: the theoretical framework, the introduction, the results, the conclusions, the abstract and the correspondence with the editor. As expected, the least problematic parts are the materials and methods section, the covering letter accompanying the paper when it is sent to the journal, and the acknowledgements. Uzuner (2008), in his extensive review of empirical research concerning multilingual scholars' publication practices, reports the most rhetorically complex sections (introductions, literature reviews and discussions) as those that cause more difficulties for these scholars. In the light of the results obtained in previous studies, Ozuner concludes that a failure to write effective papers in English can be mainly attributed to cross-cultural stylistic divergences between EAL scholars' cultural values and the writing practices of the mainstream disciplinary community, i.e., the failure to create a research niche in their papers by boldly persuading the members of the international disciplinary community of the significance of their research or by critically discussing and evaluating arguments.

It was interesting to notice that for the medical informants the response to peer reviewers' comments is the second aspect that gives them most trouble, whereas for the rest of the disciplines as a whole, this represents the fourth aspect in terms of degree of difficulty. It may be argued that for medical researchers who seek to publish in English-medium journals, where the level of competitiveness is very high, trying to convince reviewers of the relevance of their studies represents a particularly daunting task. As one of our informants remarked, in an open-ended question, there is a frequent accusation of parochialism from reviewers in English-medium journals. This indicates that for our informants justifying the significance of their research for an international readership is a major concern. In this regard, Canagarajah (2002) has questioned the need for off-network researchers to position their work in relation to centre scholarship when they are in fact dealing with the local and cultural concerns of the periphery.

Indeed, the social interaction between authors-editors/reviewers can become quite complex when it involves a number of revisions and resubmissions. Furthermore, responding to reviewers' comments requires a high level of rhetorical proficiency on the part of the writer, especially in those most face-threatening cases in which the authors have to justify non-compliance with the reviewers' suggestions. For example, in her analysis of a successful author's response to a reviewer's comments, Belcher (2007: 13) notes that his comments “exhibit a confident sense of authority, a willingness to accommodate and compromise with, but also flatly reject, various reviewer recommendations”. Gosden (2003: 100) too has highlighted the difficulties novice writers may encounter when faced with “conflicting signals” in referee reports, which very often involve evaluative language. Fortanet-Gomez (2008) , in her interdisciplinary analysis of the evaluative language of referee reports, points out that the main difficulty that this genre typically presents for users of EAL and novice writers is related to ambiguities which frequently result in a failure to respond adequately to reviewers' demands. She argues that, on some occasions, it is difficult to discern what the referee wants, whether it is a problem of language or content, or if they simply failed to understand what the writers meant. It might be the case that, largely due to cross-cultural differences, EAL users misinterpret invitations to revise as rejections, especially when overwhelmed by the negative critical comments and the number of changes requested (see, Belcher, 2007; Canagarajah, 2002; Kourilova, 1996).

As for a possible explanation for the high degree of difficulty that our Medicine informants experience when dealing with reviewers' comments, we could speculate that this is related to crossdisciplinary variation in terms of critical patterns and the volume of critical comment. Fortanet-Gomez (2008) , for example, concludes that in the field of Business and Economics referee reports are more critical and negative than in Linguistics. It would thus be interesting to look at whether or not the number and type of critical comments are higher in Medicine than in other fields. In any case, an effort should be made on the part of editors/reviewers to avoid those situations where lack of comprehension or feelings of discouragement result in the EAL user and the novice writer deciding not to submit an improved version of the paper.

Another subsection of the survey (Q.18) focused on the self-perceived difficulties that have prevented the respondents as corresponding authors from publishing research articles in English journals. On a scale from $1 =$ not at all, to $5 = \mathtt { a }$ lot, they reported the following factors:

Features of my writing in English, e.g. grammatical, vocabulary, ways of expressing ideas clearly in paragraphs and style mistakes such as long sentences or complex constructions. (5.00)   
Not offering results of sufficient interest to the readers of the journal. (3.00)   
- Supposed flaws in certain areas of the content of the research, e.g. design methods, use of statistics, etc. (3.00)   
- Not following the writing conventions expected by the journal in which I have chosen to report my research, e.g. putting my research into a wider context, appropriately reviewing the literature, clearly expressing my contribution to field, making sure my conclusions fit my objectives, etc. (2.5)   
- Not writing in accordance with the instructions in the journal's style guide, e.g. word limits, format of tables, pages, citations, bibliography, etc. (2.00)   
Not writing on a topic that fitted the content of the journal to which I sent the article. (1.5)

The frequency of occurrence of these aspects coincides to a great extent with the types of revision reported that referees and editors of English journals most frequently require authors to make (Q.24). However, although the respondents see the features of their writing in English as the main obstacle to publishing in English journals, when asked about the main reasons put forward by editors and reviewers in those cases of rejection, the frequency of occurrence of these aspects varied:

Supposed flaws in certain areas of the content of the research. (2.59)   
Features of the writing of the paper. (2.07)   
- Not having reflected the writing conventions expected by the journal in which I have chosen to report my research. (2.05)   
Not having adhered to the instructions in the journal's style guide. (1.63)

This indicates that, although reviewers and editors of international English language journals in the field of Medicine give great importance to the use of appropriate discourse features, the primary reason for rejection is related to flaws in the content of the study. These results are consistent with those of Mungra and Webber (2010), who analysed peer reviewer comments of medical articles written in English by Italian researchers. They found that the most frequent critical comments were in the area of scientific and methodological content, followed by lexical and grammatical errors, clarity of expression and verbosity or repetition. Kourilova (1996) , in her analysis of peer review reports received by Slovak medical researchers, also reports language-based features as secondary factors for rejection. She found that most negative remarks on language and style were general (see, also, Gosden, 2003), although some comments on specific points of language were included, such as those targeting the inappropriateness in the choice of hedges (i.e. modality) when expressing claims. While Hewings (2006) and Belcher (2007) note that in their studies of reviewers' comments on rejected manuscripts submitted to an applied linguistics journal, style/language usage alone was never mentioned as a reason for rejecting papers by non-native speakers of English, they also found that negative comments on language features were very frequent. Likewise, Mur Duenas (2012) \~ notes the inclusion of a high number of non-specific negative comments related to language or style in ‘major revision’ reports in the field of Finance. Although these studies suggest that the most frequent reason for rejection is content-based, they also confirm the great attention paid by reviewers of international journals to language use.

# 3.4. Future training needs in RA publication skills

All of our informants, as mentioned earlier, were experienced writers (with an average of 18 years of postdoctoral trajectory), many of whom, we assumed, had received implicit academic formation (e.g. reading other authors' papers) and explicit instruction (e.g. academic writing courses). However, the survey revealed that they still feel that they need further instruction in publication skills. When asked about their needs in terms of future ERPP training (Q.31), over half of the informants $( 5 1 . 4 \% )$ expressed their intention to continue their training in the writing of RAs with a view to sending these papers to English-medium scientific journals. As regards the aspects of academic writing that should be given more attention in a particular programme (Q.32), as seen in Fig. 2, the respondents consider that the main focus should be academic writing for publication purposes in areas related to their research, and the problems that Spanish authors typically have when writing RAs. This was followed by aspects related to how to write each section of the RA, to academic writing for the journals in which they intend to publish and to academic writing for general publishing purposes. General aspects of academic writing and the most appropriate order in which each section should be written were considered secondary points to be included in a training course. These results thus highlight the importance of specific courses and provide useful information on the content of these courses, particularly the need for courses targeting specific disciplinary areas.

Furthermore, most of the respondents $( 7 7 . 0 \% )$ showed their interest in learning how to better ‘tell my research story’ in accordance with the discourse and writing conventions of the journal (Q.33). They also mentioned that their training sessions should develop those aspects of RA writing aimed at arriving at a better understanding of ‘what’ counts as research in scientific journals $( 4 2 . 6 \% )$ , the similarities and differences between research writing for publication in Spanish and international journals $( 4 1 . 0 \% )$ , and the review process in scientific journals: the editor's role, the role of the peer reviewers, etc. $( 3 4 . 4 \% )$ . At a more fine-grained level of academic literacy, in relation to the specific aspect of ‘how to tell my research story’, (Q.34) the following items were ranked in importance according to a scale ranging from $1 =$ none, to $5 = \mathtt { a }$ lot:

Strategies to express my contribution to the field more clearly. (4.44)   
Ways of clearly expressing my interpretation of the results of my study. (4.39)   
Strategies to ensure text flow so that my readers will readily understand the case I present. (4.27)   
- Structures for expressing my ideas in correct grammar. (4.27)   
Ways of clearly linking the various parts of the article, i.e. ideas, paragraphs and sections. (4.22)   
Structures for expressing my ideas clearly and precisely. (4.22)   
Ways of expressing my claims with the appropriate amount of confidence and certainty. (4.10)   
- Ways of organizing my ideas logically and coherently. (4.05)   
- Appropriate academic style in my discipline, e.g. personal versus impersonal. (3.85)   
Ways of appropriately reviewing the literature. (3.73)   
The specific terminology in my field. (3.66)

Getting familiar with the writing conventions favoured by the international community in their field (as opposed to the prevalent writing conventions in their own academic national culture) thus represents a priority for our informants. Not surprisingly, they are particularly concerned with grasping those strategies which are used to enhance the contribution of their research. This is arguably due to the reported fact that editors and reviewers of English-medium journals pay considerable attention to the justification of the relevance of research, especially for an international audience.

Finally, when asked about the most suitable ways of receiving RA writing training (Q.36), the preferred options were (on a scale from $1 \ : = \ : \mathrm { n o t }$ at all, to $5 = \mathrm { v e r y } .$ ) under the auspices of translation and authors' editing services (4.00), through practically-oriented workshops on the writing of research articles (3.93), and by means of computer-based interactive help with the writing of research papers (3.69). They rated as less useful textbooks with practical exercises on various aspects of research article writing (3.07) and theoretically-oriented books on the writing of research articles (2.56). For our informants, the ideal profile of personnel to run these training sessions (Q.37) is a professional with experience with publication in scientific journals (4.59), followed by people with experience of author's editing of research articles (4.36) and of translation of research papers (4.15). Lower rates were given to people with research experience in their fields (3.92), in the teaching of academic writing (3.70) and with experience of research on academic texts (3.66).

# 4. Conclusions

This study has explored the current situation of Spanish scholars in the Medical Sciences regarding publishing in Englishmedium international journals. By means of a needs analysis survey, we have examined attitudes, experiences and difficulties with the publication of papers. The overall results certainly point to a generalised need for training in specific areas of academic writing and writing for publication purposes. The responses to the survey have also revealed a sharp decline in national medical journals that is leading to the progressive disappearance of the RA in Spanish. In relation to this situation, the informants have shown an ambivalent attitude: although most respondents consider that publishing only in English is an advantage for their careers, for the most part they also perceive disadvantage in their abilities to communicate in English, not to mention the fact that it is costly and time-consuming.

Since the dominance of English as the language of scientific communication will likely continue in the next years (Matsuda, 2013), in order to confront linguistic disadvantages, some urgent measures should be adopted. One of them is related to a greater flexibility on the part of editors/reviewers in accepting the discourse patterns which may be considered as ‘anomalies’ for the members of the Anglophone international community (see, for example, Ammon, 2012, Gunnarsson, 2000). In this regard, many voices argue for a shift to English as an International Language (EIL) as a lingua franca variety for participating in a growing global community. As Lee McKay (2002) points out, contrary to popular perception, an international language is not just a language that has a large number of native speakers. She claims that for a language to be international means that the language has developed to where it is no longer linked to a single culture or nation but serves both global and local needs as a language of wider communication and, therefore, it must belong to those who use it. Given the growing number of EAL users worldwide, the author discusses the various problems associated with using the native speaker model as the final goal of English learning. She concludes that in meeting the needs of such EAL users “it is essential that the native speaker fallacy be challenged” (p. 24), thus questioning the validity of a single standard form of English.

Another important aspect that would undoubtedly contribute to diminishing inequality is a national government policy that, in accordance with the values of internationalization it promotes, would foster an increase in university language support, such as in-house editing and translating services, and sufficient funding for the implementation of specialized courses in ERPP both for students in higher education and teaching/research staff.

The results obtained from the analyses of the responses will contribute to a better preparation of instructional programmes specially designed to deal with the needs of EAL researchers and novice writers in the field of Medicine. The most salient components of such programmes should include a focus on discourse features of academic writing specific to the Medical Sciences (i.e. typical sentence length, ways of expressing ideas clearly, appropriate style, how to organise paragraphs, grammar and vocabulary), a special emphasis on the development of communicative speaking skills (e.g. oral interaction and presentations at conferences, clear pronunciation) and of the rhetorical strategies favoured by the international disciplinary community (i.e. the typical promotional moves recurrent in the most rhetorically complex sections of an RA, such as justifying and highlighting the relevance of one's research). The issue of how to interpret and respond to reviewers' comments, especially in those cases that imply reasoned resistance to criticism (see, for example, Belcher, 2007; Cargill & O'Connor, 2009), should also take a prominent position in medical writing training programmes.

A most useful training approach which could help EAL writers understand more easily the communicative purpose of the RA and its various sections should thus be based on a genre-driven pedagogy, largely consisting in a prior discussion of the socio-cultural context in which the RA occurs. This should be followed be the explicit teaching of functions and language structures of typical academic texts, especially the most challenging sections reported by our informants, with a special focus on intercultural variation. By making scholars aware of the similarities and differences in the rhetorical strategies preferred by the members of their specific disciplinary community, EAL writers may feel more confident about the rhetorical options they can choose depending on the context and type of audience they are addressing.

In order to gain more insights into the needs of EAL scholars, the findings obtained in questionnaire-based research, such as that reported here, could be complemented by ethnographic studies and intercultural text analyses which can provide more evidence on the publication situations and difficulties faced by multilingual academics in specific cultural and disciplinary contexts.
