Teacher educator professional learning, like teacher education, can be messy and complex. This study's purpose was to explore physical education teacher educators' understandings of how their participation in communities of practice (CoP) supported their own professional development. More specifically, significant dynamics and group processes of CoP were explored. Results indicated that engagement in CoP provided a foundation for collaboration and reduced isolation, allowing participants to extend teaching and research capacities. Significant social dynamics and group processes that shaped their practice included a common focus, personal and professional relationships, safe but challenging spaces, and shared commitment.

# 1. Introduction

The notion of professional development of teacher educators has begun to emerge as a touchstone for not only what it means to become a teacher educator, but also to learn as a teacher educator. (Loughran, 2014, p.217)

Teacher educator professional learning, like teacher education, can be messy and complex. As a result, developing as teacher educators, “committed to both practice and scholarship requires mentoring and professional development support” (Gallagher, Griffin, Parker, Kitchen, & Figg, 2011, p. 880). Yet, content specific professional development for teacher educators is rare (Berry, 2009; Cole, 1999; Murray, 2005). Because professional development programs are low on the priority list in most university settings, teacher educators themselves are forced to seek professional learning opportunities alone or collectively (Gallagher et al., 2011), most frequently, taking their professional learning into their own hands (Swennen & Bates, 2010). As indicated in Loughran’s (2014) opening quote, teacher educator professional development serves as a trademark for becoming and learning as a teacher educator, holding with it the potential to make a significant impact on the preparation of future teachers.

While the professional development of teachers has been extensively studied (e.g., Darling-Hammond, Wei, Andree, Richardson, & Orphanos, 2009), little is known about how teacher educators develop professionally (Smith, 2003). In fact, teacher educators themselves remain an, “under-researched, poorly understood, and ill-defined occupational group” (Murray, 2016, p. 35). It is only recently that the teacher educators’ professional development has come to be a topic of both interest and concern (Bates, Swennen, & Jones, 2011). Furthermore, Kosnik, Miyata, Cleovoulou, Fletcher, and Menna (2015) provide a compelling argument for discipline specific studies of teacher educators, indicating the work of teacher educators is multifaceted and therefore studies, “need to capture the complexity of their work by examining their identities, practices, backgrounds, transition, challenges, individual talents, and contexts” (p. 217).

# 1.1. Life as a teacher educator

While there are exceptions, academic life as a teacher educator has been portrayed as lonely and personally demanding (Hadar & Brody, 2010); characterized by stress, pressure, and uncertainty (Austin, 2002). Expectations of colleges and universities in which teacher educators work, serve, at times unwittingly, to add to the uncertainty by conveying conflicting messages. In one instance, they represent, “a culture of competition among institutions, among programs and among faculty” where “cooperation is often not only difficult to achieve but rarely rewarded” (Diamond, 2006; para. 4). Yet, in others, they are a place where conversations and connections are viewed as a necessity for program development and professional growth (Cole, 1999).

Research indicates that, when provided the opportunity, teacher educators prefer to work with colleagues (Shagrir, 2010) and while the programmatic and research benefits of collaboration are well documented (Graber, 1993; MacPhail, Patton, Parker & Tannehill, 2014; Pennington, Prusak, & Wilkinson, 2014), the organization of colleges and universities sometimes hampers informal and open dialogue while surreptitiously promoting individuality over collegiality. For example, the junctures to engage in more than casual conversation regarding teaching and student learning or other classroom challenges, quandaries, and ‘ah-ha’ moments are few (Berry, 2009; Gallagher et al., 2011; Hadar & Brody, 2010). In some situations, most “interaction among faculty is often limited to cordial everyday talk” (Hadar & Brody, 2010) and “collegial interchange frequently stops at the classroom door” (p. 1643).

# 1.2. Professional development for teacher educators

To address the unique working conditions and expectations of teacher educators, professional development must be “purposefully conceptualized, thoughtfully implemented, and meaningfully employed” (Loughran, 2014, p. 10) to support growth and change (Hadar & Brody, 2010). Smith (2003) identifies the myriad of professional competencies required of teacher educators to include, but not limited to “content, pedagogical, organizational, group dynamic and communicative and developmental and personal growth” (p.202). In addition to their teaching roles, teacher educators are expected to conduct and disseminate research, add to the teacher education knowledge base, develop reciprocal collaborations with schools, and promote education in general (Oser, 1998; Smith, 2003). The trajectory of a teacher educator's professional development is, therefore, “not limited to expanded theoretical knowledge in a specific subject matter, but it is more a whole person development with cognitive and affective aspects” (Smith, 2003, p.203). This view of professional development is therefore not constrained to time-defended, intentional activities meant to achieve specific goals or standardsdrather it is a way of life (Barak, Gidron, & Turniansky, 2010).

Physical education literature reflects a relative absence of contemporary research on the professional journeys of physical education teacher educators (Graber, Templin, & Metzler, 2015; McAvoy, MacPhail, & Heikinaro-Johansson, 2015). Similar to teacher education in general (Kosnik et al., 2015), physical education and as an extension physical education teacher education (PETE), has long been described as a marginalized profession (Pagnano, 2011). Exacerbating PETE marginalization in higher education is a sense of isolation, as there are frequently only one or two physical education teacher educators in a single university setting, and PETE in many universities is housed outside of schools of education (Ayers & Housner, 2008). Thus, opportunities to engage in discourse about teacher education in these settings are limited.

Providing a conceptual framework with which to expand our knowledge of physical education teacher educators, Lawson (1991) suggested future research including influences on and questions about their work lives, role orientations, productivity, and affiliations. Using Lawson's suggestions as a starting point, McAvoy et al. (2015) completed a review of literature on physical education teacher educators (1990e2014). In particular, they noted scant attention to paradigmatic and occupational communities to which physical education teacher educators belong, highlighting an almost 20 year void in studies focusing on, “how, why, or to what end PE teacher educators enact the scholarly aspect of their professional work” (p.172).

It is widely accepted that being part of a community, network, or team offers one of the most powerful modes of professional development (MacPhail et al., 2014; Parker, Patton, & Tannehill, 2012); suggesting that learning between members is even more powerful than individual learning (Barak et al., 2010). Participation within a community provides a space for authentic conversations, where members find reinforcement in and challenge each other's experiences and stories (Gallagher et al., 2011). Further, knowledge creation is social, produced through meaningful dialog and conversations that occur within communities (Barak et al., 2010). Knowledge creation, therefore, is a non-linear process where, “new ideas and innovations emerge between rather than within people” (Paavola, Lipponen, & Hakkarainen, 2004, p. 564).

# 1.3. Communities of practice

Many educational theorists have promoted learning as participation (e.g., Dewey, 1916; Lave & Wenger, 1991; Schon, 1983; € Vygotsky, 1978). In these situations learning is assumed to be social and situated; often occurring in informal contexts such as communities through interaction, communication, taking part, and gaining access to different contexts (Quennerstedt & Maivorsdotter, 2017). In recent literature, communities of practice (CoP) represent a promising theme in the professional development of teacher educators (Brody & Hadar, 2011; Hadar & Brody, 2010; Swennen & Bates, 2010). While different interpretations of CoP make it challenging to apply the concept in meaningful ways (Boylan, 2010); it nonetheless provides a powerful framework for examining teacher educator learning. In one conceptualization, CoP are a social organization in which learning and participation takes place (Boylan, 2010). As such CoP “are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly” (Wenger & Wenger-Trayner, 2015; p. 1). Describing differences in configuration of CoP in practice, Wenger and Wenger-Trayner, (2015; p. 3) stated:

They come in a variety of forms. Some are quite small; some are very large, often with a core group and many peripheral members. Some are local and some cover the globe. Some meet mainly face-to-face, some mostly online. Some are within an organization and some include members from various organizations. Some are formally recognized, often supported with a budget; and some are completely informal and even invisible.

These varied communities serve multiple purposes including professional learning, increased research productivity, enhanced instruction, and promotion of school improvement (Borko, 2004;

Little, 2002; MacPhail et al., 2014). They “seek to break down walls of solo practice” (Byrk, 2016, p. 469) and create spaces where faculty learn from and with each other, promoting professional growth (Hadar & Brody, 2010). They are not haphazard groups. Rather, CoP are meaningful, purposeful, and revolve around authentic tasks (Parker, Patton, Madden, & Sinclair, 2010). Consequently, CoP provide a professional learning process that is meaningful and relevant to individual members.

Wenger and Wenger eTraynor (2015) indicated that it is by developing the three elements of domain, community, and practice that a CoP can be established. First, the domain refers to a group's identity which is defined by a shared area of interest. Participants pledge allegiance to the domain, and “therefore a shared competence that distinguishes members from other people” (Wenger & Wenger-Trayner, 2015; p. 2). Next, the community insinuates that members pursue their interests through engagement in purposeful activities and meaningful discussions, facilitating learning from and with each other. Finally, the practice, represents a shared repertoire of resources including experiences, stories, tools, and processes of addressing any stumbling blocks the group may encounter along the way. Creation of these resources takes considerable time and sustained interaction.

Hadar and Brody (2010) proposed a three-layered model regarding the effectiveness of CoP in teacher education, where each layer is prerequisite to the following. The initial layer represents the breaking of isolation. At this stage there is space for safe discussion, social and professional interaction, and cross-area discourse resulting in the development of a group that could make professional connections. This communication around the common connections then leads to a second layer of improved teaching and/ or research. Professional learning regarding research and teaching and a resultant increase in self-efficacy and competence provides the third layer of the model. As Tannehill, Parker, Tindall, Moody, and MacPhail (2015) indicate, “The formation of a community of teacher educators as a conduit for on-going dialogue, individual and group reflection, systematic action, and mutual respect, might well create an environment that nurtures deep learning and thought fostering individual and collective research capacity” (p. 302).

The study of teacher educator professional learning can be greatly enhanced when grounded in the distinguishing elements associated with CoP. For example, trust and respect built within CoP has been shown to lead to safe and supportive environments (Whitcomb, Borko, & Liston, 2009). The creation of such environments, “emphasizes the contribution of relationship, caring, and mutual support within the group while at the same time focusing on the professional development of individuals within their own discipline” (Brody & Hadar, 2015, p. 247). While much is known about CoP potential to enhance professional learning substantially less is known about the processes with respect to how they function, especially in higher education. To date, little research (MacPhail et al. 2014; Tannehill et al., 2015) has been conducted specifically examining physical education teacher education CoP. This paper attempts to begin to fill that gap.

# 1.4. Purpose

How physical education teacher educators engage in CoP as professional development is important. The purpose of this study was to explore physical education teacher educators’ understandings of how their participation in a CoP supported their own professional development. More specifically, significant dynamics and group processes of CoP were explored. Insight on how CoP members engage in a process of professional development can contribute to our understanding of the features of effective professional learning for teacher educators.

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Participants

Participants included 36 teacher educators representing nine physical education teacher education CoP in the North America, Europe, Scandinavia, and Southeast Asia (see Table 1). Participants' teacher education experience averaged 13.7 years (range 2e34 years) and they held faculty ranks ranging from non-tenure track lecturer to professor. Wenger and Wenger-Trayner’s (2015) elements of CoP were used to screen and identify suitable groups. Prior to data collection, a list of potential participants was created that included long term teachers educator communities known firsthand or recently reported in academic literature. To be included each group had to demonstrate an identity, defined by a shared domain of interest (i.e., research, teacher education). Second, collectively the members of the community had to actively pursue their interests in their domain and, by doing so, engaged in frequent social interactions (i.e., discussing, helping, sharing). Finally, members had to have developed a shared repertoire of resources and created a shared practice. All groups were selforganized, non-mandated, and included inter- and intrauniversity CoP in a variety of formats. As data were collected, additional communities recommended by other participants that met these criteria were included. Communication included face to face meetings for groups composed entirely of members of a single university (5 total groups). For the four remaining groups functioning at a distance, meetings took place via Skype, or at professional conferences and personal visits. In all cases, group members also engaged socially outside the workplace whenever possible. Group size ranged from 2 to 10 with varied goals. Potential participants were contacted via email or in person. All institutional review board procedures were followed. Participating teacher educators provided written informed consent, entailing their willingness to participate in the study.

# 2.2. Data sources

Data sources included formal and informal interviews, field notes, and related artifacts. First, to gain a more in-depth understanding of the CoP, we conducted focus group interviews $( 6 0 { - } 9 0 \ \operatorname * { m i n } )$ with members of seven groups concentrating on participants’ recalled events, people, contexts, and circumstances salient to their collective professional learning experience. Because of timing/convenience, members of two CoP were interviewed individually. Second, descriptive field notes from observations were taken at formal and informal meetings of five of the nine CoP $_ { ( 1 - 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ each), describing teacher educator interactions. Third, informal conversational interviews (Patton, 2002) (average of $^ { 5 \mathrm { h } }$ ; range: $^ { 3 - 9 \ \mathrm { h } ) }$ were conducted with individual CoP members at professional conferences and university, and personal visits. Informal conversational interviews were utilized because they provide, “flexibility, spontaneity, and responsiveness to individual differences and situational changes” (Patton, 2002, p. 342). As such, questions were personalized to deepen communication with participants. Lastly, context for these programs was provided by examining relevant artifacts (i.e., published accounts, documents produced, email correspondence).

# 2.3. Data analysis

Data were analyzed utilizing inductively derived categories from this data set and deductive categories based on a priori constructs from relevant literature. Open, axial, and selective coding (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) were used to interpret data to develop categories representing participants' understandings of their participation in a CoP. During the open and axial coding phase we individually read all interview transcripts several times, making notations in the margins. From each transcript, significant phrases or sentences that pertained directly to professional learning were identified. Also during this phase, analytic memos (Creswell, 2007) were written for each data source to document and enrich the interpretive process. Analytic memos consisted of questions, comments, and ideas about emerging categories. Next, we conceptualized and defined categories of results in terms of their properties and dimensions. To accomplish this, individual analyses were compared, taking turns sharing our insights and challenging each other's interpretations, and making new interpretations where necessary.

In the selective coding phase, we formed themes by relating clusters of data to each other, determining which categories were dominant. This was done by interrogating the initial data categories to determine which category encompassed the most data from the perspectives of all participants. Based on our examination of teacher educator responses, data were originally organized into two major categories and nine subcategories, which after further analysis and discussion were collapsed into six. These categories were then arranged according to procedures suggested by Affara, Brown, and Mangione (2002) to delineate major and minor categories. Because the focus was on the participation in a CoP itself, the specific CoP characteristics (e.g., purpose, goals, location) were not taken into account in data sorting (Creswell, 2007). Finally, newly created codes and categories were scrutinized until analysis produced no new codes or categories and when accounting for all of the data. The most relevant excerpts from each of the categories obtained by inductive coding were integrated to portray how engagement in a CoP combated isolation and promoted professional learning. Therefore, direct quotes were identified from participants’ interviews. Participants are identified by pseudonym.

# 2.4. Trustworthiness

Trustworthiness was established utilizing several separate techniques. First, the triangulation was utilized using multiple investigators and multiple data sources to confirm the findings (Merriam, 2009). Data were triangulated for analytical purposes across data sources (formal/informal interviews and artifacts). Investigator triangulation occurred through the use of two investigators collecting and analyzing data. Next, a researcher journal was kept to purposefully search for variations in participant understandings of their engagement in a learning community (Merriam, 2009). Finally, an audit trail was maintained as a way of a transparent description of the research steps taken from the start of a research project to the development and reporting of findings (Patton, 2002).

# 3. Results

This paper focuses primarily on how participation in a CoP supported teacher educators’ professional development by exploring what significant social dynamics and group processes shaped their participation. Data analysis resulted in two overarching themes: a) three legged stools: better together than apart, and b) paving the way: moving to collaboration.

# 3.1. “Three legged stools”: Better together than apart

Quite simply these teacher educators felt alone and insular in their positions, prompting their engagement in a CoP. More frequently than not comments such as, “I was used to being in an isolated space where I would prepare my teaching, but had limited interaction with anything else” (Martha) and, “I was sort of isolated in my program” (Hilda) permeated conversations regarding academic life. There was a feeling of being alone in a crowd and they just wanted “someone to talk to and work with” (Hilda) or needed “someone who I could talk to as a peer” (Mattie). Two aspects depict how participation in CoP furthered professional development: a) I am not alone, and b) unleashing professional growth.

# 3.1.1. I am not alone

To a large extent, close association with like-minded colleagues or at least colleagues of similar interests served to provide a sounding board, combatting isolation and spawning professional growth and development. When alone it was as if, “You're in an institution and there are not a lot of teacher educators around you or you're in a very small program, how do you develop your practice?” (Dianna). When working in isolation it was easy to wonder, “Am I doing it right; am I doing it wrong?” (Faith). Engagement in shared enterprise helped to foster shared alliances united by mutual interests:

Previously, I wasn't with a group of people who had similar interests to me; so I was isolated in some sense. Now they tried to invite me in, but it wasn't my research area so you just don't fit in … so we couldn't sit down and problematize and work through stuff because there wasn't the understanding or the interest. For me a space where there are people who are interested in what you are doing, where you can actually progress, you can challenge yourself, you can link in with people who are going to help you improve and help you get better. That's what the key thing for me is. (Martha)

Belonging to a group of forward thinking physical education teacher educators was refreshing as it “breathes new life into me, it gives me the passion and enthusiasm to try something new and try something slightly different” (Darlene). It was “just re-energizing” as an overall sense of aloneness was replaced with belonging which nurtured connectedness built on trust and sharing:

We have a deep friendship around what we are currently thinking about. It's so fun to talk because we support each other. We share so much around our academic lives and they [others] don't get it. They don't understand your struggles, your insecurities, but this group does. (Katy)

The belonging bred emotional support enhancing feelings of self-efficacy and assurance. A young academic expressed that the group gave “me confidence in what I know, what I might know” (Hilda). Engagement with the CoP served to shatter the silos of isolation allowing people to get to know one another and initiate conversations that began to negotiate the previous walls of seclusion.

This new-found confidence served to enhance professional engagement that heightened learning, and allowed for unforeseen accomplishments. Initially this professional engagement surfaced as undiscovered opportunities for growth and development as professionals:

I have had the opportunity to get involved in a variety of projects with a variety of people. I would never had worked with Ellen on a project, but because of random conversations that most often happen in the group you start thinking, ‘oh wouldn't that be an interesting project if we linked this to that’ … and so now I am now working with people that I would never have worked with before which is really valuable and without this group that never would have happened. (Martha)

While the CoP at times were with colleagues in the same institution, others functioned at a great distance. Despite the fact that the geographical separateness had the potential to compound feelings of detachment, proximity did not appear to be an issue as one member of a long distance group relayed “despite being thousands of miles away and an 8-h time difference … being a part [of the CoP] helps to fight my sense of isolation, and pushes my thinking as a teacher educator and researcher” (Nathan). Regardless of locale, the groups provided a network, a “secret society” (Hezro), a safety net of sorts, of compatible individuals. There was a clear sense that they were no longer alone.

# 3.1.2. Unleashing professional growth

As a sense of community was built, the CoP provided a platform for professional growth, development, and learning through the interaction with others. While this learning might in certain instances be ordinary information such as “something about the computer or something with the Coke machine” (Molly) which was important to be able to ask, overall it was epitomized as something much larger, deeper, and richer. It was about “who you have become” (Morgan). The group and the interaction it triggered provided a venue that, “really has allowed me to be a learner, to continue to be a learner” (Nathan).

Ultimately, the groups afforded a backdrop to test out knowledge while extending one another's knowledge, “So any time I question myself or my understanding I can kind of bounce that off the group” (Hilda). At the same time, they complemented, “brought different skill sets” (Katy), to each other's knowledge. As Shannon shared when discussing how to infuse technology in to a physical education teaching methods course, “I'm coming with one slant, Jody's coming with another, but overall we are then thinking digital learning and how we can improve our teaching by using this

technology”.

The professional learning for others embodied increasing their professional identity through filling perceived knowledge deficits. For example, Shannon shared how she overcame her limited prior physical education teaching experience when asked to teach elementary methods at the university level, “I couldn't fill those gaps, I knew I couldn't and that's why like straight away, I needed people around me”. At other times the support allowed for the continuation of research activity. As Nathan, who was moving from a research supportive environment to one with a higher teaching focus, stated:

I wanted to continue to do research and present; all those things. I knew that I needed that. And I knew that going to a place where I'm teaching four classes a semester and several of those had extensive field experiences in schools; that was going to be really, really difficult. So I knew I couldn't do it solo. So I knew I needed help.

By uncovering one another's strengths, working together resulted in an effectiveness that could not be found when working alone. One group who was geographically isolated from any other physical education teacher education collective and received all of their knowledge from reading or electronically indicated:

We only survive by ourselves. Together we can gather knowledge, new knowledge. Like from Charlie I got plenty of new knowledge that I never expected before. From Alphonso I got a more philosophical view; from … It's like a puzzle for us. Alphonso will complete me and then Antonio will complete me, and I will complete … (Hezro)

These groups were complementary and interdependent, “like ‘three pronged stools’” (Darlene). “At the end of the day you have a richer mix” with the ideas of one balancing the ideas of others. The bottom line for all was “we need each other”. Quite simply they were better together than apart:

The one thing that we both know; we wouldn't have been here alone. We wouldn't have published the things. We wouldn't have had the projects because we write all projects together. We complement each other in different ways; we have different competences. We do different things better than the other and in different ways. If we would have been doing the same things good and the same things bad they wouldn't have worked as well. (Morgan)

# 3.2. Paving the way: The movement to collaboration

As a result of participation in a CoP, teacher educators collaborated on topics of teaching and research capacities, personal professional learning, and advocacy; topics about which they genuinely cared. While both process and product accomplishments were realized by these groups, significant social dynamics and group processes shaped their practice, paving the way to collaboration. These included: a) identifying a common focus to spark joint work, b) developing professional and personal relationships, c) safe but challenging spaces, and d) shared commitment.

# 3.2.1. Identifying a common focus to spark joint work

Members of CoP were bound together by common practices, and a collectively developed understanding about the focus of the community. Groups came together in various ways as some grew from common research interests identified at academic conferences, others spawned from an interest to improve teacher education in a particular institution or region. The formation of groups was sometimes simply, “Find [ing] someone with some common interest and just talk and talk” (John). Other CoP discussed the importance of beginning with a common task, “I think what keeps us together is we keep having authentic tasks that we decide we're going to engage in; finding the project that in the moment is meaningful” (Katy).

Regardless of their focus, groups shared a concern or a passion for something they did (i.e., research, teaching, advocacy), developed a clear sense of purpose, and worked towards shared facilitation of that purpose through sustained social interaction. When providing advice to someone else with an interest in initiating a similar CoP, Tammy shared the importance of finding common ground:

Find a common focus, whether it be based on research, teaching, students or whatever. Once a focus is determined attempt to pull the group together on an ongoing basis to read about, talk about and explore the area of interest in an in-depth way. This might involve designing new pedagogies to investigate, developing a research question to examine, or designing a way of mentoring one another.

To become formally established, CoP developed a structure for their interactions and, especially early in their development, negotiated boundaries for interaction. One group described how, “First, we created the safe environment over the teacher education piece” (Mattie). It was after the development of this initial common interest that:

We were able to engage in more substantive issues; not that discussion of elementary methods wasn't meaningful, but those [conversations] were relatively safe. After that foundation was established we were able to engage in research, share writing, etcetera. Now we have a strong research collaboration, but that really developed over time. (Nathan)

This progression was echoed by several groups in which the development of a common focus served to provide an initial boundary which defined interactions. One self-study CoP explained that their common focus initially provided a structure around which to share ideas, “So the self-study gave that flexibility as well … delimited, put a boundary around, what we [shared]” (Dianna). This initial structure and break from isolation then served to provide a foundation that allowed “the relationship to talk about things beyond those boundaries” (Tony). Describing this process of negotiating boundaries of the CoP, Dianna stated, “These long distance relationships required negotiation and strategy. Tony is in one country and I'm in another. We had to establish, ‘So here's what will be expected. Here's how it would operate’”.

# 3.2.2. Lasting personal and professional relationships

After determining a joint enterprise and negotiating initial boundaries, building and maintaining meaningful relationships was essential to the development and maturation of groups. This was paramount to creating community and supported CoP to overcome barriers. Relationships were developed initially via informal social interactions:

I can't overstate just how important that informal social interaction is in building relationships. At least until the foundation is laid. That makes a group a lot stronger. That notion of building relationships and building them on safe ground is highly important. It builds trust. Until you know you can trust someone you are certainly not going to share the intimate details of your work with them. (Morgan)

Relationships among group members were nurtured through authentic, organic, often spontaneous conversations where power was a non-issue:

The social aspect is huge. If there is not the opportunity to just walk into somebody's office and have a conversation, then it makes it more difficult. That creates some barriers; you haven't broken the social barrier. Therefore, when you get a whole bunch of people in the same room there are some social and perceived power barriers going on; those prohibit some people from being as open as they want to. (Tammy)

Before these social relationships were developed, interactions within CoP were initially professional in nature. Over time, however, once trust was established they transitioned into something much more significant where potentially contentious ideas or thoughts could be more easily discussed. Field notes of one US intra-university CoP research brainstorming session hosted at a local pub corroborated the establishment of trusting relationships.

As members arrive they are enthusiastically greeted with hugs and smiles by the others. Food and drinks are enjoyed while the group chats about personal and professional topics. As the food arrives one member shares that she is eligible for promotion at her university, yet is apprehensive about submitting her application. Another member quickly responds “just do it!”, sharing that she recently went through the process and offers to share her own materials. Others chime in with their support and offers to read and provide feedback prior to the submission deadline. Once the discussion begins to die down, Donna shares the logistics of the upcoming national presentation and suggests the CoP members submit a proposal. She also suggests including one CoP member who was unable to make the meeting. Discussion ensued and the group negotiated different presentation ideas. They ultimately decide on a topic and decide to work on a formal proposal at their next meeting. (field notes, 4/14/13)

As illustrated in this scenario, the power of relationships among the members was evident. One participant stated, “Yes, just trust, I think that's our power, [Laughter] it's trust” (Anne). Overall, these relationships among the teacher educators were reported to be an essential feature in the process and sustained their efforts. The relationships (both personal and professional) were so powerful that one two-person community was described by a colleague as “the most famous uncouple couple in sport pedagogy” (Informal conversational interview; $2 / 1 5 )$ .

# 3.2.3. Safe but challenging spaces

Due in large part to the development of trusting relationships, CoP were described as a place where new opportunities could be explored in an emotionally safe but challenging space. These environments were places where is was acceptable to say “I can't think; I can't do this; I need help. I need you” (Morgan). It was a space that allowed participants “to learn in a really safe environment and talk about half formed ideas” (Mattie). For Nathan, engagement in a CoP pushed him to take risks he might not ordinarily take,

She's (CoP member) is more creative and I'm much more conservative. She has connections, she knows everybody. She'll go and ask people things that I would never ask in a million years. So as a result, we got access to all of these people, we interviewed these people, visiting them … If it was just me, I don't know if it would have happened.

Once trust was established, CoP meetings provided a venue to learn in a manner consistent with what worked for them. Betty summed up this sentiment well when she stated:

The most significant thing was … creating an environment where I felt safe to talk about things … I was [initially] scared to talk because I didn't think they mattered [laughter]. I think probably because for all these years nobody has ever really challenged me; and being challenged was very, very scary. It was so important for it to be so safe for me to be able to say ‘I don't know what you mean by that’. It was the acknowledgement of the not knowing in that safe environment that made me really think about what I did know and what I could know.

While this may have initially been viewed as risky, it was now commonplace. Observations of an inter-university CoP's research meeting confirmed the learning environment, indicating that when members initially disagreed about the direction of a future research project, they were able to reach consensus after much back and forth discussion about the feasibility of the project and relation of the research topic to group members' interests. Katy explained this negotiation process:

I figured out how I learn. I learn by bouncing off my ideas, as crazy as they might be, by other people and sort of seeing what sticks … when I interact with them it just helps me to get to new places in my thinking.

In creating this safe and challenging space, members were cautious of others' feelings:

We were really careful of each other's feelings. And I guess a little bit you know protective … because the reality is when you type something [email] and you send it off to someone, you're not there to see them crying at their desk. (Dianna)

Respect allowed communities to provide a space where mistakes could be safely discussed and deficits could be recognized without feeling deficient, “For me it's a place to explore and learn; there's no fear. There's no power piece, it's like a level playing field and the trust is huge” (Darlene). Ultimately, members of CoP facilitated a non-judgmental environment in which participants felt confident, safe, and supported.

Safe, however did not always mean comfortable. Meetings provided participants with opportunities to engage in critical discourse which contributed to their learning. These challenging discussions pushed participants to deepen their thinking and provided the confidence to try new things:

She (CoP member) pushes me. She gets me to view things from a different perspective. Our conversations are usually back and forth, ‘What about this, what about that’. Though we often see eye to eye, there are occasions where we flat out disagree; that's where we sometimes have a break-through or a new idea. (Nathan)

Opportunities for teacher educators to be reflective about their teaching, research, and new ideas were also valued. Conversations focused on essential elements of teacher educators' work, including “… broader conversations where you get other perspectives; those that are different from your own” (Anne). Groups created a space where teacher educators gathered to discuss common interests and push individual's thinking:

It's (CoP) a space where there are people who are interested in what you are doing; where you can actually progress; you can challenge yourself; you can link in with people who are going to help you improve and help you get better. (Martha)

Group interactions encouraged participants to use their collective experiences as a means for sharing ideas to increase knowledge and skills. Morgan described that frequent dialog was enjoyable and an essential aspect of his CoP:

It's fun to be able to go in and ask a question, ‘can you read this and can you do that?’ We wouldn't even think about doing it alone. I would never write a paper which nobody had read or submit that which people haven't commented on or send in an application or anything. It wouldn't happen.

# 3.2.4. Shared commitment

There was an unmistakable sense of commitment to others within the CoP. When describing their CoP focused on improving teacher education, it was stated, “Commitment. Commitment to others. Committed individuals. It starts with commitment” (Darlene). As relationships among members were established, participants shared that they made closer connections because of their work together Katy spoke about her commitment:

And then just a practical piece is that when we commit to something we do not let each other down. If we say we are going to do something, you're going to do it. I don't think anyone in this group has every let me down.

At a foundational level commitment represented an accountability to complete tasks in a timely manner. But, for these groups it was more than that:

For me, truly being part of a group means you are committed. Committed to the project but also committed to others. If I know, for example we are meeting on Friday to share what we have worked on; I will do everything I can to contribute. Even if it has been a crazy week and time is short, ‘I will have something to share’. But if I'm doing that alone, I know – it just wouldn't have happened. (Nathan)

Scheduling time purposefully was also a characteristic of the CoP studied, especially those with members who were at a distance. Meetings, generally Skype calls were conducted much like regular face to face meetings. A day and time were set, an agenda drafted, and they were “never less than an hour and a half I'd say. Like I've learned not to do it … just before dinner” (Dianna). Sessions maintained some social sense, but tended to be:

. very productive when we do talk. And we're fairly directed in that … we mapped it out quite well so we needed to do that abstract for an upcoming conference. We know already this next abstract's going here and we know that paper needs to be written or revised. So we're fairly structured and organized. And I guess we prioritize it as well. (Dianna)

One participant described that to be committed to the group, “The key is we have to make some sacrifice” (Alphonso). This willingness to make sacrifices and remain committed to the other members of the CoP was a consistent feature among groups which allowed participants to move from isolation to collaboration.

# 4. Discussion

This study explored physical education teacher educators' understandings of how their participation in a CoP supported their own professional development More specifically, significant dynamics and group processes of CoP were examined. The groups studied reflect Wenger and Wenger-Trayner’s (2015) assertion that CoP can and do vary in terms of size, geographic location, and fundamental purpose. To be included in the study, CoP demonstrated Wenger and Wenger-Trayner’s (2015) three elements of domain, community, and practice. Even the two very small CoP included adhered to these criteria and all were formed by individuals who engaged in a process of collective learning in a share domain of human endeavor. Regardless of specific characteristics, in all instances participation in a CoP served to break isolation and support professional development. Engagement provided a foundation for collaboration, allowing participants to extend teaching and research capacities.

In the unpacking of the ‘intracacies of these communities, professional learning and growth, like the work of Hadar and Brody (2010), appeared scaffolded and was ‘more than working together’. Adhering to situated learning, trust and respect among members was paramount (Whitcomb et al., 2009). As such, members successfully engaged by listening and being respectful of different opinions. This finding is dissimilar to studies reporting that relationships and collaboration based on contrived collegiality, congeniality, and power, can be a major roadblock (Hargreaves, 1992; Owen, 2015). Participants in this study successfully negotiated and established genuine trust and respect within a safe and supportive environment in which members were more willing to take risks (Whitcomb et al., 2009), engaging in challenging discourse that pushed them to deepen their understanding and attempt new practices was created. This environment led to enhanced confidence, resulting in increased risk-taking. For example, participants indicated that engagement in a CoP was intellectually challenging, yet felt safe. Varying viewpoints were seen as enhancing the learning process. Often this process resulted in new collaborations and frequently informed each other's research and teaching. Although participants regularly engaged with colleagues on a departmental or programmatic level, they infrequently engaged with colleagues in discourse about research, teaching practice, or student learning. Our results emphasize professional development within a group of teacher educators which stands in stark contrast to the solitary academic, whose professional learning is partitioned from regular work. This perspective supports breaking a higher education culture of isolation and is driven by the belief that, “one cannot learn in a vacuumdbeing an expert novice” has limited capacities (Brown, 1997, p.412).

For meaningful professional development to occur, supportive conditions that allow teacher educators “to freely share experiences, attitudes, concepts” (Ben-Perez, Kleeman, Reichenberg, & Shimoni, 2010, p. 123) must be present. Like Hadar and Brody (2010), the importance of the initial development of relationships and the social nature of learning as a prerequisite to the discussion of more substantive topics was vital. Teacher educators in this study created the necessary structural and human supportive environment to facilitate intentional collaborative learning and the application of that learning (Hord & Tobia, 2012), thus paving the way for professional growth and development. While these structural and human supportive conditions were necessary, they were not sufficient circumstances for learning. Instead, it was supportive conditions coupled with a common identified focus, safe but challenging spaces, and shared commitment that allowed for the process of professional development to occur. In turn, participants moved from isolation to collaboration, realizing Hadar and Brody's third level benefits of new dispositions toward teaching and research.

Hadar and Brody suggest that it is the break in isolation which leads to improved teaching and ultimately increased confidence. For the participants in this study, increased confidence came earlier as they began to engage with colleagues (reducing isolation) and it was the increased confidence which led to recognizing potential. For example, results of the current study indicated that the emotional support provided by the CoP enhanced their feelings of self-efficacy, assuring their efforts to learn and explore new teacher education practices.

Engagement with CoP supported teacher educators to get to know one another and initiate meaningful conversations, resulting in confidence building. Finding their voices in a safe and, at times, challenging space subsequently allowed increased interaction to occur. With these groups it appeared that the more social dynamics and group process aspects (e.g., shared commitment, safe and uncomfortable space, personal and professional relationships, common focus), what might be considered environmental or organizational factors, were attended to the more potential there was for the breaking personal isolation. Hence the more potential for professional learning and growth.

In the end, participants' understandings of how their participation in a CoP served to further their professional development were remarkably similar. Though not a primary focus of this investigation, the analogous responses from teacher educators suggest that there was little variation in results with respect to faculty rank, group's purpose, and geographic location. Interestingly, roughly half of the CoP examined involved teacher educators from different institutions prompting several questions about the value and acceptance of inter versus intra university CoP. By bringing ‘another set of eyes’ to discussions, these groups, enhanced, rather than detracted from work in their home institutions as group members became ‘defacto’ contributors to another faculty. In the end, these CoP effectively functioned despite representing a variety of structures (face to face and at a distance; inter and intra university). Regular, often informal, interactions were valued and when typical meetings were not possible, as was the case for groups with members in more than one location, groups instead utilized technology as well as professional conferences and personal visits to engage. Perhaps more important to the participants in this study than rank or location, was that engagement in CoP resulted in the creation of trusting relationships which served to break their feeling of academic isolation. While safe, CoP members frequently engaged in critical dialog which challenged the status quo. This type of disequilibrium has been identified as an effective means to facilitate learning (Fosnot, 2005). Teacher educators in this study challenged each other's thinking, successfully introducing disequilibrium all the while creating an environment in which teachers felt safe, supported, and able to take chances in a non-judgmental setting.

Loughran (2014) submits that teacher educators, “be able to conceptualize and enact their own professional learning” (p. 273) requiring “a vision for professional development that affords them agency in the active development of their scholarship” (p. 280). For these teacher educators this was done through meaningful engagement in a CoP. As such, we are not proposing CoP as a recipe for action or panacea for teacher educators' professional learning. In fact, from our experience there is no one recipe for the creation and maintenance of CoP. The CoP investigated in this study were as different as the people who comprised them. While no ‘magic bullet’, we offer the tenets of effective CoP including, the identification of a common focus to spark joint work, developing professional and personal relationships (created during professional and social interactions), creating safe (non-judgmental) but challenging spaces, and developing shared commitment. For these participants and in these instances, CoP with these characteristics not only broke isolation and the competitive norms of higher education, but provided a collaborative environment where faculty were committed to their own learning, inspiring institutional growth (Graff, 1996; Hadar & Brody, 2010).

Similar to learning communities which have being proposed as a signature pedagogy (Shulman, 2005) for teachers' professional learning (Parker, Patton & O’Sullivan, 2016), CoP have been identified as a potential signature pedagogy for teacher educators professional learning (Ben-Perez et al., 2010). In response to Lawson’s (1991) call for the investigation of the paradigmatic and occupational communities to which physical education teacher educators belong, this study examined participants' understandings of how their participation in a CoP supported their own professional development and served to enhance a culture of collaboration.

Faculty in higher education institutions often function in silos; yet such segregation is not good for the individual, the university, or the profession. The CoP examined in this study appear to mediate the isolationist culture of the university, allowing individual faculty control over the quality of his or her academic life. In such instances, learning is motivated and expanded when individuals “participate in the collective control over the conditions of their learning” (Roth & Lee, 2006, p. 38). These teacher educators have shown us that working together is effective; that the cooperative is a place where ideas belong to the group and where learning is promoted and valued. We also believe that the practices of teacher educators “influence the work of teachers, which in turn influences the success of pupils (Kosnik et al., 2015, p.219). This compels the rethinking of the organization and structure of professional learning in higher education, calling into question the necessity for meaningful reflection for true transformation in teacher education professional learning and practice. Such CoP hold the potential develop more than a culture of collaboration and provide a vehicle for individuals to extend teaching and research capacities, thus enhancing both teacher education and research on teacher education. A consequence of this type of professional learning could be teacher education programs that result in educational change (Loughran, 2014).
