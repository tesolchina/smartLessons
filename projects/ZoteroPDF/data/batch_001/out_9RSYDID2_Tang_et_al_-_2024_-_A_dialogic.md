# ABSTRACT

This paper explores the pedagogical potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in secondary education through a dialogic approach to teaching, learning and assessment. It presents an ongoing action research project in collaboration with a high school in Western Australia, involving four teachers to integrate GenAI in their classrooms. The study aims to develop and evaluate innovative pedagogies for leveraging GenAI to enhance educational practices and student learning outcomes across three action research teams focusing on critical questioning, assessment and differentiation. Drawing on Bakhtin’s concept of heteroglossia, the study conceptualizes GenAI not as a definitive knowledge provider but as a dialogic agent that facilitates collaborative dialogue and co-construction of knowledge among students. This perspective aims to encourage students to critically engage with AIgenerated content and integrate multiple viewpoints into their learning, thus fostering key epistemic skills. Initial findings demonstrate active student engagement in dialogues with GenAI, highlighting the use of follow-up questions that indicate critical thinking and creativity. These findings underscore the significance of integrating multiple perspectives and fostering epistemic skills among students, promoting a comprehensive and ethical approach to AI use in education. The research calls for further exploration of GenAI’s pedagogic potential and its broader implications for educational practices, suggesting a promising avenue for pedagogical innovation and the development of critical thinking skills in the digital age.

# Introduction

The introduction of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT has raised challenging questions about the nature of teaching, learning, and assessment in schools and universities. With the ability to instantly generate original content, GenAI is predicted to transform and reshape the way we learn, think, and work. Maini and Sabri (2017) argue $^ { \prime \prime } { \sf A l }$ will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. Anyone who does not understand it will soon find themselves feeling left behind” (p.3). However, education research and practice are currently ill-prepared to address the unprecedented disruption caused by this emerging technology in schools and classrooms. As such, there is an urgent need for empirical research investigating and documenting the use of GenAI in K-12 classrooms. There is also a need to explore, develop and test innovative pedagogies integrating GenAI in lesson and assessment activities.

This paper presents an ongoing research project that aims to explore innovative approaches to teaching, learning and assessment with GenAI in secondary education. Through a partnership with a high school in Western Australia, four teachers engaged in a collaborative action research with the researchers to enact novel lesson activities and assessment tasks involving the use of GenAI. The research objectives were to develop proof of concepts illustrating the use of GenAI in secondary school and evaluate student learning gains through the process. The overarching research questions that guided the design of the action research were:

(1) What are novel ways of using GenAI to support teaching and learning practices in secondary school?   
(2) What are the benefits and challenges to student learning associated with the use of GenAI?

# Theoretical perspective: generative AI as dialogic agent

The research in this project adopts a theoretical perspective that views GenAI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, not as authoritative solution providers, but as dialogic agents in educational settings. This perspective is grounded in Bakhtin’s (1981) concept of heteroglossia, which posits that language use is inherently dialogic, interweaving multiple voices and perspectives within the chain of speech communication. Our theoretical perspective extends the concept of heteroglossia to the realm of GenAI, recognizing its role in facilitating collaborative dialogue and co-construction of knowledge.

Tang (2024) has argued that GenAI, particularly LLMs, may exemplify heteroglossia in two distinct ways. Firstly, as LLMs are trained on diverse data sources, the juxtaposition of these sources and their embedded voices produces language that, while lacking human intentionality and consciousness, represents a complex amalgamation of human expression. This process can be seen as a form of “appropriation” (Bakhtin, 1981) of human language, where the AI’s voice is essentially a compilation of numerous human inputs. Secondly, the interaction between users and GenAI is a dynamic co-construction of knowledge. Consistent with Bakhtin’s view that no utterance or written text exists in isolation outside a chain of texts, the output from GenAI is a result of a continuous interplay between the user’s creative input and the AI’s data-derived responses.

Viewing GenAI as a dialogic agent rather than a definitive source of knowledge provider emphasizes the negotiated and evolving nature of understanding. This approach has the potential to foster development of key epistemic skills among students. Students learn to value the integration of multiple viewpoints, including AI-generated insights, in their learning process. Additionally, this perspective redistributes epistemic authority from technology to the broader community of knowers, underscoring the importance of human expertise in validating and contextualizing knowledge. By framing GenAI as a dialogic partner through a pedagogic innovation, this approach encourages and supports students to develop a critical stance towards technological solutions, including the use of GenAI. Students are guided to assess AI responses critically and to contextualize them within their academic discourse. This approach also highlights the responsible and ethical use of AI tools in academic contexts, promoting an understanding that knowledge production is inherently a social and contextualized process.

# Methods

# Research context

This research project employs a collaborative action research methodology (Ferrance, 2000) to design and enact innovative pedagogies, while simultaneously collecting data to inform and evaluate the pedagogical development. A collaborative action research is characterized by a partnership between the research team and a group of teachers keen to explore the use of GenAI in their classrooms. It also involves iterative and reflective cycles of planning, acting, observing, and reflecting (McAteer, 2013). This approach is particularly well-suited to the current study, as it enables ongoing development and testing of novel approaches involving GenAI in actual classroom settings. Involving teachers and students as co-researchers, action research also assists in exploring and addressing localized issues specific to the use of GenAI in their educational environments. Consequently, the participatory nature of action research deepens the understanding of GenAI’s impact on teaching and learning for all stakeholders – researchers, teachers and students alike.

Several independent schools in Western Australia interested in introducing GenAI into the classrooms were invited to participate in our research project. Public schools were not included due to a prevailing ban on GenAI at the time of the research. Subsequently, one all-boys school, along with four teachers, volunteered to participate in the study. The teachers were grouped into three action research (AR) teams, each focusing on different applications of GenAI for (a) critical questioning, (b) assessment and (c) differentiation. Guided by a shared understanding of GenAI’s dialogic and co-constructed nature, the researchers and teachers met several times within their respective AR teams to co-design lesson activities and data collection instruments involving ChatGPT. Each teacher subsequently selected one of their classes to participate in the study. This study adhered to the ethical considerations and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Curtin University (Project number: HRE2023–0413).

Data sources for this study included students’ chat logs with ChatGPT, students’ artefacts (both formative and summative assessments), and interviews with students and teachers. The chat logs provided a direct record of student interactions with ChatGPT, offering valuable insights into their usage and learning outcomes. Student interviews revealed their perceptions and experiences, while teacher interviews shed light on instructional strategies and encountered challenges. For the critical questioning AR team, another key data source was video observations of three lessons with intensive ChatGPT usage in the classroom. These video records allowed for the capture and analysis of rich classroom dynamics and student engagement with ChatGPT. Triangulating these data sources allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the studied phenomena and enhanced the study’s validity.

# Design of GenAI pedagogy and intervention

The design of the intervention was developed according to the following learning objectives, subject areas, grade levels and learning environments in each AR team:

# Critical questioning

The objective of the intervention was to foster critical questioning (Mayweg-Paus et al., 2016) by enabling students to prompt GenAI with questions and critically evaluate the responses in terms of their relevance, accuracy and bias. This intervention was carried out with a teacher in a Grade 10 English class through two iterative phases. In the first phase, students used ChatGPT to research on the historical and social context surrounding a poem of their choice. In the second phase, the students asked ChatGPT to take on the persona of a Shakespearean character in order to answer their questions for that character.

# Assessment

The objective of the assessment intervention was to investigate the practicalities of implementing assessment practices and to reveal the enablers and barriers to using GenAI in assessment both from a formative and a summative perspective with two Grade 8 Humanities teachers. These issues have been discussed by Kulkarni et al. (2022), however, there is little in the literature around applying GenAI in assessment in lower secondary schools. The project involved working with two teachers to redesign and implement two previously used assessment pieces. In both cases, students critically examined any responses resulting from interactions with ChatGPT and showed how these interactions contributed to their final assessment product.

# Differentiation

This intervention aimed to explore the potential of generative AI to facilitate differentiated instruction (Gibbs & Beamish, 2021) in the classroom. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, teachers can tailor their instructional approaches to meet the diverse needs of students. Generative AI can provide personalized learning experiences by adapting content, materials, and instructional methods to match students’ readiness, interests, and learning preferences. The research also emphasizes dialogic interactions with GenAI in line with different levels of thinking supported using educational technology (Palieraki & Koutrouba, 2021).

# Findings

For the purpose of this paper, findings from the first phase of the critical questioning AR are reported here to illustrate a lesson activity that was aligned with the dialogic approach of using ChatGPT as a dialogic and co-construction agent.

The analysis for this report was guided by the following specific research questions:

(a) How was ChatGPT used in the classroom? (b) How were students interacting with ChatGPT?

# How was ChatGPT used in the classroom? Interpretation from video observation

The teacher used ChatGPT as a tool to enhance students’ critical questioning and factchecking skills. He guided his students through a structured process of engaging AIgenerated responses as a dialogue by posing follow-up questions to continue the conversation. He also emphasized the importance of not blindly accepting AI-generated information and encouraged them to verify the accuracy of the responses through additional research. The following video observation during the first lesson illustrates this dialogic emphasis of using GenAI:

At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher explained the purpose of using GenAI to customise the learning experience for the students and the importance of factchecking AI responses. He directed their attention to four major steps of using GenAI he had written on the whiteboard (See Figure 1) and emphasized, “These are the steps that I would go through to make sure that you’re not just taking the first thing that [ChatGPT] spits out to you.”

After the teacher had elaborated the steps, he provided a modelling by using an example of poems by Wilfred Owen. He showed his own dialogue with ChatGPT on the screen, emphasizing some of the follow-up questions he asked after the first response. It must be stressed that his example was shown briefly and the teacher did not explain his follow-up questions to the students. Subsequently, the students were given time for the rest of the lesson to start researching about the poet of their choice and prompting the AI for information about them.

# StEps:

1.  Pose the question:.

Can you please provide some insight into the context of focusing on the issue of

2.Critical thinking: Double check your answers? Is it accurate?.

3.Prompt further:. Create the conversation.. Ask follow-up questions.. Lean on, and add in, the knowledge you already have..

4. Summarise in your own words.

# How were students interacting with ChatGPT? Interpretation from students’ chat with GenAI

From a class size of 16 students attending the observed lesson, 10 students’ chats with ChatGPT were collected and analysed according to the type of questions they posed. On average, each student posted 3.6 questions in each chat, thus yielding a total of 36 student questions. To analyse the chat as a conversation consisting of a sequence of question-answer exchanges, we first distinguished between the initial question and the subsequent follow-up questions within every chat. Figure 2 shows an example of a chat from a student consisting of an initial question, responses from ChatGPT 3.5, and subsequent follow-up questions. The figure also shows how we coded and distinguished between Expand and Elaborate as two types of follow-up questions.

Based on this initial distinction, we identified 13 initial questions, 20 follow-up questions and 3 questions unrelated to the poetry task. There were more initial questions (13) than number of students (10) due to two students initiating multiple chat sessions with ChatGPT. Further analysis of the 20 follow-up questions revealed five distinct types that we call: Elaborate, Expand, Contextualise, Verify and Clarify. Informed by Bakhtin’s (1981) work on heteroglossia, these question types cannot be solely identified based on their linguistic structure, but must be interpreted within the context of an ongoing “chain of utterances”. Table 1 provides descriptions and examples of each question type, while Figure 3 presents the distribution of the 20 follow-up questions posed by the 10 students.

The various follow-up questions serve different discursive functions in driving conversations with GenAI and are equally important as dialogic elements. For instance, while Elaborate, Expand and Contextualize questions contribute to the continuity of dialogue, they differ in terms of how they advance the conversation. Elaborate questions delve deeper into a topic as they push for more specificity, Expand questions introduce new perspectives or subtopics, and Contextualize questions seek background information to grasp the context of an issue. Moreover, Verify and Clarify questions serve as “epistemic devices” (Settlage & Southerland, 2019) to check information rather than generating further information. However, they also have distinct purposes; Verify questions assess the validity of external sources, while Clarify questions target a person’s internal interpretation, akin to a metacognitive monitoring of understanding (c.f. Fox & Riconscente, 2008).

The results from Table 1 and Figure 3 show there was a range of follow-up questions posed by the students as they interacted with ChatGPT to explore their chosen poems, although there was an uneven distribution with a greater emphasis on elaborating type of questions. To some extent, this range of follow-up questions aligns with the teacher’s pedagogical objective of wanting the students to actively “create the conversation” (see Figure 1) with GenAI. Importantly, most of the students’ follow-up questions were not mere replicas of the teacher’s modelled questions that he provided during the lesson, suggesting that the students exhibited some creativity and critical thinking skills in formulating their own inquiries to engage GenAI in meaningful conversations.

# Discussion

The findings from the first AR team in this project provide an illustration of what ChatGPT can be used for to promote desirable education outcomes, notably critical questioning.

Figure 2. An example of a student prompting GenAI’s responses.

Although the small sample size within an all-boys independent school precludes any form of generalization, the objective of this study is to explore innovative pedagogy of integrating GenAI in classroom activities by framing GenAI as a dialogic partner and knowledge co-constructor. This dialogic approach was exemplified in the observed class with the teacher’s instructional focus of “creating the conversation” and “asking follow-up questions”. The range of follow-up questions posed by the students further illustrated the kind of interactions that resulted from this dialogic approach. Furthermore, this study illuminated how the different types of follow-up questions (Elaborate, Expand, Verify, Contextualize, Clarify) provided different dialogic functions for the students to drive the conversations with GenAI. The findings from this study thus provide a proof of concept for a dialogic approach in steering students away from treating GenAI as an authoritative knowledge provider to a dialogic and co-construction partner.

More research is needed to investigate the potential of the pedagogic innovations further. For critical questioning, the range of follow-up questions identified in Table 1 is not exhaustive and there is scope for future research to identify new types of follow-up questions in other contexts, notably in relation to different topics, subject areas and nature of investigations. There is also a need to find out what kind of pedagogical conditions could lead students to ask more follow-up questions in terms of quantity, quality and originality. As for assessment and differentiation with

GenAI, ongoing work and analysis in our AR project may yield further understanding of how GenAI can be used more holistically to support other educational practices. Finally, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of GenAI’s impact, future research should aim to incorporate a more diverse selection of schools and student populations.

The findings of this research project have significant implications for education research and practice. Firstly, the proof of concept in this paper demonstrates the value of a dialogic approach that utilizes GenAI for teaching and learning, and further prompts the need to expand the approach across different educational contexts and subject areas. It also calls for further development of theoretical and pedagogical frameworks to evaluate the impact of GenAI interventions on student engagement and learning across all subject areas. As GenAI technology continues to evolve, ongoing collaboration among researchers, school leaders, and teachers will be crucial in harnessing its educational potential.

In practical terms, the study also points to the possibility for educators to embrace GenAI as a tool for pedagogical innovation, particularly in fostering critical thinking and collaborative knowledge construction among students. This approach could significantly influence policy and curriculum development, viewing GenAI as a beneficial educational partner rather than a disruptive force. Establishing a research-informed pedagogy that promotes responsible and ethical AI use in the classrooms, instead of banning it, will be pivotal in preparing students for a future increasingly shaped by these technologies. In sum, through the integration of GenAI in innovative pedagogies, educators can harness the potential of GenAI to enhance teaching and learning while upholding ethical and responsible AI use in education.
