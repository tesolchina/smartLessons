Keywords: Graphical abstracts Experimental research articles Rhetorical move-step analysis Take-home messages

Graphical abstracts (GAs) have recently emerged as an add-on genre of experimental research articles (ERAs) in STEM fields. This study used Swales' (1990, 2004) framework to analyze GAs' move and step structures and investigated how they were influenced by ERAs' take-home messages. Our corpus comprised 110 GAs from 55 high-impact journals across 11 STEM disciplines. Thirty-three specialist informants played a dominant role in identifying ERAs' take-home messages, GAs' IMRD moves, and the specific steps realizing those moves. Our findings revealed that GAs' move and step structures, along with their frequently used moves and steps, are significantly influenced by ERAs three distinct types of take-home messages: (1) exploration of new phenomena and/or mechanisms, (2) introduction of new methodologies, and (3) development of new products. GAs tend to fulfill a highlight-to-attract purpose by focusing on ERAs' main scientific contributions, in contrast to the verbal and video abstracts that fulfill a summarize-to-attract purpose by reproducing ERAs' full IMRD structure. Our findings enrich the current understanding of GAs' rhetorical structures and have practical implications for genre-based GA design and pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

The advent of digital technologies has dramatically transformed the scientific publishing landscape, accelerating the dissemination of research findings to diversified audience. This evolution can be manifested by the proliferation of electronic journals and online academic publishers (Gu & Blackmore, 2016), whose survival depends more and more on battig for \*consumers rather than readers" (Hendges & Florek, 2019, p. 60). This competitive landscape extends to scientific authors as well. As the participation in global interactions is increasingly becoming a prerequisite for academic promotion and job security (Hyland, 2009), scientific authors are competing not only for research spaces but also for readership and research visibilit. Perhaps as a response to such heightened competition, academic publishers and authors are progressively seking ways t harness the afordances ofered by digital media to promote their experimental research articles (ERAs). Following Elsevier's The Article of the Future initiative in 2009, a variety of "academic promotional genres" (Wang, 2023, p. 1) has emerged, including author summaries (Breze, 2016), research highlights (Akbas & Farnia, 2021; Malmir et al., 2019; Yang, 2016), Biger Picture (Katsampoxaki-Hodgetts, 2022), teaser-abstracts (Sancho-- Guinda, 2015), plain language summaries (Kuehne & Olden, 2015; Stoll et al., 2022), audioslides (Yang, 2017), video abstracts (Plastina, 2017; Spicer, 2014), and graphical abstracts (GAs) (Florek & Hendges, 2023; Sancho-Guinda, 2015; Yoon & Chung, 2017) These digital genres are increasingly integrated into online ERAs and have been conceptualized as ERAs' add-on genres (Aalbersberg et al., 2012; Harmon, 2019), which use various semiotic modes afforded by digital technology, fulfil dfferent communicative purposes, and target audience with varying degrees of scientific knowledge.

Computer-mediated communication is inherently multimodal (Herring, 2019). When composing ERA add-on genres, authors have the opportunity to orchestrate various semiotic modes (verbal, aural, visual) to achieve different communicative purposes. Existing studies of multimodal add-on genres have mainly focused on video abstracts, audioslides, and GAs. For instance, Plastina (2017) conducted a comparative study of video and printed medical abstracts, reveling that al basic moves of traditional verbal abstracts are still preset, supplemented by the integration of discursive elements from conference presentations and interviews to beter engage their audience. Converely, when analyzing the rhetorical structure and personal pronouns used in hard science audioslides, Yang (2017) discovered that, contrary to Elsevier's recommendations, presenters tend to emphasize more on the knowledge gaps and research design of their ERAs rather than on the findings, and use personal pronouns more for authorial identity projection rather than audience engagement. Notably, as Haner (2018) mentioned, unlike static visual genres (e.g., the GA), audiovisual genres like video abstracts and audioslides greatly rely on \*moving images' (p. 37) and linear narratives to realize their storytelling functions.

GA is a static stand-alone image whose communicative purpose is to give researchers "an immediate understanding of the take home message of the paper' (Cell Press, 2018). This visual approach, by capturing ERA's content at a single glance, can help readers quickly identify the papers most relevant to ther reearch and potentially enance the romotional eficiency of the traditional verbal abstract (Elsevier, 2022). Existing studies on the communicative purpose of GAs have highlighted their role in encapsulating ERAs' "main findings" (Yoon & Chung, 2017, p. 1371), \*main ideas" (Lane et al., 2015, p. 1), and"scientifi ontributions" (Hullman & Bach, 2018 p. 183). Despit thee different teminologies, they ll poin t h simiar fundmentl aspect, that i, GAs abit tsil and communicate ERAs \*take-home messages' (Hendges & Florek, 2019, p. 66). However, while GAs are increasingly used in ERAs, particularly in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, a clear and consistent definition of what exactly constitutes the take-home messages i stll lacking, lt alone catgorizing these meaes acros various SE ERAs and exploring how their diversity may influence the information presented and organized in GAs, namely, the GAs' rhetorical structure.

Building on Todorov's (1976) principle that \*a new genre is always the transformation of one or several old genres' (p. 161), GAs have been seen as a genre drawing from two existing ERA elements:scientific images and traditional verbal abstracts (Hendges & Florek, 2019; Lane et al., 2015). In previous research, GAs have been primarily viewed through the former lens, analyzed and categorized based on their visual elements and design patterns, including their layout design, visual-verbal relationship, types of visual representations, mage originalit, visual metdiscourse, and mediated contexts ., Hendges & Florek, 2019; Hullman & Bach, 2018; Lane et al., 2015; Sancho-Guinda, 2017, 2021; Yo0n & Chung, 2017). These studies have enriched our understanding of GAs' visual design principles. However, they have largely failed to consider GAs as a successor to traditional verbal abstracts, neglecting to investigate their rhetorical structure-a crucial aspect in the studies about astracts (e.g., Bazerman, 198; Bhatia, 193; Feak & Swales, 2009; Hyland, 2004; Myers, 1989; Swales, 1990).

The limited rhetorical analyses of GAs have predominantly applied the Inroduction-Methods--Results-Discussion (IMRD) structure (e.g., Bhatia, 1993; Brenton, 1996; Swales, 1990, 2004),commonly found in verbal abstracts and ERAs, to investigate the underlying move structure of GAs. Sancho-Guinda (2022) observed that GAs often exhibit a form of rhetorical incompletenes, implying that it is relatively rare to find GAs representing the complete IMRD narrative sequence. This view was corroborated by Florek and Hendges (2023), who examined the move structure of 100 GAs in chemistry and medicine disciplines. Through an eval. uation of the moves ocurrence frequencies, which has been a key aspect of genre studies (e.g., Flowerdew & Dudley-Evans, 2002; Kanoksilapatham, 2005; Nwogu, 1997), Florek and Hendges (2023) identified several discipline-specific obligatory move(s)-the Results move in chemistry GAs, and the Methods--ResultsConclusion move sequence in medicine GAs. Similarly, Yon and Chung (2017) found that, in social sciences, the Background, Methods, and Results move can each independently constitute a GA. Together, these studies indicate that GAs' move structure tends to be inherently incomplete, and might be influenced by the conventions of specific disciplines. However, they may overlook a crucial aspect, that is, even within a single discipline, the ERAs could convey different types of take-home messages. ince GAs' communicative purpose is to highlight ERAs' main outcome and novelty so as to encourage further reading, the diversity of these take-home messages could potentiall influence which move(s) of ERAs are selected to display in their corresponding GAs. Therefore, our study seks to systematcally categorize the take-home messages conveyed by ERAs, and then explore the influence of their variations on GAs move structures. Next, the above GA rhetorical analyses have utilized the IMRD framework to investigate GAs move structures, yet have not identified the specific teps constituting each move. To provide practical instructions for scientific authors, who may lack formal training in visual communication but are increasingly responsible for creating GAs it is essential to describe both levels of move and step, because compared with a single level scheme, such dual level scheme has bee considrd morefftive for pedagogical purpose (ang & Alliso, 2003). To fil in the gap, our study aims to utilize Swales' (1990, 2004) framework to analyze not only the move structures but also the step structures within GAs. Moreover, we will identify the frequently used moves and steps in the GA genre by evaluating their occurrence frequencies.

Sancho-Guinda (2015) also applied the IMRD model to explore GAs move structure. However, she distinguished herself from Yoon and Chung (2017) and Florek and Hendges (2023) by incorporating pecialist informants experts in the disciplines related to the GA studied. This method, proposed by Selinker (1979), Huckin and Olsen (1984), Bley-Vroman and Selinker (1984), and employed in the rhetorical move-step analyses of full-length ERAs (e.g., Maswana et al., 2015; Stller & Robinson, 2013), is especially critical for analyzing the move and step structures within GAs. It relies heavily on the technical expertise and visual literacy of the specialist informants, which ensures maximally the accurate interpretation of visual meanings and correct identification of the transitions be. tween different moves and steps (Hendges & Florek, 2019; Sancho-Guinda, 202). Sancho-Guinda's (2015) study surprisingly pointed to the fuzy delimitation of moves and blurriness of move oundarie in GAs, suggesting that the GA genre was to \*fluid and insecure" (Kress, 2010, p. 130) to be regulated by a canonical rhetorical stucture. There are, however, three primary methodological limitations that could raise questions about her conclusion, indicating a need for further genre-based GA studies. First, the power of study was compromised by its limited sample size, with the specialist informants only examining 3 out of 16 GA models from Elsevier's website. Second, among the 3 GA models examined, two were related to ERAs, whil the third was associated to review articl. This variation inthe article types may cause diffculties i applying the traditional RD move tructure for analyzing ther respective GAs. Third, the informants could not be technically rerred to as secialis since they did not come from the same discourse communities as the target GAs, with the GAs from the fields of Clinical Medicine, Biology & Biochemistry, and Materials Science respectively, while the 23 informants including 9 aeronautical engineers, 6 physicists, 3 chemist, 3 mathematicians, and 2 industrial engineers To overcome these methodological limitations, our study will include 33 specialist informants in the true sense, who wil play a dominant role in analyzing the move and step structures of 110 GAs sourced from ERAs across 11 STEM disciplines.

Based on the research background and gaps discussed above, the current study aims to utilize Swales (1990, 2004) framework to investigate the move and step structures of 110 GAs acros11 sTEM disciplines, and to analyze their relationship to the types of take-home messages of their corresponding ERAs. Specifically, we seek to answer the following research questions:

What are the move and step structures of GAs across the STEM fields? Are they influenced by the specific types of take-home messages conveyed by their corresponding ERAs? If yes, in what way?

# 2. Material and methods

# 2.1. GA corpus

Eleven STEM disciplines categorized by Clarivate (2020), except Mathematics, were chosen for this study, including Agricultural Sciences (AS), Biology & Biochemistry (BB), Chemistry (chem), Clinical Medicine (CM), Computer Science (CS), Engineering (engr), Environment/Ecology (EE), Geosciences (GS), Materials Science (MS), Physics (phys), and Plant & Animal Science (PA). These disciplines were selected for their extensive use of GAs (Hullman & Bach, 2018; Lane et al., 2015; Pferschy-Wenzig et al., 2016) and their common adoption of the IMRD move structure in ERAs. Mathematics was excluded due to its infrequent use of GAs (Perez-Llantada, 2013) and it tendency to publish logical arumentation papers rather than experimental ones (Bondi, 199; Mcloskey, 1994; Tarone et al., 1998).

Fifty-five GA-publishing journals were selected, with 5 journals from each of the 11 sTEM disciplines (Appendix A). These journals had the top-5 impact factors among all GA-publishing journals in their respective fields (Clarivate, 2020), ensuring that the GAs featured in them represented "expert performance" (Bazerman, 1994, p. 131) within the GA genre.

Two hundred and seventy-five GAs were randomly selected to build our initial GA corpus, with 5 GAs per journal and 25 GAs per discipline. They were all (1) published between Jan $1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ , and Dec $3 1 ^ { \mathrm { s t } }$ , 2021, representing the current trend of GA use; (2) stand-alone images with the names "graphical astract, "astract graphics, "visual astract" or "eral llustration on the wesite of selected journals; and (3 corrsponding to ERAs with the conventional IMRD move structure. Out of this initial corpus, 110 GAs were selected by our 33 specialist informants (3 informants per discipline, see detailed demographic information in Appendix B), who each chose 2-5 GAs that best aligned with their areas of expertise. Our final corpus comprised 10 GAs from each discipline and 110 GAs in total (Appendix D).

# 2.2. Analysis procedure

On a weekly basis, a video-recorded meeting, either in person or online, was held between the first author and 3 specialist in. formants from the same discipline. A week prior to the meeting, the first author e-mailed two pre-recorded, $2 0 { \cdot } \mathrm { m i n }$ videos to the 3 informants: One explained several key concepts of genre analys including genre, move, and step following Swales (1990, 2004), The other presented a practicl GA analysis example, which ilustrated the processe of identifying GAs' moves and stes and judgin heir corresponding ERAs take-home messages. During the week, any questions or concerns about the meeting were highly welcomed and individually adresed to ensure allthe informants fully undersood the procedure. dditionally each informant was asked to review the 2-5 GAs and thecorresponding ERAs they had chosen, until they comprehensively knew the materials content and organizational structures.

The meeting began with each informant introducing their selected 2-5 ERAs, outlining the background knowledge and summa rizing the main content. This was followed by a one-on-one discussion between the first author and each informant, where the latter played a primary role in identifying the ERAs' take-home messages and analyzing the corresponding GAs' moves and steps.It is noteworthy that when one informant engaged i this discussion, the other two had the opportunity to support or challenge his/her judgement, ask questions, and share their own perspectives.

# 2.2.1. Identification of ERAs' take-home messages

The process f identifying ERAs take-home messages started with informants meticulously examining each ERA for a comprehensive understanding of it content and context. Focus was then given to the Title, Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion sections leading to the inductie coding of the ERA's take-home mesage (Fig. 1, ISPRS1 (GS) in Appendix D as an example). fter consulting 33 specialist informants acros 11 disciplines, the first and second authors cllaboratively rviewed the corpus of 110 ERAs and their associated video-recorded analyses. This review process was iterated to systematicll categorize the ERAs' take-home messages.

The resulting categories were further triangulated by a corpus-assisted approach. Specifically, $1 0 \%$ of ERAs from each category were randomly chosen, and for each selected ERA, the 10 most frequent leical words and associated concordance lines were compiled and careully examined toance the reliability of our qualitative cassfications and interretations of ERAs take-home messages. As seen in Table 1, the 10 most frequent lexical words in Ss1 (GS), along with their selected concordance lie, all ointed to the name, functions, or nnovative aspects of the ERA's newly proposed methodology-a full automatic approach to extract surface changes overlapping spatially and temporally from 3D time series data.

# 2.2.2. Identification of GAs' moves and steps

GAs moves were coded using the IMRD framework (Florek & Hendges, 2023), with the informants defining and elucidating their communicative functions to the first author. Next, given the lack of an established GA step structure, an inductive approach was adopted to identify the specific steps that realize the GAs' moves. For example, ERA asociated with Fig. 2 (ISPRs1 (GS) in Appendix D) developed a fully automatic methodology to extract natural surface changes. The left side of Fig. 2 used a combination of a heading, a diagram, and accompanying explanatory texts to illstrate this new methodology's innovation in detecting and delineating natural surface changes even with spatial and/or temporal overlaps, which was identified by the informants as Presenting innovative aspects of ERA new/advanced methodologies' within the Methods move. The right side used a heading, data maps, and graphs to report the assesment results on how this new methodology detected and extracted temporary accumulation and erosion forms i a Dutch sandy beach, which was labeled by the informants as Reporting efectivenes asessment results of ERA new/advanced methodologies by case studies within the Results move In line with Paltridge (1994), the identification of GAs' moves and steps was primarily based on the content, supplemented by linguistic and visual metadiscourse when relevant $\mathbf { D } ^ { \star }$ Angelo, 2018; Sancho-Guinda, 2017, 2021). The metadiscourse items included but were not limited to headings, font styles, frames (.g., frame lines, color contrast, spacing), layout strategies (such as placing given information on the left and new information on the right), connective elements (e.g., vectors, shape repetition, alignment), functional use of color and size, and graphic elements (e.g., diagrams, photographs, cartoons, charts, tables, geographical maps, data maps, graphs).

Fig. 2. Original (above) and move-step coded (below) ISPRs1 (GS) GA

The identification of GAs' moves and steps presented several challenges due to the genre's static and multimodal nature. Unlike verbal or video abstracts that fllow a temporal, linear logic to present information, GAs organize content based on a spatial, non-linear logic. As the transitions between moves and stes in GAs were not always marked by vectors or frames but by subtle visual cues such as spatially contiguouscollocation, informants needed to exert high cognitive fforts and apply specialied expertise to correctly identify the rhetorical shift. This task was further complicated by the integration of verbal and visual modes in GAs, as each mode could either independently or collaboratively repreent a move or step, depending on the relationships of extension or elaboration between modes (Van Leeuwen, 2005). Moreover, the lack of a predefined move-step structure for GAs led specialist informants to adopt an inductive coding approach, which, while flexible, also introduced a certain level of subjectivity into their analysis of the moves and steps communicative functions. To mitigate these challenges, when encountering discrepancies in identifying the boundaries and communicative functions of GAs moves and steps, 3 specialis informants from the same discipline were asked to engage in iterative rounds of discussions until the consensus was achieved.

After consulting 33 specialist informants from 11 disciplines, the first and second authors jointly reviewed the 110 GAs along with their video-recorded coding processes. This review was iterated to group the moves and steps based on similar communicative functions, thereby delineating GAs' rhetorical structures. The first author also corroborated the resulting structures with several specialist informants for further validation.

# 2.3. Criteria for evaluating centrality of moves and steps

Occurrence frequencies of moves and steps across 110 GAs were recorded to evaluate their centrlit. In line with the statistical approach typicall used in ERA genre studies (e.g., Kanoksilapatham, 2005; Nwogu, 1997; Tessuto, 2015), each move or step was counted only once despite its multipl occurrences in one GA. Following Gao and Pramoolsook's (2021) criteria, a move or step was classified as "obligatory," "conventional," or "optional' if it appeared in $8 0 { - } 1 0 0 \%$ $5 0 \mathrm { - } 7 9 \%$ , and in less than $5 0 \%$ of the GAs, respectively (p. 728). The reason for adopting the modest cutoff frequency of $8 0 \%$ and $5 0 \%$ was due to the relatively limited number of GAs corresponding to each ERA take-home message category and the significant rhetorica variations currently observed in GAs (Sancho-Guinda, 2015, 2022).

# 2.4. Intra- and inter-coder reliability

To evaluate the coding consistency of ERAs take-home messages and GAs' moves and steps, both intra- and inter-coder reliability were examined. To assess the intra-coder reliability, $1 0 \%$ of the GA corpus (1 GA from each of the 11 disciplines) were randomly selected fllowing Hyland's (2004) critrion. Eleven out of the 33 specialist informants who had originall selected and analyzed these 11 GAs were re-invited six months later to code the corresponding ERAs' take-home messages and the GAs' moves and steps. Intra-coder reliability measured by Cohen's Kappa yielded scores of 1.00 for ERAs' take-home mesages, 0.905 for GAs' moves, and 0.821 for GAs' steps. To further assess the inter-coder reliability, 1 new specialist was recruited from each of the 11 disciplines (Appendix C), who underwent a $3 0 { \cdot } \mathrm { { m i n } }$ training in the classification of ERAs' take-home messages and GAs' move-step frameworks, and independently coded the 1 randomly selected GA and corresponding ERA in his/her own discipline. Their coding results were compared with those from the 33 specialis informants in the GA analysis procedure, yielding inter-coder rliability scores of 1.000for ERAs' take-home messages, 0.753 for GAs' moves, and 0.728 for GAs' steps. Both intra- and inter-coder rlability surpassed 0.60, with some exceeding 0.75, indicating a good to excellent level of coding consistency (Fleiss, 1981 cited in Orwin, 1994).

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Move structures of GAs

Table 2 shows that the Results move is obligatory in GAs $( 9 0 \% )$ , while a complete IMRD move sequence is relatively rare.

GAs' move structures vary significantly even within a single discipline, which stems from their corresponding ERAs' different tak home messages. As shown in Table 3, these messages are categorized into three types: (1) exploration of new phenomena and/s mechanisms, (2) introduction of new methodologies, and (3) development of new products.

As shown in Table 3, fifty-nine ERAs' take-home message lies in either exploring new phenomena or elucidating existing phe nomena mechanisms (with several ERAs integrating both aspects). These ERAs san acrossall11 disciplines except Materials cience, and are predominantl found in biology-related fields, including Clinical Medicine (10 ERAs out of 10), Biology & Biochemistry, Plant & Animal Science, Agricultural Sciences (9 ERAs out of 10 each), and Environment/Ecology (6 ERAs out of 10). In the 59 GAs see Table 4), the Results move $( 9 1 . 5 3 \% )$ is obligatory to present the ERAs newly observed phenomena and/or their underlying systems of causally interacting parts and processes. Title, Introduction, Methods, and Discussion moves are lessused and optional.

Nineteen ERAs' take-home message (Table 3) lies in methodological development or advancement. These ERAs are primarily found in Geosciences (7 ERAs out of 10) that emphasizes the enhancement of remote sensing imagery accuracy and topographical map precision through methodological innovation, and in Computer Science (5 ERAs out of 10) that focuses on developing new/advanced algorithm-based techniques for efficient data management and analysis. In the 19 GAs (Table 4), the Methods move $( 9 4 . 7 4 \% )$ is obligatory to introduce the design or flowchart of new/advanced methodologies, and the Results move $( 6 8 . 4 2 \% )$ is conventional to report on the sssment results of these methodologies effetiveness. Abstract, Inoduction, and Discussion moves are les used and optional.

Thirty-two ERAs' take-home message (Table 3) lies in product development or advancement. These ERAs are predominantly sourced from Materials Science (9 ERAs out of 10), Engineering, Physics (7 ERAs out of 10 each), and Chemistry (6 ERAs out of 10) which focus on designing products with specialized properties, superior performance, and practical applications. In the 32 GAs (Table 4), the Results move $( 1 0 0 \% )$ is obligatory, indicating its importance in presenting the new/advanced products' superior characteristics. Introduction, Methods, and Discussion moves are less used and optional.

To summarize, GAs' move structures are significantly influenced by ERAs' take-home mesages, which is evident in the varying frequencies and communicative functions of specific GA moves. This enables the ERAs main findings and contributions to be \*taken in at a single glance' (Hendges & Florek, 2019, p. 66).

# 3.2. Step structures of GAs

# 3.2.1. Step structures of phenomenon and/or mechanism-exploration GA.

Tables 5 and 6 show that phenomenon and/or mechanism-exploration GAs in basic medicine (a sub-discipline of CM) and other STEM fields typicall feature  rhtoricl incomplete, take-home-message-fouse ste structure, and those in clinical trils (another sub-discipline of CM) are characterized by a more complete step pattern.

As shown in Table 5, phenomenon and/or mechanism-exploration GAs in basic medicine and other STEM fields conventionally use (R) Step 2 Displaying key new phenomena observed in ERA' $( 7 5 \% )$ to emphasize the most critical observations or data for addressing ERAs' research questions or purposes. (R) Step 3 Describing underlying mechanisms of ERA key new phenomena' serves to elucidate the interconnected system of parts and processes that generate these key new phenomena. Its relatively les frequent use in GAs $( 3 6 . 5 4 \% )$ may stem from the complex nature of mechanisms and the challenges they pose for comprehension. Fig. 3 presents a GA example (Cell4(BB) in Appendix D) to illustrate the use of (R) Step 2 and (R) Step 3.

In Fig. 3, its ERA explores whether SARs-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies that protect against cCOvID-19 can mediate disease enhancement. It shows that RBD or NTD antibodies exhibit infection enhancement in vitro but not in vivo, which is the ERA's key new phenomenon [(R) Step 2 in Table 5]. The mechanisms underlying the in vitro infection enhancement [(R) Step 3 in Table 5] are schematiclly depicted within a stylized lens icon, a typical visual metadiscours item to llustrate microscopic proceses invisible to naked eyes (Sancho-Guinda, 2021). Both (R) Step 2 and (R) Step 3 are highlighted with a gray background in Fig.3 contrasting with the (M) Step 1 that depicts the ERA's subjects and (R) Step 1 that shows the study's preliminary findings on phenotypes and binding modes of infection-enhancing or non-infection-enhancing RBD or NTD antibodies.

As shown in Table 6, clinical trial GAs tend to follow a complete IMRD move sequence. The Introduction move is conventionaly included, primarily focusing on (I) Step 2 Stating research purposes or questions of ERA. The Methods move describes the trials design and core procedures, which is obligatory and often presents the types of clinical trial design [(M) Step 1], participants selection and eligibilit critria [(M) Step 2], interventions [(M) Step 4], and primary outcomes (i.e, the most important critriafor acessing the effects of interventions) (M) Step 5]. The obligatory Results move typically gives visual display and numeric data of the primary outcomes [(R) Step 2]. The Discussion move is conventional and often realized by (D) Step 1 to provide a brief summary of the trials. Fig. 4 presents a GA example (JAMA2(CM) in Appendix D) to illustrate the seven frequently used steps.

In Fig. 4, its ERA examines the effect of continuous hypertonic saline on 6-month neurological outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury. The research question [)Step 2 in Table6] and main conclusion [D) Step 1 in Table 6] are strategically positioned atthe top against a white background, offring readers an immediate understanding of the ERA's take-home message. The Methods and Results moves are presented below with a yellow background, providing an overview of the trial's important detail including population and eligibility criteria, locations, intervention, primary outcome, and visual display and numeric data of the outcome (M) Step 2-5 and (R) Step 2 in Table 6].

# 3.2.2. Step structure of methodology-introduction GAs

Table 7 shows that (M) Step 1 $( 8 9 . 4 7 \% )$ is obligatory for methodology-introduction GAs, either comprehensively detailing the workflows of new/advanced methodologies or exclusively highlighting their inovative features. Meanwhile, (R) Step 1 $( 6 3 . 1 6 \% )$ is conventionally used to report the effectiveness asessment resuls of the new/advanced methodologies in addressing real-world problems, typicall through case studies. Fig. 5 (RM&MS1 (GS) GA in Appendix D) and Fig.2 (ISPRs1 (GS) in Appendix D) present two GA examples to illustrate the application of (M) Step 1 and (R) Step 1.

In Fig.5 it ERA proposes an image-based methodology to automatically segment rock fractures and quantify fracture traces. The GA's left side provides a detailed overview of the methodology's workflow [(M) Step 1 (workflows) in Table 7], which comprises five components (i.e., RTF database, FraSegNet model, fracture skeleton extraction, chain code-based polyline approximation, and comprehensive evaluation), each elucidated with accompanying descriptive image(s). The GA's right side reports the assessment results on how this new methodology extracts and evaluates fracture trace maps in Mengzi-Pingbian Highway Project Yunnan, China [(R) Step 1 in Table 7]. Unlike Fig. 5, the left side of Fig. 2 focuses exclusively on the new full automated methodology's innovative aspect, which ie in its abilit to detect and delineate natural surface changes even with spatial and/or temporal overlaps (M) Step 1 (innovative aspects) in Table 7].

# 3.2.3. Step structure of product-development GAs

As shown in Table 8, product-development GAs conventionally use (R) Step 3 $( 6 2 . 5 0 \% )$ , (R) Step 5 $( 5 0 \% )$ and (R) Step 6 $( 6 2 . 5 0 \% )$ to demonstrate the structures, performance, and operational mechanisms of new/advanced products, respectively. Fig.6 (InfoMat2 (MS) GA in Appendix D) illustrates the use of these steps through a GA example.

In Fig. 6, its ERA develops a self-powered, filter-free near-infrared narrowband detector characterized by an $\mathrm { n { \cdot } C d S e / p { \cdot } S b _ { 2 } ( S _ { 1 - X } , }$ $S e _ { \mathrm { x } } ) _ { 3 }$ heterojunction structure (schematic ilustration in GA's lower lft corner) (R) Step 3 in Table 8]. The detector operates within the $6 5 0 { - } 9 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ optimal optical window previously established as the range minimizing biological tissues' light absorption (graph in GA's upper half) [(1) Step 1 in Table 8]. It reaches its peak performance at $7 3 5 \mathrm { n m }$ with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of $3 2 . 2 \%$ and a photoresponsivity of $0 . 1 9 \mathrm { A } \mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }$ (graph in GA's lower right corner) [(R) Step 5 in Table 8]. The detector's working mechanism [(R) Step 6 in Table 8] schematically represented on its structure shows that the n-CdSe layer can absorb light below $7 1 8 \mathrm { n m }$ (blue and green lines) and the $\mathrm { p } { \cdot } S \mathrm { b } _ { 2 } ( \mathrm { S } _ { \mathrm { 1 - x } } , S \mathrm { e } _ { \mathrm { x } } ) _ { 3 }$ layer can respond to light between 718 and $8 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ (red line), enabling the detector to deliver its outstanding performance within the optimum optical window.

# 4. Discussion

Using Swales' (1990, 2004) framework, our study analyzed GAs move and step structures and found that they were significantly influenced by ERAs' take-home messages. In this section, we summarize our major findings and discuss them in relation to previous studies of ERA add-on genres.

Fig. 6. Original (above) and move-step coded (below) InfoMat2 (MS) GA.

First, he overarching analysis of 110 sTeM GAs revealed that the Results move was obligatory, while other moves including Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, and Discussion were optional. This aligns with the findings of Yoon and Chung (2017) and Florek and Hendges (2023), who identified the Results as the most frequently used move in social science GAs and the only obligatory move in chemistry GAs. Such a rhetorical focus on the Results indicates a significant shift from traditional verbal abstracts (Bhatia, 1993, Brenton, 196; Swales, 1990, 2004) and video abstracts (Plastina, 2017)both of which fulill asummarize-to-atract purpose by reproducing ERAs full IMRD structure -and from audioslides (Yang, 2017) which emphasize the Inroduction and Methods to outline the research motivation and design. In contrast, GAs fulfilla highlight-to-atract purpose, focusing mainly on ERAs' key findings and innovations to give readers an immediate understanding of the take-home messages. Thus, GAs represent a more time-fficient and effective ERA promotional genre within the rapidly advancing and information-saturated scientific landscape (Hendges & Florek, 2019), as compared to their verbal and audiovisual counterparts.

Second, GAs' move structures were significantly influenced by ERAs' thre different types of take-home messages: (1) exploration of new phenomena and/or mechanisms, (2) inroduction of new methodologies, and (3) development of new products, as reflected in the varying functions and frequencies of specific GA moves. Unlike Yoon and Chung (2017) and Florek and Hendges (2023) focusing on the disciplinary impacts (i.., social sciences, and chemistry and medicine, respectively), our study is the first to systematically categorize ERAs' take-home messages across 11 sTEM disciplines and relate them to GAs' move structures, recognizing that ERAs could convey a variety of take-home messages even within a single discipline. Our findings showed that for phenomenon and/or mechanism-exploration GAs and product-development GAs, the Results was the only obligatory move, serving either to highlight the newly observed phenomena and/or mechanisms or to showcase the superior characteristics of the new/advanced products. Conversely, for methodology-introduction GAs, the Methods move was obligatory and the Results move was conventional, frequently working together to present the design and effctivenessasessment result of the new/advanced methodologie. ur findins to some extent align with those of Yang (2016) who examined the move structure of research highlights in hard sciences and discovered that as a form of new knowledge creation and innovation, the introduction of new methods prompted authors to highlight both the Methods and Results moves. These indings collctively suggest that academic promotional genres tend to emphasize more than just the \*main' or \*new findings reported in ERAs Resuls ection (Cell Pres, 2018; lsevier, 2022). Instead, they can encapsulat wider spectrum of "scientific contributions" (Hullman & Bach, 2018, p. 183) or "new knowledge (Yang, 2016, p. 94), including aspects such as methodological innovations typically discussed in ERAs' Methods section.

Third, while most GAs exhibited a rhetorically incomplete move structure, those in clinical trials stood out by their frequent adherence to a complete IMRD move pattern. This i largely consistent with Florek and Hendges (2023) findings that the Itroduction, Methods, Results, and Conclusion moves were all present in over $5 0 \%$ of clinical trial GAs. This complete rhetorical tendency is likely influenced by standardizd ERA reporting guidelines in clincal trials (., CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA, TREND, STARD), which, by requring minimum sets of obligatory items in each IMRD section, ensure the design, analysis, and interpretation of trials to be comprehensive, transparent, and repeatable. Clinical ril jounals may continue to prioritize such rhetorical completenes in their GA design and provide readers with a concise yet informative article snapshot. Furthermore, this tendency may also be interpreted by the concept of visual abstracts commonly used in clinical trials (e.g., JAMA, 2024; NEJM, 2024). Although sometimes used inter. changeably with the tem of graphical abstracts, visual astracts literall refer to  visual summary of the information contained in the abstract" (brahim, 2018, p. 8). Theefore, like their traditional verbal counterparts, they may fullla summarize-to-atract purpose, allowing readers to quickly preview the clinical rils key questions, methodologies, primary findings, and conclusions and to decide whether to proced in reading thentire articles. It is worth noting that as they do not contain all the research details (Ibrahim et al., 2017), they cannot be a substitute for reading the whole ERAs and only function as a\*movie trailer to them (Wray & Arora, 2017, p. e49).

Fourth, our study delineated GA ste structures for the three types of ERA take-home mesages. Phenomenon and/or mechanism exploration GAs conventionall included (R) Step 2 to highlight the observations or data crucial for addressing ERAs' research questions. In methodology-introduction GAs, (M) Step 1 was obligatory, focusing on presenting the workflows or inovative aspects of new/advanced methodologie, with (R) Ste 1 being conventional to report the effctivenessassessment results of the methodologies by case studies. Product-development GAs conventionally use (R) Step 3, (R) Step 5, and (R) Step 6 to display the structures, performance, and operational mechanisms of new/advanced products, respectively. Compared with previous studies that established step structures for linearly organized ERA promotional genres like Bigger Picture (Katsampoxaki-Hodgetts, 2022), research highlights (Akbas & Farnia, 2021), and video abstracts (Plastina, 2017), our study innovates by using Swales' (1990, 2004) genre analysis framework to delineate the step structures for GAs, thereby extending its application to a static visual genre characterized by non-linear and spatial-based narrative logic. Moreover, by refining GAs' move structures proposed by prior research (Florek & Hendges, 2023; Sancho-Guinda, 2015; Yoon & Chung, 2017), our study presents a framework comprising both level of move and step, which is more efective for GA description and pedagogy (Yang & Allison, 2003) and may provide practical guidance for scientific authors who may lack formal training in visual communication but nowadays are increasingly responsible for creating GA.

Our study challenges Sancho-Guinda's (2015) views of GAs as having blurred move boundaries and being overly "fluid and insecure" (Kres, 2010, p. 130) for a canonical rhetorical structure. With the dominant role played by specialist informants in the process, we identified obligatory/conventional move(s) and ste(s) for GAs corresponding to each type of ERA take-home message, thereby revealing a certain level of rhetorical stability. This is crucial for the recognition and reproduction of GAs, which are typically considered as a "new hybrid partly promotional genre" (Fairclough, 1995, p. 139) characterized by the "dynamic and versatile' (Bhatia, 2005, p. 214) features of advertisements.

Our findings contribute to future studies of ERA add-on genres in the following aspects. First our study used Swales (1990, 2004) genre analysis framework to investigate GAs' move and step structures, extending its aplicatin from linear, primarily verbal (written or spoken) promotional genres to the staticvisuals characterized by non-linear and spatial narrative logic. This indicates that genre theory may continue to be a \*powerful analytical too (Luzon & Perez-Llantada, 2019, p. 2) even when dynamism and multimodality become significant features of ERA add-on genres. Second, the GA move-step structures established by our study, varying according to ERAs' diferent types of take-home messages, diverged from those reported by existing GA analyses that focused on disciplinary impacts. This suggests that it is important to consider ERAs various types of scientific contributions when analyzing their add-on genres' rhetorical structures. Third, our study sets a new precedent in GA analysis by giving specialist informants the dominant role in GA selection and rhetorical analysis. These specialists helped to more precisely identify ERAs take-home messages and delimit GAs' moves and steps, highlighting the need to involve informants with specialized technical expertise in the rhetorical analyses of ERA add-on genres.

# 5. Conclusion

Using Swales' (1990, 2004) framework, this study examined the move and step structures of 110 sTEM GAs. Our analysis revealed that GAs' move and step structures, along with their frequently used moves and steps, were significantly influenced by ERAs three different tyes of take-home messages: (1) exploration of new phenomena and/or mechanisms, (2) introduction of new methodologies, and (3) development of new products. Our findings enrich the current understanding of GAs rhetorical structures and have practical insights for genre-based GA pedagogy.

Several limitations and opportunities for future research exist. First, in this study, we treated GAs as a stand-alone construct characterized by its own generic integrit, exploring is communicative purposes and rhetorical structres. However, i i important to realize that genres are actuall interrelated in the digital environment, closely linking with each other at the semantic, syntactic, rhetorical, and/or semiotic levels. Future studies could delve deer into this "genre network" (Perez-Llantada & Luzon, 2023, p.13) among ERA add-on genres and examine how they work together to realize the ERA promotional purpose. Second, this study investigated GAs move and step structures solely from the authorial production perspective. Future research can further evaluate GA design from the reader perception perspective, investigating to what extent can GAs address the needs of experts-in-the-field, novice researchers, and general public. Third, the specialist informants involved in this study, being master's and PhD students in the STEM fields, might posess relatively limited disciplinary knowledge and expertise. Future research could incorporate more experienced specialists, such as STEM teachers and professors, to validate or complement our findings and offer more comprehensive insights into GA rhetorical structures.

The GA move and step structures outlined in our study have practical implications for genre-based GA design and pedagogy. To begin with, they offr a safe starting point for scientific authors, who often receive limited visual communication training yet are increasingly tasked with creating GAs to promote their scientific contributions. As these authors become more skilled in using GAs, they can creatively adapt these structures and align them more closely with their ERAs take-home messages. In addition, academic publishers may also draw upon our findings to provide more specific GA design guideline for their authors, as opposed to the current vague requirements like presenting the main findings of the article" (Elsevier, 2022). GAs' move and step structures can also be integrated into academic writing courses to raise students awareness f the rhetorical similarities and differences between GAs and other ERA add-on genres. As artfical inelligence (Al technology advances, our findings could also contribute to the development of AI models capable of automatically generating GAs based on ERAs' key content.
