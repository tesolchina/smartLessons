Abstract   
Syntactic complexity

Plain Language Summary (PLS) has been increasingly required for manuscript submission by leading academic journals across various disciplines. While Abstract is an important academic genre for communication with fellow researchers, PLS targets the general public with limited disciplinary knowledge. Few studies to date have explored the linguistic differences between PLSs and Abstracts. Addressing this issue, however, is important for understanding how scholars adapt their language choices for different audiences and for providing guidance and affordance for the PLS writing practice. Drawing on a parallel corpus of Abstracts and PLSs of Marine Science research articles, this study investigates the variations in syntactic complexity between PLSs and Abstracts. Our results demonstrate that Abstracts utilize longer production units and more complex nominals than PLSs, while PLSs employ more subordinate clauses and nominal subjects per clause than Abstracts. Implications for PLS writing practice and pedagogy are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

A Plain Language Summary (PLS) i a research summary written in a manner devoid of technical terms, rendering it accessible and comprehensible to non-expert or lay audiences. A variety of terms have been used to denote such summaries, including accessible summarie (e.g, Marsden et al., 2019), lay summarie (e.g, Kuehne & Olden, 2015), lay astracts (e.g., Dube & Lapane, 2014), and so on. The advent of PS stems from a broad range f rationales, including theepistemic responsibilit of researchers t disseminatheir insights (Chubb & Reed, 2018), the otential to empower the general public in making informed choices (Penlington et l., 2022), and personal incentives such as enhanced visibility and impact for researchers (Kuehne & Olden, 2015), to name a few.

In recognition of the significance of this emergent genre, an increasing number of academic jounals across various disciplines (i. Marine Science, Applied Linguistics Psychology, and Medicine) have instituted a requisite for PLSs to be presented in conjunction with research article abstracts. In Applied Linguisics, for instance journals such as The Moden Language Journl, Language Learning, Studies in Second Language Acqusition and TEsoL Quarterl have required authors of ccepted articles to upload accessible summaries to the Open Accessble Summaries In Language Studies (OAsis) database. In the field of Geophysics, encompassing Marine Science, ll 23 peer-reviewed journals under the American Geophysical Union (AGU) have included PLS as a mandatory document to be submitted with the research manuscript since January 2018.

Despite the growing popularity of PLSs in a range of academic disciplines, t remains largely unknown whether and in what ways

PLSs differ from Abstract in terms of linguistic features. The few studies on PLSs to date have focused on the asessment of thir effectivenes and redabilit (., Banic et al., 2022; Kadic et al., 2016). Linguistic features of PLSs, however, have reeived lttle attention, thus hindering the provision of effective guidance and affordance for the PLS writing practce Thistudy compares PLSs and their corresponding Abstracts i syntactic complexity, a multidimensional construct measured by indices at varying levels of granularity (Lu, 2010; Norrs & Ortega, 2009). Such a comparative analysis can help reveal the syntactic complexity differences between the two genres and therefore advance our understanding of the understudied genre of PLS with reference to Abstract, a genre more conventionally known to academic writers.

Marine Sciece was chosen as the focus icipline in this study for several reasons: Firs, the inclusiveness and accessibility of ocean science literacy are crucial for promoting global and public engagement in sustainable development. Second, as previously noted, the importance of PLSs has been widely recognized in the discipline of Marine Science. Third, unlike the OAsIS summaries in Applied Linguistic that employ question-like subheadings and bullet lis, the PS in numerous Marine Science academic journals is presented as a continuous block of text with complete sentences. This structure aligns closely with the presentation of an Abstract.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Research on PLS

As the importance of providing public accessto scientificresearch gains recognition, PLSs become increasingly popular in various disciplines, incuding Geophysics (eg., Hauck, 2019), Alied Linguistics (e.g., Marsden et al., 2019), Medicine (e.g., Pushparajah et al., 018), and Psychology (. Stricker et al., 2020). rent omprehensive literre reviw of PL rearch by Stl et l. (2022) reveals three primary rearch venues: theoretical studie (e, rviews, opinion pes, editrials), guidance-related studie (related to guidelines or the development of guidelines), and empirical studies, accounting for $4 0 \%$ $2 3 \%$ and $3 7 \%$ of the 90 studies under review, respectively. This distribution underscores the diverse approaches taken by researchers to investigate the gere of PLS, with a notable emphasis on non-empirical investigations (including the first two categories which constitute $6 3 \%$ in total) but a relatively lower number $( 3 7 \% )$ of empirical studies. Furthermore, existing empirical studies have predominantly explored the efficacy of PLS, highlighting the important role of PLS in streamlining the communication between authors and lay reader (Pushparajah et al., 2018), enhancing reader confidence in making research-informed decisions (Kerwer et al., 2021), and extending the reach of scientific research (Dormer & Walker, 2020). However, there is a conspicuous dearth of research analyzing the linguistic characteristics of PLS. Such an analysis is valuable for enhancing our understanding of the linguistic features of PLSs and can asst in addressing the challenges faced by PLS writers, who are often deeply rooted in their felds, lack training in crafting content for non-specialis au. diences, and consequently, struggle to distinguish between technical and layman's language.

# 2.2. Research on syntactic complexity and readability of academic genres

Syntactic complexity refers to the degre of sophistication, variation and elaboration of grammatical structures in language production (Lu et al., 2020; Ortega, 2003). Syntactic complexity can be measured by indices in different dimensions, including global indices (e.g., mean length of sentence), clausal indices e.g., number of dependent clauses per T-unit) and sub-clausal indices (e.g, number of adjectival modifiers per nominal).

In the field of English academic writing, syntactic complexity has been extensively examined in relation to genres (e.g., Brs & Nagy, 2011), comuncative puroses (e.g., L e al., 2021), discilines (e.g., Casal et al., 2021; Dong e al., 2023), writig proficiency (e.g., Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014), and writing quality (e.g,Li & Yang, 2023), individually or in combination. These investigations have demonstrated a noteworthy interplay between various text-intrinsic and tex-extrinsic factors and syntactic complexity features, as wellas revealing a set of syntactic complexity measures that ca efecively differentiate genres, rhetorical maneuvers, discilines, varying levels of writing proficiency and qualit. Recently, a burgeoning scholarship has begun to delve into the variations in syntactic complexity across reearch articl (RA) part-genres (Casl e l., 2021; Nassri, 2021; i t al., 2021). his burgeoning scholarshi not only enhances our understandings of the intricate relationship between syntactic complexity and divers communicative aims of RA part-genres, but has profound implications for the evaluation and teaching of academic writing. Focusing on RA Abstracts in the field of Applied Linguists, Yin et al. (2021) observed that both emerging and expert intenational publication writers used sigificantly more complex noun phrases and fewer subordinate clauses in their Abstracts than all other RA sections, with the exception of the Results section. In line with Yin et al. (2021), Nasseri's (2021) investigation of master's disertations showed distinctive syntactic features in the Abstract section, particularl a significantly higher frequency of complex nominals. These findings contribute to rasing awareness among academic writers about the interconnections and distinctions among various RA part-genres. Importantly, they challenge the prevailing assumption of the universal complexity of academic writing (Casal et al., 2021) and orient learners to the functional motivations behind the choice of syntactic structures. As argued by Lu et al. (2020: 2), "quality writing is characterized by genre-appropriate and functionall effective usage of complex syntactic structures, rather than the frequency of complex syntactic structures alone'. The orientation to substantial variation in syntactic complexity across RA part-genres helps foster a nuanced understanding and more strategic usage of syntactic features in diffrent RA sections among learners of academic writing.

Previous research has shown that syntactic complexity can influence text readability, which can be defined as the comprehensibility or ease with which readers can read and understand. Various syntactic complexity measures have been used as readability indices, intilly including measures such as the average sentence length (Coleman & Liau, 1975; Kincaid et al., 1975). More recently, features related to syntacticall parsed tree (Schwarm & Ostendorf, 2005), average lengths of noun, verb and prepositional phrases (Feng, 2010), syntactic complexity measures from second language acquisition (SLA) literature (Vajjala & Meurers, 2012), and complexity measures at the phrasal level (rossley et al., 2019, 2023) have een employed. Empirical investgations in this line have identified a range of syntactic complexity features as effctive indicators of text readability. Vajjala and Meurers (2012) integrated 25 syntactic features into their radability classfication models and demonstrated that the 14 sLA-based syntactic complexity measures, summarized i Lu (2010), are useful indicators for readabilit classfication. The model incorporating these 14 measures achieved a $7 1 . 2 \%$ accuracy in readability classfication, with mean length of sentence (MLS), dependent clauses per clause (DC/C) and complex nominals per T-unit (CN/C) ranking among the top 10 most predictive features, alongside other lexical features. Examining specific measures, Eslami (2014) found the use f shorter sentences improved text readability and promoted reader comprehension. Pitler and Nenkova (2008) reported a positive correlation betwen the use of subordinate structures with text readability. Crossley et al. (2023) further revealed that the complex syntactic structures at the phraal level (e.g., the number of noun phrase dependents) resulted in lower readabilit. Since PS, by definition, is expected to exhibit higher readability than Abstract, i is probable that PLs difer from Abstracts in these readability-related complexity features.

The syntactic complexity of Abstracts and PLSs may also inluence the social and scientific impact of the RA (Jin et al., 2021; Lu et a. 2019). Lu et al. (2019), fr instance, showed that RAs with higher scientific mpact typically feature onger sentences than those with lower impact. In terms of the social impact of RAs, Jin et al. (2021) found a positive corrlation with the density of complex nominals in RA Abstracts, while observing a negative relationship with the density of verb phrases in RA Abstracts. The significant role of the Abstract in the social and scientific impact of an RA can be atributed to its nature as a widely available summary that may influence readers' decision to retrieve and read the entire article (Swales & Feak, 2009). Similarly, PLS is a widely distributed and intellectually accessible research summary designed to enhance the social impact of scholarly work. Examination of the syntactic complexity features of PLs and Abstracts s therefore critical for understanding and advancing efective communication of research ideas and findings.

# 3. Method

In order to deepen our understanding of the linguistic differences between PLSs and Abstracts, the present study compares the two genres (or RA part-genres) in a range of syntactic complexity measures. The research question of this study is as follows: Are there significant differences in syntactic complexity between Abstracts and PLss? If so, what are these differences?

# 3.1. Corpus

The data comprised 200PLSs and 200 Abstracts of the same set of published research article, randomly selected from the Jounal of Geophysical Research: Oceans (henceforth JGR0) between 2020 and 2023 (inclusive). JGRO publishes oceanography research across various strands, including physical and chemical oceanography, marine biology, marine geology, and related areas. Each research article contains aPLS and an Astract written by the same author() of the research article. Table 1 preents the descriptie statistic of the corpus. As can be seen, the average length of the Abstract is 244 words, while the mean length of the PLS is 178 words. This difference in length may e partially ttributed to the jounal's word limit, which requires the Abstract to remain under 250 words and the PLS to be no longer than 200 words.

The selection of JGRO was based on two criteria. First, JGRO is a peer-reviewed journal indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) database of the Web of Science. According to the Journal Citation Reports for 2022, this journal holds a high five-year impact factor of 4.1, ranking the 9th among the 63 scIE-indexed journals in the field of Oceanography. Second, we contacted seven professor in Marine Science from a leading ocean universty in China and asked them to name the top ten academic journals in their research fields. Five of the seven expert informants named JGRO as a top journal in Marine Science. Given the rigorous editorial and peer review processes, we regard the articles published in this journal as high-quality works.

# 3.2. Syntactic complexity analysis

The L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA; Lu, 2010) and the Tol for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity (TAAssc 1.3.8; Kyle 2016) were used for the current analysis L2SCA i a widely used syntactic complexity analyzer with high accuracy (i., from 0.834 to 1.00; Lu, 2010, 2011; Lu & Ai, 2015). 25CA includes 14 measures in five categories (Lu, 2010) overall sentence complexity, length of production unit, amount of subordination, amount of coordination, and degree of phrasal complexity.

In addition to the large-grained measures computed by L2sCA, we incorporated a set of fine-grained clausal and phrasal measures from TAAssc. The distinction betwen the two sets of measures ies in that the large-grained measures (e.g., number of dependent clauses per clause) are drawn from the sLA literature and offer a broad perspective of syntactic complexity, while fine-grained measures (g., number of adverbial clauses per clause, number of adjectival modifiers per nominal) are calculated separately for each type of dependent within each clause or phrase type. TAAssC provides 31 fine-grained clausal complexity measures, with 28 representing the number of particular clausal deendent types per clause, and the remaining two being general indices, namely, the average number of dependents per clause and the standard deviation of the number of dependents per clause (a measure of syntactic variation). Our analysis included 30 out of the 31 fine-grained clausal complexity measures, excluding the sole measure of syntactic variation. Regarding phrasa complexity measures, we followed Kyle and Crossey (2018: 8) by excluding pronouns from nominals due to the potential for pronouns as phrases to skew counts of dependents" Different from Kyle and Crossey (2018), but aligned with our choice of indices for clausal complexity measures, we included the 58 phrasal complexity indices from TAAssc, excluding eight indices of phrasal variation. Overall, we investigated a total f 102 measures, as listed in the supplementary data of this artcle also available at https://osf.io/snya3).

# 3.3. Statistical analysis

We used paired samples test to examine if the paired groups (i.e., the PLS and the Abstract of the same research article) were significantly different from each other in terms of each syntactic complexity measure The normal distribution of the residual values of the differences between Abstracts and PLSs was first examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality. Any variables that violated a normal distribution were discarded, and paired samples -tests were conducted only to indices that met the normality precondition. The critical $p$ value was adjusted with the Bonferroni correction, for the purpose of reducing Type I error when multiple pairwise tests are run on a single data set. Specifically, the corrected. $p$ value was .002, that is, 0.05 divided by the number of comparisons being made (24 indices in total). The ggplot2 package in R was used to produce the plots, and SPss 25.0 was used for the statistical analyses in the present study. Cohen's $d$ values were presented and interpreted using the field-specific benchmarks suggested by Plonsky and Oswald (2014): 0.40 (small), 0.70 (medium), and 1.00 (large).

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Overview of measures that reveal a significant between-genre difference

Among the 14 indices of L2scA, five indices met the normality precondition and were taken into further consideration, they were. mean length of T-unit (MLT), mean length of sentence (MLS), dependent clauses per clause (DC/C), verb phrases per T-unit (VP/T), and clauses per sentence (C/s). Four of the five indices, with the exception of verb phrases per T-unit $\left( p = . 0 0 4 \right)$ , showed significant differences between the two genres. $( p < . 0 0 2$ ; see Table 2).

Among the 30 fine-grained clausal indces fromssc, four indices (.., dendets per cause direct objects per clause, nominal subjects per clause, and prepositional modifiers per clause) met the normality precondition of paired samples t-test, but only one measure (i.e., nominal subjects per clause; NS/C) revealed a significant difference between PLSs and Abstracts (see Table 3)

In addition, 15 out of the 58fine-grained phrasal complexity indices from TAAssc met the normality precondition and six of them indicated significant differences between the two genres (see Table 4), namely, dependents per nominal (DP/N), dependents per nominal subject (DP/NS), dependents per prepositional object (DP/PO), adjectival modifiers per nominal (AM/N), nouns as a nominal dependent per nominal (also known as nouns as modifiers per nominal, NM/N), and nouns as a nominal dependent per nominal ubject (also known as nouns as modifiers per nominal subject; NM/NS).

Taken together, significant differences between Abstracts and PLSs were found in11syntactic complexity measures at the clausal level and the phrasal level, as summarized in Table 5. Based on the multidimensional conceptual representation of syntactic complexity in Yang et al. (2015) and the taxonomy of measures outlined in Lu (2010) and Kyle (2016), we categorized the 11 measures into four dimensions. The five clause-level measures essentially cover three dimensions of clausal complexity the length of production unit, the amount of coordination and subordination, and noun phrase elaboration per clause. The six phrase-level measures relate to one dimension: noun phrase complexity. In the fllowing, we willdiscuss the syntactic complexity differences between PLSs and Abstracts at the clausal level and the phrasal level, respectively.

# 4.2. Clausal complexity differences between abstracts and PLSs

In terms of clausal complexity, Abstracts employed significantly longer production units than PLSs. Specifically, Abstracts had significantly longer mean length of T-units $( { \mathrm { m e a n } } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 2 6 . 7 6 1  $ , meanp.s $= 2 4 . 1 4 4$ $t = 6 . 2 9 0$ 3 $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 5 2 9 \AA$ and mean length of sentence than PLSs (meanabstract $= 2 8 . 8 2 2$ , meanpLs $= 2 5 . 7 8 5$ $t = 7 . 6 0 7$ 3 $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 6 2 4 \AA$

Conversely, PLs used significantly more clauses, particularly subordinate clauses, as indicated by a significantly larger number of clauses per sentence $( { \mathrm { m e a n } } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 1 . 5 1 5 $ , meanpLs $= 1 . 6 2 1$ $t = - 3 . 8 4 8$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 1 5$ and dependent clauses per clause $( { \mathrm { m e a n } } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 0 . 2 7 6$ , meanpLs $= 0 . 3 1 3$ $t = - 3 . 2 0 3$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 7 8$ . PLSs also demonstrated a higher number of nominal subjects per clause in comparison to Abstracts $( \mathrm { m e a n } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 0 . 5 2 2$ , meanpLS $= 0 . 5 6 7$ $t = - 3 . 4 0 4$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d =$ 0.312). Fig. 1 gives more details of the descriptive statistics of these clausal complexity features of the two genres. Inthe rest of this section, we will discuss each measure with reference to examples from the corpus.

Examples 1(a) and 1(b) were from the same research article of which the Abstract and the PLS differed notably both in the mean length of sentence and the mean length of T-unit It can be seen that the Abstract includes more detail of the research, such as reporting a more specific time frame (e.g., April 1, 2002 to March 31, 2009) and reporting research findings in more details with numeric value as underlined), whil such information was simplified or omitte from the PLs. The preference for shorter sentences in PLSs, as opposed to Abstracts, may be partly atriuted to the respective word limits st for each genre (i. 200 words for PL vs. 250 words for Abstracts. Another possible reason for the extensive use of shorter sentences in PLSs can be their positive impact onoveral text readability, ashown in Eslami (2014) and Vajjala and Meurers (2012). The extended sentences in Example 1a) not only increase the cognitive load for reading comprehension, but include aditional research details that surpass non-expert readers' prior knowledge. Consequently, writers choose to reduce sentence length and exclude research details in the PLS.

When accounting for both subordination and coordination, PLSs had a significantly higher number of clauses per sentence than Abstracts $( { \mathrm { m e a n } } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 1 . 5 1 5 $ , meanpLs $= 1 . 6 2 1$ $t = - 3 . 8 4 8$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 1 5$ . The measure of dependent clauses per clause (DC/C), which specificall asseses subordination, further confirmed a higher amount f subordination in PLSs than Abstracts. Whether PLSs had a significantly higher amount of coordination than Abstracts remained unknown as the values of the coordination measure violated the normality precondition and were removed from the current analys. We therefore focus our discussion on the use of subordinate clauses in the two genres.

2(a) The latitude of searation of the Brazil Current (LBC) variability is analyzed with a view to unveiling the physical mechanisms. The ENSO-related anomalies travel through the Indonesian Throughflow along the western Australian coast, where Rossby waves are excited. These anomalie propagate to the asten coast f Madgascar and fed into the Aghas urrent, evenuall leking into the Alantic asin. (JGRO_2021_030_Abstract) 2(b) Inthis work we study the low-frequency LSC modulations, which are not yet completely understood. We found that three distinct periodicities characterize the ISBC temporal variability and that they are directly asociated to the interaction of the Brazl Current with incoming ocean waves, known as Rossby waves, that traverse the Atlantic Basin. (JGRO_2021_030_PLS)

The excerpt of Abstract in Example 2(a) includes only one subordinate clause (where Rossby waves are excited). In contrast, the excerpt of PLS in Example 2(b) includes three subordinate clauses (as marked in bold): an attributive clause with a wh-relativizer (which are no et complly undersood), ver-ontrolled thatclause onsisting f two apposite parts ( found hat.. nd hat ..), and an attriutive clause with the relativizer that (that taverse the Atlantic Basin). By means of these subordinate clauses, the PLS provides additional background knowledge (e.g., which re not yet completely undersood, that travers the Alantic Basi) and fronts authors asthe source of reported information (e.g., we found that). This indicates the writer's awareness of different audiences and adaptability in adjusting language. Subordinate clauses, as a type of structural expansion, create les cognitive nd to unpack the information on the part of readers, as the clausal elaboration already specifies the exact meaning relationship for readers (Biber & Gray, 2010). Publ. cation writers extensive use of subordinate clauses in PLSs compared to Abstracts aligns with previous research findings that sub ordinate clauses could increase text readability (Pitler & Nenkova, 2008; Vajjala & Meurers, 2012).

PLSs exhibited a greater number of nominal subjects per clause than Abstracts, which could be due to the more frequent use of active voice in PLSs than Abstracts. Given that passive nominal subjects were counted separately and excluded from the measure of nominal subjects per lause in TAAssc, Abstract writers' preference for passive voice in fact resulted in a lower mean value of this measure. For instance, the Abstract excerpt in Example 3(a) comprises two pasive clauses without nominal subjects. In contrast the paralle sentence in the PLS, as shown in Example 3(b), contains three clauses, two of which are in active voice and have nominal subjects (i.e., We and dust). Similarly, Example 4(a) consists of two clauses in passive voice without any nominal subject, while in Example 4(b), each sentence comprises two clauses and one nominal subject(ie., we in both cases). Consequently, the disparity in nominal subjects per clause seems to be, at least in part, a result of the writer's inclination towards employing active voice to foreground both the authors and the pertinent subject in PLS writing. While disciplinary academic writers frequently employ the passive voice to maintain objectivity and detachment, the use of pasive voice also reduces the clarity and conciseness of writing, which is therefore disfavored in PS writing. Conversely, writers in Pshowed a grater tendency to explicit self-mention, manifesting a more pronounced authorial stance and a higher degree of personal engagement with their audience (Hyland, 2005) within this specific genre.

# 4.3. Phrasal complexity differences between abstracts and PLSs

Overall, Abstracts had higher noun phrase complexity than PLSs, as shown by three general measures for the number of phrasal dependents (i.e., $\mathrm { m e a n } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 1 . 8 8 7$ , meanpLs $= 1 . 7 4 3$ $t = 7 . 2 3 0$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 5 4 8$ for the number of dependents per nominal; meanabstract $= 1 . 6 3 7$ , meanpLs $= 1 . 4 4 1$ $t = 4 . 2 8 8$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 8 0$ for the number of dependents per nominal subject; $\mathrm { m e a n } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 1 . 8 1 6 , \mathrm { m e a n } _ { \mathrm { P L S } } = 1 . 6 8 2 , t = 5 . 3 0 1 , p < . 0 0 2 ,$ Cohen's $d = 0 . 4 5 3$ for the number of dependents per prepositional object) and three pecific measures, two of which are measures for nouns as modifiers and one for adjectival modifiers i., mean. abstrac $\AA _ { : } = 0 . 4 0 7$ $\mathrm { \ m e a n _ { P L S } } = . 3$ 14, $t = 6 . 3 5 9$ $p < . 0 0 2$ Cohen's $d = 0 . 4 4 4$ for nouns as modifiers per nominal; $\mathrm { m e a n } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 0 . 3 4 1$ mea $\mathtt { \Pi } \mathtt { \Pi } _ { \mathtt { P L S } } = . 2 6 9$ $t = 3 . 6 1 9$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 9 0$ for nouns as modifiers per nominal subject; $\mathrm { m e a n } _ { \mathrm { a b s t r a c t } } = 0 . 4 5 2$ meanpLs $=$ .399, $t = 5 . 7 4 0$ $p < . 0 0 2$ , Cohen's $d = 0 . 4 1 7$ for adjectival modifiers per nominal). Fig. 2 visualizes the differences between Abstracts and PLSs in the above-mentioned six phrasal complexity indices, and the diffrences in each dimension will be discussed in the remainder of this section. Examples 5(a) and 5(b) below illstrate the difference between two genres in the number of phrasal dependents per nominal, whereby pronouns were not considered as nominals.

5(a) We examined the distribution of phytoplankton photophysiological properties [across two contrasting regions of the Arctic Ocean with distinctly different levels of nitrogen availabilit in the upper wate colu]. We quantified the xtent of ntrogen stress [using a highly sensitive fluorescence induction and relaxation system to obtain continuous underway measurements and via discrete sample analyses of phytoplankton physiology, as well as nutrient enrichment incubations]. (JGRO_2020_015_Abstract) 5(b) This study investigates, with high spatial resolution the distribution of phytoplankton physiological status and quantifies the effects of nitrogen stress in the western Arctic Ocean. (JGRO_2020_015_PLS)

In TAAssc, dependents encompass a wide range of pre-modifiers post-modifiers and complements to the head noun, including "determiners, adjective modifiers repositional phrases, posessive,verbal modifiers, nouns as modfiers, relative clause modfiers, adverbial modifiers, and conjunctions" (Kyle, 2016, p. 57). While Examples 5(a) and 5(b) similarly present the research purpose and method, the Abstract segment is notably longer than the PLS counterpart. We have underlined the head nouns and marked alldependents within nominals in bold. As we can see, dependents within noun phrases are much denser in Abstract than in PLS. Particularly, the Abstract provided a more detailed account of the research site and approach, whereas such information, as marked by the squared brackets, was not found in the PLS. Consequently, massve noun phrases such as a highly sensitie fluorescence induction and relaxation system only occurred in the Abstract excerpt but not inthe PLS excerpt. The reduced use of phrasa dependents in PLS writing corresponds with the intended improvement in readability for PLSs compared to Abstract, as complex syntactic structures at the phrasal level diminish overall readability (Crossley et al., 2023).

Specifically, PLSs had fewer noun and adjective modifiers within the noun phrase than Abstracts, as llustrated by Examples 6(a) to 7(b).

6(a) Ocean surface gravity waves can modulate the upper ocean circulation and vertical mixing through air-sea interactions, wave breaking. (JGRO_2021_027_Abstract)

![](img/03bee4e73f18117d6ccee6ecdd332d679dc6c328c61bf3b96a8f1b0c969f6f87.jpg)

6(b) Waves interact with currents to change the circulation in the upper wind mixed layer of the ocean. (JGR0_2021_027 PLS) 7(a) We suggest that temperature does drive long-term, multi-decadal patterns in $\Delta f C O _ { 2 }$ While additional time series are needed to confirm [the seasonal and annual trajectory of $C O _ { 2 }$ changes and ocean acidification in these dynamic and spatially complex ecosystems]. (JGRO_2021_043_Abstract)   
7(b) While our study shows that climate change can impact $\underline { { C O _ { 2 } } }$ uptake by changing ocean temperatures and ocean plant activity, it is unclear if these changes are permanent or temporary. More data and research are esential to better understand these trends. (JGRO_2021_043_PLS)

Examples 6(a) and 6(b) ilustrate the usage of nouns as modifiers per nominal subject. In Example 6(a), the nominal head waves is modified by ocean surface gravity. Example 6(b) instead adopts the bare noun wave. In other words, the PLS used a more concise reference to the entity than the Abstract.

Examples 7(a) and 7(b) pertain to the use of adjective modifiers per nominal in the PLS and the Abstract of the same article. Seven adjectival modifiers, in bold in Example 7(a), were used in the Abstract, whereas no adjectival modifiers were found in the PLS in Example 7(b). The phrase long-term, multi-decadal patterns in $\Delta f C O _ { 2 }$ in the Abstract was simplified to $C O _ { 2 }$ uptake in the PLS. In addition, the complex nominal the seasonal and annual trajectory of $C O _ { 2 }$ changes and ocean acidification in these dynamic and spatially complex ecosystems, wt our djectival modifier, was rela with a shl oun phrase (.. the trend in th . llof the above examples indicate that the Abstracts utilized more complex noun phrases with additional adjective modifiers, while such complex nominals were often replaced by shellnouns or omitted to achieve a more succinct rference in the PLSs. The results of specific measures of noun phrase complexity align with those of more general measures, as previously discussed, consistent with Crossley et al's (2023) argument that a higher number of complex nominals is negatively associated with text readability.

Collectively, the syntactic complexity differences between PLSs and Abstracts correspond with the intended enhancement in readability for PLSs, as supported by a set of established readability-related features, including sentence length, the number of subordinate clause, and phraal dependents. Additionall, the identified syntactic complexity variances between Ps and Astracts bear some resemblance to the distinctions identified by Biber and Gray (2010) and Biber (2012) regarding conversation and academic writing. Notably, PLSs and conversation favor the use of active voice and subordinate clauses to a greater extent than Abstracts and academic writing. This linguistic choice contributes to a more conversational tone in PLSs and aligns with the overarching goal of ensuring accessbility and engagement for a non-specialist audience. In contrast, Abstracts and academic writing feature a larger number of sophisticated noun phrases, adhering to the precision requirements of scholarly discourse and catering to a specialized readership with substantial subject knowledge.

# 5. Conclusion

This study compares the syntactic complexity of Abstracts and PLs of research articles in Marine Science. Our results reveal various aspects of syntactic complexity where Abstracts and PLSs diverge. In short, Abstracts contain longer production units and more complex noun phrases with a higher number of dependents than PLSs. Conversely, PLSs use more subordination and nominal subjects per clause, a characteristic related to a preference for active voice, than Abstracts. These inter-genre differences in syntactic complexity highlight certain features of PLSs: structural expansion, a reduction in research specifics, a propensity to foreground author/subject and a conversational tone.

From a pedagogical perspective, the linguistic distinctions identified between PLSs and Abstracts in this study yield valuable insights for both expert and student academic writers. Our analysis reveals syntactic variations between Abstracts and PLSs across various dimensions and provides authentic paired examples that can serve as instructional and reading materials t facilitate writers transition from more academic to les academic discourse, or vice versa. For expert international publication writers, we identify commonly used linguistic devices in the PLS genre, such as subordinate clauses, active voice, shorter sentences and fewer modifiers within noun phrases, thereby enhancing their understanding of this emerging new genre. The results also suggest that disciplinary experts should consider presenting less information in PLSs compared to Abstracts. For novice student writers unaccustomed to aademic writing, the comparative analysis in this study contribute to raising ther awarenes of the importance of aligning writing with purpose and audience, as well as understanding the phrasally complex nature of Abstracts.

While the current investigation was limited to the discipline of Marine Science, the identified differences between PLSs and Abstracts in this study have a potential to be extended to other disciplines. To validate this, further investigations into a wider range of disciplines are needed. Future studies are also recommended to examine the potential disciplinary inluence on syntactic complexity features of PLs and Abstracts. Additionall, integration of functional analysis with quantitative analysis of syntacticomplexity, as calld for by Lu et al. (2020), is necessary for a thorough understanding of the variances between PLs and Abstracts in terms of ther realization of rhetorical moves and steps.
