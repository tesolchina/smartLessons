The authors would like to note the following corrections to the final version of the above-mentioned article:

The abstract states that 328 open access RAs citing the seed article were collected. The correct number is 333, as reported in Table 1.   
On page 4, it states that frequencies were normalised to 100,000 words. The data were normalised to 10,000, as shown in the results.   
 In the second paragraph of section 4.2, the paragraph concludes with a direction to “see Table 4”. This should instead state “see Table 3”.

The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.
