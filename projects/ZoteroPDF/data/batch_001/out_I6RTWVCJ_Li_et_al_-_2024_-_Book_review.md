Think-aloud protocols (TAPs), as a method of examining the cognitive behaviors of human beings, have been widely used to analyze the thinking proesse of lrners in the field of language edcation such as reding, writing, traslatio, testing, and leaning strategies. Notwithstanding the paramount significance of TAPs in terms of revealing the strategic decisions learners make in learning and performing tasks, they have en long critiqued for their failure in guaranteeing such isus as reactivity and veridicalit Jordano & Touron, 2018). The book entitled Think-Aloud Protocols in Second Language Writing: A Mixed-Methods Study of Their Reactivity and Veridicality (Yang & Zhang, 2023) is thus a timely and insightful response to these issues.

Grounded on an empirical study designed to address the issues of reactivity and veridicality of TAPs in second language (L2) writing research, the aforementioned book provides a valuable guide for researchers, practitioners, and learners in L2 writing and beyond. Specificall, the book examines how TAPs exert ffects on the performance of L2 writing tasks of learners on 85 non-English. major sophomores at one key university in Northwest China, and whether such effects are moderated by writing proficiency and working memory. This nine-chapter volume consists of three parts: Part (Chapter 1-2) provides a foundation for the study including the introduction of the background, areview of previous studies, and the methodological basis of the study. Part II (Chapters 4-7) presents the quantitative and qualittie reults on the rectivity and veridcality of TAPs respectively. Par I (Chapter 89 discusses the major reults of the study, summarizes the main findings, points out the limitations, and suggests altenative efective ways to use TAPs in L2 writing research.

This monograph commences with an intention to construct the significance of the research reported in the book on the validity of TAPs. Chapter 1 clarifie the conceptual issues regarding what TAPs are and how TAPs distinguish themselves from altenative forms of verbal reports. The clarification thus functions as a backdrop for further discussion of the validity ssues of TAPs. Then to underscore the methodological position of TAPs in the exploration of human thinking, Chapter 1 introduces the appication of TAPs in language research, particularly writing reearch Itis against this background that the long-exsting validity issues are presented What is noted at the end of Chapter 1 is the scarcity of empirical studes on the validity isues of TAPs in L2 writing. Chapter rationalizes the study by reviewing pertinent thoughts and empirical studies on the validity of TAPs. This chapter identifies the gaps in existing literature in terms of inconsistent results with regard to reactivity and inadequate evidence of veridicality. Underpinned by the gaps identified in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 elaborates the design of this mixed-methods study, regarding the participants, the experimental design, and the identification, measurement, and analysis of reactivity and veridicality of TAPs among the participants.

Part II encompasses four chapters, covering results of reactivity from quantitative analyses of performance (Chapter 4), results of reactivit from qualitative analyses of reflections (Chapter 5), reults of veridicality from qualitative analyses of reflctions (Chapter 6), and results of veridicalit from a comparison of reports (Chapter 7). Specifically, Chapter 4 reports the effcts of thinking aloud activities on the 20 measures of L2 writing performance including that thinking aloud has asignificant efect in decreasing two of the 20 measures. Results of reactivity from qualitative analyses of reflections among the participants are presented in Chapter 5. The participants revealed ambivalent attitudes towards the efect of thinking aloud actvities. Whereas most of the participants deemed thinking aloud activities to be detrimental, a smal fraction of them considered them facilitative and only two of them indicated no effect. The authors ientified prominent causes, including the diversin of atention, not being accustomed to thinking loud ativities, and being recorded, that might account for the participants perceived undesirable effct of TAPs. The authors also found such reasons as promoting thinking and enhancing memory for the perceived facilitative efect of TAPs. Chapter 6 describes the results of verid. cality from qualitative analyses of reflections. This chapter found discrepancy with regard to the participants' atitude towards TAPS.

Approximately one third of the participants displayed a negative attitude towards the completeness of TAPs, while most of them offered a positive reponse. he participants overall pressed their support for the accuracy f TPs as justifid in ther reections on complying with, sensing no challenges with, and experiencing no scruples in reporting. By contrast, the suggested reasons for the inaccuracy of TAPs mainly include the participants' dificulty in acquiring exact expression of thoughts, incompleteness and reac. tivity. Chapter 7 further compares the ults of vridcality fm he reorts of the aticipants. It i ndicated that veal they d not offer sound evidence for the veridicality of TAPs. They could not oncurrently report what was happening in their minds that they were supposed to report.

Part II includes two chapters which respectively discuss the major findings of the study (Chapter 8) and acknowledge its imitations as well as ofer sugestions of alternative ways t apply TAPs in L2 writing studies (Chapter 9). Chapter 8 frst summarizes the major findings of the study. The authors found that TAPs exert negative efects on L2 writing performance and that there are individual differences in these effcts. The chapter then claims the studyscontribution by highlighting its confirmation of previous observations regarding the native effct of TAPs on rectivity and lner differnes, and its echment of existing iterature (Bowles, 2010). As for the veridicality of TAPs, tis chapter concludes that TAPs could not completely reflect certain thinking processes given that these omissions of thoughts might fall into what isclaimed to be nonverbalizable processes. Finally, Chapter 9 summarizes the major conclusions of the study, acknowledges its limitations, and puts forward some suggestions for further research on TAPs in L2 writing.

Overall, this book presents a systematic study of reactivity and veridicalit of TAPs in L2 writing research and could serve as an insightful guide for how the isues of reactivity and veridicality of TAPs could be efectively addressed in L2 writing research and in other similar domains. The whole volume is of profound significance in terms of theory, methods, and pedagogy for researchers, practitioners, and learners in the field of L2 writing research and others.

The book offers a holistic picture of the reactivity and veridicality isues of TAPs, thus creating several theoretical implications for research on reactivity and veridicality of TAPs in the field of applied linguistics, second language acquisition, and L2 writing in particular. The research reported in the book could be used to validate previously proposed theories regarding L2 teaching and research, particularl L2 writing research. The book thus serves as a continuation of attention paid to the issues of reactivity and veridicalit of TAPs in L2 studies ince 2004 when researchers began to addres them (Bowles, 2010). A second contribution of this book is its systematic exploration of the reactivity and veridicalit issues of TAPs in L2 writing research, which provides theoretical guidance for future aplication of TAPs into L2 writing research. Though TAPs have been widely employed i previous studies (Kim & Bowles, 2019), research on the reactivity and veridicality of TAPs in L2 writing remains a massve untapped field. The book thus enriches the literature of TAPs in L2 writing research. The book delves deeply into these two concerns of TAPs in L2 writing, and has significant implications for researchers who are dedicated to verbal reports studies.

Credits also go to the design of the study, whose validit is guaranteed through the groups of controlled experiments as well as control of variables. Various factors, whether individual or contextual can regulate the potential influence f think-aloud activities on task pefmance (Willy & Tanmoto, 2015). As ault, rerchrs ned o take the effct f th variables in account In order to compare across groups and exclude the interference of other factors on the study outcomes, parameters in addition to the targets of experimental measures, such as working memory capacity (WMC) and baseline L2 writing performance, were kept as consistent as possible in the study. These individual factors were examined in advance, and participants in the subsequent TAP experiment were grouped based on these experimental findings. These operations thus significantly add to the rigor of the study's procedures and increase the credibility of its conclusions.

Another admirable uces of this study lies in theemployment of trianglation to adressth ssue of rectivity and veidcality of TAPs. On the one hand, the selecive behavior of verbal report, unconscious thoughts, and thoughts that are inaccessible by means of verbal report are allikely to contribute to the incompletenes of think-aloud reports. Thus, a supplementary means that can manifest this overlooked information is of colosal importance. By taking advantage of retrospective verbal reports (RVRs) immediately after the TAPs, participants can optimize the retrieval of these missed messages through the experimenters instructions, which could supplement results of TAP reports and assist the evaluation of the completenessof TAPs (Chapters 6 & 7). On the other hand, one of the most significant ssues is the lack of absolute benchmarks to verify whether the results produced by TAPs are veridical (Yang & Zhang, 2015). That is tosay, it remains unknown as to what constitutes a complete and acrate thought proces. Under these circumstances, a proven strategy is adopted by Yang and Zhang to compare the TAP reports and the data obtained by RVRs, o as to asess whether the TAP is veridical and to what extent itis veridical. In terms of reactivity, the study gauges the changes in multiple dimensions of writing performance, y which the reactivity of TAPs in the writing proces is wellilluminated. In an effort t reflect the changes in writing performance accurately and comprehensively, the authors made descriptive statistics of 20 measures of baseline performance and observed the variations in thee 20 measures after employing TAPs in the writing proces. This practice concrtiz as wellas quantifies the changes in performance, which informs the overal changes in writig performance and further indicates the reactivity of TAPs in the writing proces. The triangulated design of the study reported in this book thus offers a methodological reference for gauging reactivity and veridicality of TAPs in L2 writing research and beyond.

Pedagogicall, this study is instrumental in promoting the teaching and learning of L2 writing. Focusing on the reactivity and veridicality isue f TAPs, this study not only reveals some detrimental effect of TAPs on writing performance, it also further points out that such negative effect i solely limited to several peripheral aspects. Despite concerns regarding the reactivity and veridicalit of TAPs (Zhang & Zhang, 2020), the researchers view it as a trustworthy methodological choice in L2 research if it is operated and interpreted with caution (Zhang & Zhang, 2020). Hence despite the minor side effects, the significance of TAPs as a tool for studying writing procses can stillbe afirmed. For sudts, when techrs share thir thought procees f wtig, ds are able to eenot only the actions that take place, but also the thinking needed to execute those actions, which is to make students aware of successul strategies to improve their reading and writing capacities (Pratt & Hodges, 2023). For teachers, TAPs constitute a useful instrument to identify the slf-regulated writing strategies their students already use and the writing problems they are faced with (Bai, 2018). In brief, if the isues f reactivity and veridicality are well addresed, TAPs could provide valuable reearch tool for examining student misconceptions, improving assessments and course materials, and improving the teaching of L2 writing (Reinhart et al., 2022).

Nevertheles, despite the aforementioned values, the book also has certain disadvantages. Firstly, the study mainly collects the data about the completeness, acuracy, and fluency of the participants' immediate retrospective verbal reports. However,little consider ation is taken of the variety of participants' immediate memory and sensitivity to the writing question (Guitard & Cowan, 2023) Theorists have also posited that the ned for reflection may depend on context Secondy, when focusing on the results of participants verbal reports and working memory tests about reactivity, it would be more rigorous and comprehensive if researchers could take measures to provide participants appropriat intructions, train them more on purpose, and alleviate their anxiety, which can reduce reactivity and improve the veridicality of TAPs (Yang & Zhang, 2015). For another reason, there is no definite answer to the question of reactivity, which is constrained by an array of variables such as learners proficiency level of the language used in think-aloud protocols according to Sachs and Polio (2007), learners target language proficiency levels, and the measures of reactivity such as ac. curacy, reaction time, and time on task (Bowles, 2010). Thirdy, the authors tat that theffects of the reactivity of TAPs may invole diversion of attention and participants' lack of familiarity with TAPs. Thus, the cognitive resources llocated to the writing task would be limited during the think-aloud activitie. Last but not least, the book focuses on the effect of TAPs upon L2 writing. The effect of TAPs in learning tasks of other language skill such as reading, grammar, and vocabulary also deserves scholarship.

In a nutshll the few shortcomings mentioned above do not overshadow the contributions of the book to TAP studies. Rather, the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical values together with any existing established merits could inform readers of the fun damentals and strengths of TAPs as well as concerns over reactivity and veridicality in the sphere of L2 writing research and beyond. Therefore, it is highly recommended that researchers, practitioners, and learners who are dedicated to L2 writing research and teaching use the book as a tool guide for research, instruction, and learning..
