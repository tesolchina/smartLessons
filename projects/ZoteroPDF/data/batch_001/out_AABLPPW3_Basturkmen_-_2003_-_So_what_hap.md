# Abstract

A central concern in English for academic purposes is description of language use in target language events. In regard to spoken language use, research has aimed to describe the general features of talk across talking to learn events and to identify the speaking needs of ESL students in them. The study reported in this article takes a narrow-angled approach to description and offers an in-depth analysis of interaction patterns in just one example of one type of speaking event—the discussion class. The data comprised a video recording of a naturally occurring Master of Business Administration (MBA) discussion group before and after the unexpected arrival of the tutor. The study investigated the ways the presence and absence of the tutor impacted on the interaction, specifically on ‘exchange structures’ [Coulthard, M. & Brazil, D. (1992). Exchange structure. In M. Coulthard (Ed.), Advances in spoken discourse analysis. London: Routledge]. Analysis revealed distinctive characteristics of interaction with and without the tutor, indicating in particular the greater degree of other-oriented mutuality in the former. It is argued that findings from in-depth analyses of spoken discourse such as this can provide valuable insights for language description.

# 1. Introduction

Description of language use in target language situations is often regarded as the primary focus of research in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) (Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001). A central concern in EAP has been to describe types of language use in target language events and to use these descriptions to inform curriculum design.

The use of spoken language has not received the same degree of attention as other areas of language use. Research into the nature of talking for learning in higher education settings has been limited (Stokoe, 2000) and relatively little research has focused on the development of EAP speaking skills compared to other skills areas, especially writing (Robinson, Strong, Whittle, & Nobe, 2001). Generally the skill of speaking is perceived to be less important than other language skills for success in tertiary level education (Elder, Erlam, & von Randow, 2002; Rosenfeld, Leung, & Oltman, 2001).

On the other hand, tutorials and other modes of instruction based on discussion are increasingly popular in education (Brown & Alkins, 1988). As students progress in their tertiary level studies, speaking becomes increasingly important. For example, postgraduate programs tend to involve more seminars and discussion-based classes than undergraduate programs. Research shows that although ESL students may not perceive speaking to be very important in terms of objective needs, they tend to perceive it as important subjectively (Furneaux, Locke, Robinson, & Tonkyn, 1991).

If EAP courses are to target speaking skills, they need to be informed by descriptions of speaking in the types of learning events the students will need to participate in. A survey by Ferris (1998) of ESL students in three different US universities found that most courses the students were taking required participation in small group interaction. Small group interaction is, however, a broad term. Amongst other things, the term can refer to small groups of students working alone or to students working in small groups with a tutor or faculty member.

The study reported in this article examined interaction in a small group discussion before and after the arrival of the tutor. Pittman (1999) and Ellis (1999) maintain that sequential patterns of interaction reflect participants’ notions of their identities in talk and their concurrence in them. We expected, therefore, that the presence or absence of an authority figure, the tutor, would be reflected in differences in the patterns of exchange.

The literature reports a number of specific ways in which authority figures control talk. Drew and Heritage (1992) investigated questioning in doctor–patient interviews and found that the doctors asked more questions and thus controlled the agenda. Lineel (1990) and Lineel, Gustavsson, and Juvonen (1988) investigated unequal encounters to find that the dominant party controlled initiative-response sequences. Thonus (1999) studied tutors’ use of directive speech acts in academic writing tutorials and found that tutors used directives constantly, regardless of the gender or proficiency in English of the students. Berry (1981) shows how differences in both knowledge and authority between speakers lead to different exchange patterns.

Research in education also shows that tutors or faculty members tend to dominate university discussion. Bashiruddin, Edge, and Hughes-Pelegrin (1990) found the lecturer spoke more than three times as much as the student participants at a postgraduate linguistics seminar. Brown and Alkins (1988) report research showing tutor talk made up $8 6 \%$ of talking time and student–student interaction was as low as $8 \%$ in seminars and discussions. Evans (1983) compared a 15 student group tutor-led seminar discussion with student-led seminars of seven participants to find that in the former a number of students did not participate, and virtually only the tutor practised the functions of summarising, rephrasing and making procedural suggestions. In the groups without a tutor, more of these behaviours were practised by students, the ideas expressed were more varied and divergent and the students were more likely to express ‘half-formed’ ideas. Baumgart (1976) studied group tutorials (10–12 participants) in an Australian university to find that tutors typically made more than a third of all moves and more than two-thirds of structuring and soliciting moves. Students made the great majority of responding and reacting moves.

# 2. The study

This leads us to the present study, the aim of which was to add to the language description of talking for learning events for EAP. The study examined exchange patterns in a small group discussion in relation to the presence and absence of the tutor. The data for the study comprised a video recording of a naturally occurring small group discussion class from the MBA program at Aston University, a program that regularly video-records its classes of in-house students. The recordings are made available to students on the distance-learning program. For the present study a recording showing a tutorial discussion group before and after the unexpected arrival of a tutor was selected.

The group discussion followed a lecture on the topic of Innovation in Business. After the lecture the students broke into small groups of three to six and proceeded to various rooms to discuss a case study scenario related to the topic of the lecture. Some rooms were fitted out with video recording equipment. The recording used in the study was made by non-obtrusive means without the presence of the researcher. It is the system on the program that a tutor may or may not join in on one of the group discussions. Generally, the tutor arrives at the outset if joining a group.

The recording used in the present study showed a group of three students. Two students were native speakers of English and one was a native speaker of French who was highly proficient in English. The students were in their mid-twenties and all had a limited number of years of work experience in business. For the first half of the session, the students worked independently as a peer group. Halfway through, however, a tutor unexpectedly appeared and joined the group.

The recording was transcribed. Tracy and Naughton (1994) assert that the appropriate level to transcribe is always dependent on a particular study’s aim. Given that the research interest in the study was on identifying exchange patterns, transcription was made at an intermediate level of detail. This included the words that were said, and partial formulations and overlaps, but did not include pronunciation peculiarities or intonational stresses. Overlaps were recorded by using the symbol nn to indicate where a speaker took a turn from another before completion or overlap began. Overlapping parts are presented in the transcriptions as parallel to each other (see example 1).

Example 1   
1. Student: That’s what we were trying nn to do   
2. Tutor: nn Right and what was the reason for that?

One of the salient features of interaction in academic discussion is the considerable length of many turns. As a result, during one turn there may be a number of backchannelling realisations such as Yes, Hmm etc. as well as attempts by other speakers to take the floor with verbal means. Non-verbal means of attempting to take the floor had only been partially recorded by the videos. Non-verbal means were not recorded in the transcriptions. Back-channelling and unsuccessful verbal attempts to take the floor were recorded by inserting them in brackets into the transcription of the turn in progress. Although this is not a recognised transcription convention, as turns in academic discussion are often long, this procedure allowed the turns to still appear as wholes and facilitated analysis of the exchanges (see example 2).

# Example 2

1. Student 1: We were not interested in the profit made because of the low income generating practice of (Tutor: Right) and what they reported was (Student 3 What I ) that there were higher returns in the public sector than $= = = = = = =$

Following transcription, the text was analysed for patterns of ‘exchange structure’ (Coulthard & Brazil, 1992). A number of analysts of spoken discourse use the construct of exchange structure to identify sequential patterns in dyadic talk (Hoey, 1992; Tsui, 1989, 1994). This construct was originally developed from observations of talk in primary school classrooms (Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975), but has been applied to analysis of talking to learn events in higher education (Basturkmen, 1995, 2000; Tapper, 1992, 1996). The approach presents spoken discourse as a hierarchical structure composed of transactions, at the most general level, which are made up of exchanges (the level of dyadic talk). Exchanges are made up of moves (what one party wants to achieve through interaction), and moves are made up of one or more acts (the most specific level). An exchange is the basic unit of interaction and comprises minimally an initiating move and a responding move. Prospectiveness, or predictive capacity, is a central tenet of the approach and interpretations of spoken discourse are made on the basis of the move that is or is not expected sequentially. An expectation is set up by the initiating move and the subsequent move is classified according to this expectation. An initiation is not expected or predicted but is up to the free will of the participants. However, once an initiation is made it sets up an expectation of a response. A follow-up move is optional and if uttered does not set up the expectation of a further move. Table 1, from Coulthard and Brazil (1992: 71), illustrates this.

Exchanges in teacher-fronted classrooms are generally found to have a three-part exchange structure of I (initiation), R (response) and F (follow-up): example 3 illustrates such an exchange. In this exchange the initiating move is realised by an act of elicitation (question), the responding move by an act of reply and the followup move is realised by the two acts, accept and evaluate.

(Sinclair & Coulthard, 1992: 25)

More extensive patterns of exchange may occur. Hoey (1992) identifies some extended exchange patterns in conversation comprising two or more simple exchanges; one such complex exchange is shown in example 4. Here, the follow-up to a response functions as re-initiation. Hoey (1992: 77) discusses this pattern saying, ‘What drives this pattern is that a negative evaluation of a response indicates that the original initiation has not been properly responded to; naturally this places pressure on the listeners to produce a better response. It can occur with any initiation but is most common with question initiations.’

# Example 4

1. A: What’s kept in that cupboard? initiation   
2. B: Just some old clothes and things. response   
3. A: Oh I thought it might be something exciting. follow-up treated as initiation   
4. B: No, I’m afraid not, unless you find response   
old fashions exciting.

(Hoey, 1992: 75)

In the present study, exchange structures were identified in the transcription. The patterns of exchange in the discussion of the students working alone were compared to those in the discussion of the students working with the tutor to see whether the same types of exchanges were evident and in which ways, if any, the interaction was qualitatively distinct.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Interaction without the tutor

It was difficult to identify exchange patterns in the student peer interaction. Cheung (1984) used the construct of exchange structure to investigate student peer interaction in a simulated small group discussion and found that the interaction was only superficially different from the very structured teacher–pupil interaction of the classroom. This finding was due to the fact that one student assumed the role of the teacher and there were a series of binary interactions: either one to many, as in the classroom, or one to one. Cheung found that although the IRF pattern was present, the more prevalent pattern was the two-part IR pattern. Unlike Cheung’s findings, the analysis of the MBA tutorial showed that in the student peer group discussion, no one student assumed leadership of the talk, although at various points each of the three students tried to structure the discourse by eliciting the others’ responses to the set questions (see example 5).

# Example 5

1. Student 1: So what do you think the source of innovation is I think it is more the need that exists in the company an any company in the UK because at eh beginning of the case we just know nn that it   
2. Student 2: nn Yeah I thought that the need the latent need was there in the airline companies for an information system $= = = = = = =$

In example 5 it is noticeable that the same student 1 starts responding to what appeared to be his own elicit and it is not clear whether student 1’s move should be identified as an initiation or response or both. To an extent it appears as an initiation since student 2 makes a response, but that response is not addressed to the elicit but rather to student 1’s response to his own elicit. In other words, the students appropriated each others’ discourse functions. This made analysis into $^ { \mathrm { ~ I ~ R ~ } }$ slots of dubious usefulness.

In the previous example, student 1 responded to his own elicit. In example 6, student 3 responds to what appears to be an elicit by student 2 addressed to student 1:

# Example 6

1. Student 1: The market didn’t exist because there wasn’t actually a need.   
2. Student 2: Do you think so?   
3. Student 3: Yeah

A further feature observed was the occurrence of split turns. To identify the boundaries of a turn in such cases (and thus moves in exchanges) was therefore problematic. Example 7 illustrates what appears to be a split turn.

# Example 7

1. Student 1: As far as guitarists were concerned they did want a way of playing the synthesiser without using the keyboards so as far as professional players were concerned they were interested in a system like this nn that’s what I see   
2. Student 2: nn Only the professionals   
3. Student 1: Only the professional that’s right so it was a limited niche market and $= = = = =$

On the surface, this extract seems to be: student 1 initiates, student 2 responds and student 1 follows up with an evaluative That’s right and some extra information. On the other hand because student 1’s first turn is interrupted, only the first part of turn 3 can be seen as follow-up and the final part can be seen as the continuation of his initiation. This kind of re-initiation due to interruption was also identified by Cheung (1984) as being widespread in small group discussion.

The peer group discussion without a specified leader was characterised by sequences of interaction in which students added ideas to the discussion. This adding to the topic was not necessarily achieved through statement/counter-statement or question/answer dialectic couplets but rather through throwing out ideas, so what emerged was a piling up of contributions (see example 8).

# Example 8

1. Student 1: It says here very clearly that the pilots were frustrated by the lack of development in the research and development department and asked if any of the flight crew knew anything about computer programming (Student 2: Right) so this was a problem that existed and the management didn’t have the insight to enforce or pass to the research and development department something about it.   
2. Student 2: What I can see here is like there is a lack of management in each company because no one took care of the problems of the pilots.   
3. Student 3: There’s not a tech at Dan Air there’s not a technical manager so to speak I mean there’s someone on the ground crew there’s someone who does the marketing and what not but Dan Air buys the planes from other organisations and there’s not

4. Student 2: Yes but why don’t they develop the program.

To an extent this string of contributions of ideas displays a lack of co-ordination between speakers. It is not interaction of the kind produced in conversation or led discussion, where contributions create a chain reaction, each affecting the next. Each speaker in these strings seems primarily concerned with the subject matter in hand; the speakers add to its development but do not interact with each other. In other words these strings, which were characteristic of the non-led discussion group, were heavily topic-focused and only marginally other-speaker focused, giving the impression of interlocutors somewhat out of synchrony. Thus it is argued here that not all multi-party spoken discourse can be seen as truly interactive. In this case the participants were concerned with adding their ideas to the discussion but these ideas were not necessarily taken up, responded to or commented on by the others and indeed perhaps they were not intended to evoke response or even acknowledgement. Applying the same descriptive system as used in tutor-led interaction simply reveals a number of sequences of marginal structural interest, to be coded as a series of informing initiations.

A further feature of non-led discussion was that speakers tended to reassert the topic of their previous turn, and seemed oblivious to the content of intervening turns. The turn-initial ‘‘yeahs’’ ‘‘yeses’’ or ‘‘buts’’ in such cases had little significance. This feature is illustrated in example 9. Here ‘‘yeah’’ and ‘‘but’’ are used together in turn 3 even though the move in turn 3 neither supports nor challenges the ideas in turn 2. Rather it appears as a new initiation, as does the move in turn 4.

# Example 9

1. Student 1: Yeah but who buys the musical instruments I mean   
2. Student 2: The person who wants to play alone maybe at home the guitar as well It’s the fact that with the product you already have the guitar you can have an extension a synthesiser   
3. Student 1: Yeah but people tend to mimic especially in the music world they tend to mimic famous people already yeah then if no one famous is using this product then everybody’ll going to go you know Mark Lee doesn’t use this system so I’m not going to buy it   
4. Student 3: But I would say that as far as the market for this particular product is concerned the majority of the market would be amateurs who are buying a product and this product is a very expensive product because of the technical

# 3.2. Interaction with the tutor present

Analysis of the interaction where the tutor was present revealed that simple I R exchanges (initiating move followed by a responding move) predominated, and some I R F exchanges (initiating move, responding moves and follow-up move) were also evident. The I R exchange pattern is illustrated in example 10.

Example 10   
Initiation 1. Tutor: Do you do you think there was market opportunity for any of these or do you think they were market driven or technology driven   
Response 2. Student: Speed Data would be market driven I would say rather than technology driven because there was a basic need

An extended variant of the above pattern, I R F/I R (initiation, response, followup as initiation and response), was also found to be much in evidence.

The $\mathrm { F / I }$ move was observed to develop the exchange by indicating that a satisfactory outcome to the exchange has not been reached. Thus the I R F/I R pattern indicated development of discussion beyond simple question answer couplets. It indicated the critical response to the ideas or information given in the responding move. This is evident in example 11.

# Example 11

n 1. Student: I don’t know what what the legislation is for CDs but I mean if they’d invented it surely surely they could have done something with it

Response 2. Tutor: Well unless they took out patents they don’t have $( \mathbf { S } 2 \mathbf { N } \mathbf { o } )$ any rights at all   
Follow up 3. Student: Yeh but that seems silly doesn’t it it does seem silly well perhaps they invented it there wasn’t actually a market they needed the collaboration of record companies (T: Mmm) to actually produce records on compact discs for there to be a market to sell CD players perhaps it was a wrong time they should maybe have invented it and kept it on the sidelines and keep it secretive until when they actually negotiated record contracts   
Response 4. Tutor: Well this does actually say this was patented by the companies so they must have got something out of it

Approximately half of all exchanges were initiated by the tutor (see example 10) and half by the students (see example 11).

In tutor-initiated exchanges, the tutors used the $\mathrm { F / I }$ slot to probe the students. In the extract below (example 12), the tutor gives critical follow-up, showing dissatisfaction with the response given and pushing the student’s thinking forward toward the conclusion or generalisation he had in mind.

# Example 12

Response 1. Student: They were users they were current users one was a pilot and one was a musician and they both developed they both understood a need a personal need and they developed that as commercial   
Follow-up 2.Tutor: Right so you found a variable in terms of user dominated   
as initiation innovation?   
Response 3. Student: Yeah   
Follow-up 4. Tutor: So yes there’s 2 instances of that?   
as initiation   
Response 5. Student: Yeah   
Follow-up 6. Tutor: OK so can you see the slight distinction between the two   
as initiation though within that?   
Response 7. Student: $\mathrm { U m } + \mathrm { I }$ think so $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { I } } = \boldsymbol { \mathrm { = } } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { = } } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { = } } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { = } } \boldsymbol { \mathrm { = } }$

A further feature of tutor-initiated exchange patterns was the prevalence of exchange-final follow-up moves by the tutor. Many of these were lengthy and involved the tutor in expanding on the topic, as can be seen in turn 3, example 13.

# Example 13

Initiation 1. Tutor: What do you think links these two companies together more than Air Data if we look at the second question which was referring to the internal external

Response 2. Student: As researchers as head of the company   
Follow-up 3.Tutor: Well it was partly developments internally but it was an adaptation of external developments so they had to take in knowledge and expertise from the two companies to adapt their product so it was a combination but they needed that knowledge to be able to develop a working product and so you see the usage of external knowledge and external suppliers components

One of the functions of the follow-up move in tutor-initiated exchanges would seem to be for the tutor to input information to the group. Although the discussion group was not primarily a lecture, the tutor still wished to impart information and the follow-up slot following from the elicit-response sequence provided the opportunity to do so.

This report has highlighted some of the distinctive features of interaction revealed by the analysis of exchange patterns in a student peer group discussion and a discussion by the same students with the tutor. In the following section I consider the implications of these results for EAP.

# 4. Discussion and concluding remarks

The analysis from this study has implications for the description of spoken English for academic purposes. Firstly, it offers some insights into how the presence or absence of an authority figure may impact on the nature of academic discussion. In interaction with the presence of the tutor, half the exchanges were initiated by students. Therefore, the results did not show that the authority figure dominated by controlling the interaction, i.e. by initiating exchanges. This contrasts with a number of findings from the literature concerning the effect of an authority figure on interaction (e.g. Drew & Heritage, 1992). Analysis revealed a basic pattern of initiation– response. It also showed variations on this basic pattern, noticeably the occurrence of $\mathrm { F / I }$ moves to extend exchanges and also the use of follow-up by tutors for a range of ‘teaching’ functions.

The analysis indicated that the arrival of the tutor impacted on the discussion in two interrelated ways. Firstly, the discussion became more solution driven rather than ideas focused. Secondly, it became more mutually other-oriented. One aspect of two- or multi-party talk is that speakers orientate themselves to one another and each other’s contributions to talk1 . In this type of talk mutuality is enacted through the co-operative exchange of ideas and information through interactive routines such as initiation and response. This mutual other-orientation was constituted in exchange structures, that is, interaction largely made up of moves that were responded to by another or elicited responses from another. In the student peer group interaction, students’ contributions to talk (moves) were less clearly oriented towards one another in a mutually responsive relationship. Here, the talk was a free flowing of ideas and contributions, and students’ utterances were almost disconnected except at the level of topic or content. As a result the discussion did not progress in rounds of exchanges.

Secondly, the analysis revealed two distinct forms of talking for learning in this small group discussion. The possibility for distinct forms of talk to co-exist in academic speaking events is argued elsewhere (Basturkmen, 2000). Discussion with the tutor involved predictable rounds of question and answer, response and counter response that reflected a type of pedagogy concerned with reaching solutions. It also reflected a mutual responsiveness with chains of interactive moves. The student peer group discussion involved contributions from students that did not necessarily elicit responses from any other student, and which was non-linear in that the students did not stay with one substantive area of content until it was exhausted but deviated and returned to former topics, etc. This form of talk reflected a more formative type of pedagogy, the contributing of half-formed ideas and their exploration.

The results of the analysis of this one sample of small group discussion cannot be over-generalised. Other small groups of students may interact differently. Possibly in other groups one student would take the leadership role. In other settings, students might be more mutually responsive in peer group discussion than the students in the present study. What general implication follows from the present study is that any one talking for learning event—seminar, tutorial, one-on-one student-faculty member conference—may involve different forms of speaking. EAP researchers and teachers should not assume that target language events comprise one form of discourse. Differences in forms of discourse may be related to changes in participant configuration (as in the present study) or possibly other contextual variables, such as difference in activity type or stages of the event. Further research is needed to establish the relationship between such contextual configurations and the nature of spoken interaction.

As an approach to analysis of spoken interaction in the classroom, the construct of exchange structure was useful for analysis of discussion with the tutor, that is, dyadic talk in which one party was in a more privileged speaking position. Exchanges could easily be identified and these exchanges accounted for the great majority of the transcription. The use of exchange structure was found to be problematic for analysis of talk in the student peer group. This suggests that exchange structure is less applicable to analysis of multi-party talk in which no one assumes a leadership role.

Developers of EAP speaking courses generally aim to identify the target situation speaking events their students will need to participate in. The present study has shown that events may comprise sub-events and that these can be quite distinct. The term ‘small group discussion’ may be used to denote student discussion with a tutor, student peer group discussion and potentially other sub-events as well. A seminar may comprise distinct sections, such as presentation, question time, tutor summary, etc. Developers of EAP speaking courses can usefully investigate very specifically the types of events that occur in the target situation and be cautious about broad terms, such as tutorial, seminar or group discussion. These terms can be applied to a range of event types, and only careful investigation may reveal exactly what is meant by these terms in any university department, what forms of talk may be involved and, crucially for learners of English, what specific demands are made by any one form of talk.
