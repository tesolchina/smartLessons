This study proposes a multi-pronged approach for examining office hour (OH) rapport management. Using an interactional sociolinguistic lens, I investigate how an international teaching assistant (ITA) managed rapport in the face of misunderstanding and schema mismatch during an OH consultation. Data were collected through classroom observations, OH video-recording, an exit survey, and follow-up interviews with participants to facilitate triangulation. Utilizing frame analysis and contextualization cues, I analyzed the strategies the ITA used to maintain and strengthen rapport with his international student. I show that a multi-method approach illuminates how participants' mismatch in schemas was displayed to one another at the interactional level, which led to rapport challenge and misunderstanding. I argue that using multiple methods is beneficial in revealing the intercultural nature of OH meetings where small c" culture (i.e., institutional culture) was negotiated. While previous research predominantly focused on face management, this study complexifies our understanding of rapport by highlighting the importance of managing (a) interactional goals and (b) rights and obligations, two under-researched bases of rapport.

# 1. Introduction

Office hour (OH) consultations offer students opportunities to meet their instructors face-to-face and receive academic support Research has shown that good instructor-student interactions positively influence new university students' retention rate (Kar. aivanova, 2016) and that students' grades and the frequency of their visits to instructors' offce are positively correlated (Cotten & Wilson, 2006; Guerro & Rod, 2013). Furthermore, student-istructor interactions have been found to benefit students "academic achievement, intellctual growth, personal development and colle or university persistence" (Hoffman, 2014, p. 14). However, as OH meetings inherently feature power imbalances and knowledge asymmetrie between teacher and student (Park, 2012), managing rapport is central to these meetings' outcomes.

House (2003) argues that we can only understand miscommunication by studying both linguisi forms and the speaker's intention in interaction, which aligns with the general principles of interactional sociolingustics (Is), an approach providing the tools to go "beyond the overt lexical information' (Gumperz, 2015, p. 312) and zoom in on interlocutors' schemas, how intentions are framed, and how the hearer aligns or fails to align with this real meaning" (House, 2003, p. 23). Accordingly, this study proposes a multi-method approach using IS to examine an OH meeting utilizing video data, observation notes, an exit survey, participant interviews, and member checking with the instructor. Drawing on Goffman's frame analysis (1974), Gumper's(1982) contextualization cues, and Spencer-Oatey's (2008) rapport management theory, I explore Hie's an intenational teaching asstant (ITA), strategies to manage rapport with Loren, an international student, and how thee strategies afect Loreen's pereptions and reactions. This study's multi-pronged approach elucidates new understandings of under-researched aspects of rapport, namely () interactional goals and (b) rights and obligations. I show that using multiple methods is beneficial in revealing the intricate link between interactional goals (Spencer-Oatey, 2008) and schema mismatch (Nishida, 199; Zhu, 2014) which manifest at the interaction level as rapport challenge and even misunderstanding in an intercultural OH meeting.

This paper illstrates the intersection of brought about (i.e., how meaning is created in the interaction), brought along (i.e., how interpretations are shaped by the schemas and past experiences), and their impact on rapport This was especially ppealing when one of the interlocutors oriented to rapport neglect or rapport challenge. Here I demonstrate how rapport was affected even when the student showed a Collboration orientation (Subtirelu, 2017). Although the ITA and his student considered the meeting successful in the end, the presence of rapport neglect, rapport challenge, and misunderstanding made it compelling to examine the multiple ways that the instructor managed rapport.

The current study sought to answer two questions.

1. What strategies does the instructor employ to manage rapport with the student in his OH meeting when their schemas clash?   
2. How does a multimethod approach to studying intercultural OH meetings expand understandings of OH interactions?

I intend to contribute methodologicall, first through proposing a multipronged approach for examining intercultural communi. cation in Hs. show that while national lture did not emerge s a key point in the data, OHs are stil intercltural precisely because of participants' diffrig schemas (i.., previous knowledge or past experiences that inform their behaviors). Since schemas are often invisible, the multi-method approach can iluminate how schemas are displayed interactionall. Secondly, OH interactions have rarely been analyzed with rapport management; therefore, fcusing on rapport management and especially interactional goals contributes to a more complex understanding of rapport. Previously, rapport research predominantly focused on face management. This study shows that even when the ITA avoided a face-threatening reques (i., elling thestudent what she needs to do), by choosing to guide her to her own conclusion, it negatively affected rapport. This was because the ITA's guiding frame did not align with the student's need to know exactly what to do. In other words, the student's interactional goals were more important to her (and therefore more meaningful to rapport) than face in this particular context.

# 1.1. Concepts

# 1.1.1. Rapport management

Helen Spencer-Oatey (2008) expanded Brown and Levinson's (1987) notion of "face" and developed the rapport management theory (RMT). She defined rapport as \*people's subjective perceptions of (dis)harmony, smoothness - turbulence and warmth - antagonism in interpersonal relations" (Spencer-Oatey, 2009, p. 102). Recent scholarship emphasizes both the harmonious and inharmonious aspects of rapport (Lauriks et al., 2015) and sees rapport as neutral (Zhang, 2019). Ths study isconcerned with how the harmonious relationship between the instructor and the student were challenged and eventually maintained.

According to Spencer-Oatey (2009), managing rapport involves (a) the negotiation of face, (b) sociality rights and obligations, and (c) interactional goal. She explained that individuals want otherstoview and acknowledge thir positive traits, not the negative ones. This is what Spencer-atey clld face. hen (2021, p.2)catgorizes ace into utonomy (fre to expres and determine for oneelf), quality face (valued for positive qualities, having one's competence and status acknowledged) and fellowship face (being a \*worthy companion'). People also hold certain expectations regarding others' behaviors, believing they have \*perceived socialit rights and obligations" (Spencer-Oatey, 2008, p. 15). This is based on two important notions: equity and asociation. Equity means individuals desire to be fre of unfair treatment and imposition. Association means individuals rights to choose the extent they engage or disengage in conversations with others. For example, when someone asks a personal question that makes one fel uncomfortable, the questioner is considered to violate that individual's sociality rights (Spencer-Oatey, 2005). Finally, rapport is influenced by interac. tional goal, or what a person expects as the outcome of an interaction. Interactional goals are further categorized into transactionl goals (obtaining information) and relational goals, meaning other goals regarding the speaker-hearer interpersonal relationship. Spencer-ate (2009) aed hat the faiure to met the gols may have native fets on rapport Rapport, then, isin theentr of three force (face, sociality rights and obligations, and interactional goals). The extent to which each force influences rapport varies depending on the contexts, the interactants, and their backgrounds, and past experiences.

There are four tendencies in rapport management (Spencer-Oatey, 2009, p. 117-118): (1) \*rapport enhancement" (intention to strengthen or reinforce the harmony between speakers and hearers); (2) \*rapport maintenance (intention to preserve the harmony between speakers and hearers; (3) rapport neglect (absence of attention towards the harmony between speakers and hearers) and (4) "rapport challenge" (intention to "challenge or impair' the harmony between speakers and hearers).

While language analysis has not been a focal point in Spencer-Oatey's research (2005), looking at how the micro-level interaction unfolds in real time is critical in understanding rapport. By analyzing frames and contextualization cues, Iillustrate how the ITA strengthened and maintained rapport with the student by atending to the student's face, rights, and interactional goals. I also demonstrate the usefulnessof frame analysis and contextualization cues in detecting and solving misunderstanding resulting from schema mismatch (Zhu, 2014).

# 1.2. Analytical framework

I employed frame analysis (Goffman, 1974) and contextualization cues (Gumperz, 1982) as tools to examine rapport management (Spencer-Oatey, 2005). This is because underlining all three bases of rapport are shared inferencing and shared schemas. IS provides access o interactants shared schemas and inferences through examining their verbal and non-verbal cues. Contextual information can also be brought into the talk through interviews. When linguisic analysis and context are combined, we bettr understand how participants' frames of their face, rights, and expected communicative goals align or misalign.

Goffman (1974, p. 10) defined frames as "definitions of asituation." A frame answers the question what is it that's going on here?" (p. 25).This means communication breakdowns can happen when interlocutors define a situation differently (Gordon, 2015). Identifying frames also relates to what Gumperz (1982, p. 131) calld \*contextualization cues' or \*any feature of linguistic form that contributes to the ignaling of contextual presuppositions. Contextualization cues can include verbal, non-verbal, and paralinguistic features (Gumperz, 1982), and they indicate the speaker's understanding of the situation at hand in terms of what i happening and what is being said (Schiffrin, 196). Therefore, (un)successfl interpretations of contextualization cues may affect the unfolding interaction (Gumperz, 1982). Put differently, contextualization cues and frames shed light on both \*contextual presuppositions ("assumed background knowledge") and \*situated inference" (Schifri, 1994, p. 100). Bothframing and contextualization cues are closely related to interlocutors schemas - knowledge and past experiences that inform our behaviors (Zhu, 2014); therefore, analyzing framing and contextualization cues enables researchers to connect what happens in the interaction with underlying schemas. Exploring the interaction alongside contextual information then offers more comprehensive insights into the assumptions conditioning the speakers' contribution in their conversation.

# 2. Methods to study rapport

Rapport has often been conceptualized as the harmonious relationship between the speaker and the hearer (Ho, 2011; Rudolph, 1994). Viewed this way, rapport can be managed through stylization (Lamb, 2015), humor (Nguyen, 2007; Petraki & Ramayanti, 2018) or by mitigating facethreatening acts (Li, 2016). However, Lauriks et al. (2015) argued that rapport's defintion must be broadened to encompas both harmonious and discordant relationships. The authors indicated that the participants maintained their discordant relationships purposefully and both rapport neglect and rapport maintenance/enhancement can be managed concurrently among shop owners, employee, and customers. In other words, rapport i neutral rather than indexing positive afect (Zhang, 2019)

Different rapport research methods have illuminated our understanding of this slippery concet but research on sociality rights and obligations as well as interactional goals remains sparse. Brown and Levinson's notion of face and its elaborated conceptualization (Spencer-Oate, 2008) are central to studying rapport and have predominated rapport research. For example, politeness and face were beneficial for Nguyen (2007) and Rudolph (1994) in investigating how a positive relationship between teacher and student(s) was established and maintained through linguistic devices for humor and collaboration. Notably, Weihua Zhu's study of English Corner participants (2014) provided compelling examples of how disagreeing with a speaker's negative self-evaluation was not considered impolite. Rather t reresented the hearer's consideration of the speaker's face and equity rights and therefore helped to maintain and strengthen rapport. Of course, this was possbly because the participants shared certain schemas having come from the same culture and having known each other long enough.

Another development in rapport research is the use Spencer-Oatey's (2005, 2008) RMT. Studies employing RMT have utilized interviews as the most common method to understand sociality rights. For example, Zhang (2019) interviewed both ITAs and American TAs about instructors and students obligations, rights, and valued traits. Zhang reported that ITAs shared American TAs schemas when it comes to rights and obligations (sociality rights in Spencer-Oatey's term) but American TAs mentioned several aspects which ITAs did not, including willingness to ask questions and reaching out for help when needed, students' rights to fail, and expecting care from teachers. Zhang (2013)also noted ITAs were aware of and able to use rapport management strategies (e.g, enhancement, maintenance, neglect, and challenge). However, their rapport management depended on their identities as they navigated the American culture alongside theirs.

Interactional data was also collected to examine the complexity of sociality rights and identity. Li (2016) audio-recorded the in. teractions among employees (domestic and foreign) and managers in two Hong Kong-based educational institutions. The analysis focused on Spencer-Oatey's (2000 face and sociality rights when power differences among participants exist, as in office hours. Li's findings indicated that the participants acknowledged each other's face and sociality rights by making indirect requests and avoiding imposition. However, Lauriks et al. (2015) also illsrated that power differences and discordant raort are sometimes maintained strategically.

Another adition to rapport methodology is the use f IS, where researchers analyzed rapport as emerging in the interactions. For example, Park (2016) discovered that a teacher's use of informal conversations, humor, compliments when corrcting students and showing empathy can enhance rapport in clas. Similarl, Lamb (2015) used discourse analysis and IS to explore how a haole (White) teacher used stylization to manage rapport with his multilingual students in Hawai'i. The article showed how IS can shed light on the linguistic and non-linguistic representation of facework and interactional goals (Spencer-Oatey, 2008) although Lamb's research did not employ follow-up interviews on interactional goals.

IS also has potential for exploring how invisible schemas can be displayed in the interactions. Moreover, ittle is known about how rapport is managed in ITA-intenational student interactions, especially when misunderstanding occurs. House (2003) proposed the discourse comprehension and production model for studying misunderstandings. She established that it is crucial to consider both linguistic and non-linguistic cues while looking for misunderstanding in both the situated interaction and the macro context House's advice points to the relevance of analyzing schemas, footings, and contextualization cues combined with rapport management (Spencer-Oatey, 2008). In her example of a German instructor (L) and American student (Amy), misunderstanding happened afer L and Amy's schemas clashed and both contextualization and linguistic cues failed to be interpreted.

Overall, previous work has examined aspects of rapport such as face sociality rights, and to a leser extent interactional goals. ITA research has revealed the mulifaceted nature of rapport and has guided us in seing communication as a two-way street instead of imposing a deficit lens on ITAs command of English. Previous studies seem to suggest that schemas might be invisible yet impactful at the interaction lel (e.g., House, 2003; Lauriks et al., 2015; Zhu, 2014). My research builds on these ideas and sees to expand our current understanding of the complexity of rapport in OHs through a multi-pronged aproach. I do this by collcting multiple sources of data and by exploring how an ITA managed rapport when his student semed to orient toward rapport neglec r rapport chllenge. . seek insights into misunderstanding and rapport management i ight of brought along and brought aout (Giddens, 1976). By looking at both the recorded conversational data and elciting participants' views of this meting, I demonstrate the dynamic of rapport management under the influence of the participants brought along expectations. While both participants possessed advanced English levels and linguisic forms did not afect rapport as in Chiang (2016), nor did the student demonstrae an Avoidance orientation ., avoiding confrontation or asking questions) as in Subtirelu (2017), miscommunication still arose. In what follows, I show: (1) how intercultural OHs can be a battl of schemas, 2) how rapport can be impaired as conflicting schemas collide at the brought about lel, and (3) how participants resolved these conflicts collectively.

# 3. This study

# 3.1. Participants

This study was done at a public universty in the US. It is a research university that ffers Bachelor, Masters and Doctorate degree programs and nearly 18,00 students were enrolled at the time of study. Participants in this research were in language studies programs. Aftr obtaining Intitutional Review Board approval, I ollected data over two semesters. The larger project included data from three ITAs from the Philippines (Phil, Vietnam (Hieu), and Canada (Agnes) respectively. Atotal of 6 meetings were recorded between the ITAs and five students. Students' exit surveys show that al instructors were sucesful in meeting students needs. However, when coding for rapport orientation, I noticed a distinct ifference in how overlapping talk happened in these consultations. In Phil and Agnes' meetings, overlapping talk is often teacher-initiated. Student-initiated overlapping talk was only for echoing the ITA or interjecting an explanation. There was only one instance where Agnes's student interrupted her o correct a piece f information. None of such student-initiated interrupting talk damaged rapport. In contrast Hieu's OH meeting with his student, Loreen, showed student rapport orientations that can be labeled as \*rapport neglect' or \*rapport challenge," which was not the case in Agnes or Phil's OH metings. There was also miscommunication in Hieu's meeting, making it compellig for further analysis. More importantl, the data from Hieu and Loreen reveal how conflicting schemas regarding the purposes of OHs and instructors' and students' responsibilities mpacted rpport at the brought about level. his paper unpees the proces leading t a lack of rapport when Hieu and Loreen brought along schemas and interactional goals and displayed them to one another.

Instructor. Hieu was 30-year-old male instructor originall from Vietnam, where he completed a Bachelor's in TEFL. He came to the US for a Master's degree and was in his third year of a doctoral program in applied linguistics at the time of research. Prior to his arrival in the US, Hieu had five years' teaching experience in a Vietnamese university.

Student. Loreen was in her 40s. She was originall from Germany and spoke fluent English. She moved to the US almost 10 years prior to the time of the study. Loreen was training to be a language teacher and had taken classes at a community college prior to joining her undergraduate program.

The Class Hieu taught an advanced undergraduate level classfocusing on language testing. The class met twice a week in person. He managed course design, course instruction, and grading like other professors in the department. For the final project in Hieu's cas, students either wrote a literature review or created a test. He encouraged them to meet with him during OHs before finalizing their projects, and this is the context for the data being analyzed here.

# 3.2. Data sources

Data consisted of (1) classrom observation field notes of Hieu's class; 2) a video recording of one OH meeting between Hieu and Loreen; (3) an exit survey completed by Loree, and (4) fllow-up interviews with both Hieu and Loren. I did member checking with Hieu to further validate my interpretations.

Clssroom observation. I observed a 75-min clas where I took field notes on Hieu's general teaching styles and his interactions witl students.

OH observation and recording. I video-recorded the $5 0 \mathrm { - m i n }$ meeting between Hieu and Loreen. During the meeting, I was allowed to observe in a corner of Hieu's ofice, which was shared with three other ITAs who were simultaneously working at their desks.

Exit survey. At the end of the meeting, I collected Loreen's background information and her evaluation of the meeting through an exit survey. It consisted of 10 questions, most of which required a short answer. One question asked about OH expectations and another asked if the meting was successful (an explanation was required f it was not successful). Loreen completed the survey in about 5 min.

Interviews. I watched the video multiple times before transcribing and coding. After preliminary coding, I wrote down my in. terpretations along with some interview questions and aranged semi-structured interviews with Hieu and Loreen.

The two interviews with Hieu lasted approximately $4 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ in total (one $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and the other $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ) and the single interview with

Loreen lasted 45 min. Each participant was interviewed separately on different days at locations convenient for them. The interviews with Hieu elicited information about his background, his experiences with OHs, his expectations for OHs, his decision making in the meeting with Loren, and his views of the consultation. The interview with Loreen focused on her previous OH experiences and her views of the OH meeting with Hieu. Allinterviews were automatically transcribed using Descript (https://www.descript.com) and Otter.ai and then manually edited for accuracy. Non-verbal cues were also manually annotated.

# 3.3. Data analysis

I watched the video-recorded OH meting several times and edited the software-generated transcript. First I conducted process coding (Saldana, 2013) in which I labeled each utterance with a verb (e.g., asking about break, giving advice, interrupting, complimenting) to yield an overview of the consultation. Next, I labeled face and sociality rights and obligations, and interactional goals in the data. Finally, I used descriptive coding (Saldana, 2013) to identify rapport orientation (maintenance, enhancement, neglect, challenge) in each chunk of question-answer sequence. The topic of each sequence served as an artificial boundary. Appendix A demonstrates my coding process.

Hieu's case was particularly interesting because there was significantly more rapport neglect or rapport challenge utterances used by the student compared to other OH meetings in my larger study. For example, in the ollowing excerpt (5 min into the meeting), Hieu commented that the test Loreen's group was designing was overly ambitious.

While Hieu was suggesting that the test Loreen's group designed was not focused enough (you're trying to measure everything in Lines 4-5), Loreen voiced disagreement ("But couldn't you do that?" and \*why wouldn't you do that?" i Lines 7) and deended her work (e.g., Lines 7-12). From an RMT perspective, directly disagreeing with the instructor without any hedging like this could be facethreatening and therefore could be interpreted as rapport challenge. This happened often in this H meting. I rewatching the video, I noted a segment where Loreen seemed impatient and raised her voice, fllowed by a sequence where she challenged the instructor's authority. In my field notes, I described the atmosphere as "tense" and noted how other ITAs sharing th office looked at each other with concern. I treated this as rapport impairment and isolated that specific segment for detailed analysis.

In my analysis, I combined my field notes and codes to interpret data. This helped me draft questions for fllow-up interviews with Hieu and Loren. Finally, I added information from the interviews to my sheet of coded data and extracted exchanges of rapport enhancement or maintenance o report. I also shared this paper with Hieu for member-checking. He did not ffer any corrections, but he offered an explanation for Fig. 1.

# 4. Findings

In this meting, Loreen brought her test to Hieu to ensure she was on track with the final proect (i., the test desin project). Inhis interviews, Hieu thought highly of Loreen and commented that she was a motivated student who worked really hard and had "insightful ontributions to clas discussions. This parallels what I noted in my observation. Ialso found evidence for Hieu's comment at the end of the consultation when Loreen asked about a statistical problem they would be discussing the week afer.

Although the consultation was considered sucesful, it should be noted that miscommunication happened and was resolved during the meeting. In follow-up interviews, Hieu confirmed this, and Loree explicitly mentioned her confusion when she could not figure out what Hieu required her to do.

At the beginning of the semester, Hieu uploaded project guidelines, which he expected students to follow when designing their test to their cass Leaning Management System. Heu intended to focus students attention on the tester's perspective, that i to be able to write tes items and supply reearch-based rationale for items used. He wanted students to submit the test items, the test specification, and item specifications. There was a mismatch in role schema (Nishida, 199; Zhu, 2014), or no shared knowledge of expectations, since Loreen was unawareof the guidelines, which might be why she mistook Hieu's suggestion to further develop the test as a request to re-design it. Loreen also did not send her work to Hieu before the meeting nor did Hieu ask about it However, the OH meeting was a successas confirmed by both Lorn (through a post-consultation survey) and Hieu (in a follow-up interview). Hieu mentioned that he felt, at the end of the meeting, Loreen understood how her test could be improved, and he could ee the improvement in ther fnal test submission. Throughout the consultation, Hieu used different stratgies to establish rapport, trting with smalltalk. As the consul. tation unfolded, Loren oriented to rapport nlect and raport challenge as she wanted Hie totell her what todo. Hieu gave her the floor, treating her interruption as learning, asking scafolding questions, and giving extended explanations when he deemed it necessary to meet Lrn's socialit rights and interactional goals.  briefl dicuss Hieu's rapport management strategies (smal tlk complimenting and reassuring, asking scafflding questions, and giving flor) before focusing on segments where schema clash became visible in the form of misunderstanding..

# 4.1. Small talk

In Excerpt 2(see Appendix B), the consultation started cordiall with Hieu and Loreen engaging in a phatic communication event. As their meeting occurred ater their spring break, they started witha small talk on this topi. Hieu's engagement in small tlk is his first rapport enhancement strategy since House (2003) demonstrated how ignoring a student's small tlk frames can be sen as unfriendly and might affect the meeting negatively.

Fig. 1. Hieu scratched his forehead.

To begin, Hieu set a welcoming tone for his OH by engaging Loreen in a smal talk frame in Line 1. In this excerpt, the equal turns overlapping turns, positive verbal and non-verbal cues, and sharing personal information created a welcoming pre-consultation atmosphere. This small alk frame attends to the student's association rights, contributes to enhancing rapport, and shows their alignment of procedure schemas (Nishida, 199; Zhu, 2014). Hieu then marked the end of the smal talk by changing the topic: "So you and Hannah, right?" Hieu's question also servedas a ontextualization cue, signaling that they would now discus the \*main business"

# 4.2. Complimenting and reassuring

Excerpt 3occurred after Hieu and Loreen talked about their spring reces. Loreen was presenting her group's work when Hieu offered his compliments.

In this presentation frame, evident in Loren's long turns and Hieu's brief "uh huh'" or "okay' as cues for her to continue, Loreen explained how her group selected the reading text. Heu took up the listener role and at the same time positioned himself as the teacher through compliments (Lines 1 and 11). He also elaborated on how pleased he was with their control of the text difficulty (i.e. checking for word frequency and the text readability) inLines 20-23. His positive fedback (saying "good" and "very good") and non-verbal cue (nodding) showed he valued Loreen's work. Moreover, in Lines 27-33, Loreen finished the presentation and made clear that she wanted to know if it was correct or "completely wrong", to which Hieu made a face-saving move to reassure her by saying \*it's not completely wrong! Through enhancing the hearers fce and being attentive to Loreen's social rights (showing that he was listening by his gaze on her computer screen), he attempted to build positive rapport.

However, Hieu's verbal cues seemed not t register with Loreen as she paid more attention to his non-verbal cues, interpreting them as negative feedback. In the interview, Loreen suggested that she saw Hieu's non-verbal cues in Lines 8-9, which she described as having his palm on his face (rewatching the video showed that he was scratching his forehead, which Hieu commented in the member checking as let me think how I can help you with this. ee Fig. 1.), as a sign of disapproval. This is possbly the reason Loreen did not recall being complimented throughout the meeting. Hieu's body language, in this case, worked against his intention and was interpreted as rapport challenge.

# 4.3. Asking scaffolding questions

Throughout the meeting, Hieu promoted Loreen's learning through two scaffolding techniques: asking questions and giving explicit suggestions. In interviews, Hieu said he preferred a more indirect approach to teaching. It was his teaching philosophy that he could only provide \*stimulit and \*conditions' for his students to learn on thir own. Because of this, he only used explicit teaching when students seemed confused or "can't understand." This informed his decisions to use guiding questions in the following excerpt. Following Excerpt 3, when Hieu reassured Loreen that she was on the right track, he also told her to start with the question" and be clear about the purpose of the test According to Hieu, the literature did not support using one cloze test to measure multiple anguage components and skill. He also wanted Loreento clarify which part of grammar/vocabulary/comprehension skills were being tested. To draw Loreen's attention to this ssue, Hieu used four guiding questions in Lines 1-2, 4, 23-24 and 27 of Excerpt 4.

This excerpt marks the collision between the two interlocutors views of each other's sociality rights and interactional goals. While Hieu's guiding questions (Lines 1, 2, 23, 24, 27, 45 and 46) reflected his belief that students are independent, autonomous thinkers, and that his obligation is to guide them to figure out knowledge, healso realized that his questions did not elicit the intended answers as the student started to "defend her test. He continued the instructional frame but also decided to be more explicit starting in Lines 35 through 39 where he suggested Loren find literature to support her claim and clearly state the specific grammar component(s) to be measured because "grammar is huge' (Lines 41-49). Again, Hieu's attention to Loreen's rights, at least as Hieu saw them (to be in. dependent and to learn), was viewed by Loreen as "[making] me struggle through this whole thing," in our interview. In other words, misunderstanding happened because of a clash in role schema where Loreen expected Hieu to tel her what t do while Hieu saw his role quite differently (i.e., teacher as guide).

Loreen later admitted in the interview that she became really \*confrontational' ecause she thought he did not value her work and that she needed to create another test despite already putting six or $^ { 7 \mathrm { h } }$ of work into the test. This reflects a mismatch between Loreen's interactional goal of wanting \*him just to tell me what to do" and Hieu's framing the interaction as a teachable moment. In other words, their H schemas (i. petions of what Hs are for) differed and reultd in how H framed his response as we se n the Excerpt. This ilustrates how OHs can be a site for intercultural challenges and a battl of conflicting schemas, even in the face of rapport maintenance and enhancement.

# 4.4. Giving the floor

While Loren's interruption can be considered face-threatening (Brown & Levinson, 1987) or infringing on Hieu'sequity rights and his interactional goals (to finish his instruction and to give the student feedack), Hieu shared in the interview that he treated it as necessary for Loren's learning. His decision to yield the floor (see Excerpt 5 in Appendix B) came from his consideration for her interactional goals, specifically her transactional goals (geting the information), and therefore, contributed to rapport maintenance.

# 4.5. Dealing with rapport challenge

As their conversation continued, the miscommunication seemed unresolved, and it affected their rapport.

There are several cues of rapport being challenged in Excerpt 6. First, Loreen's non-verbal cues in Line 5 (narrowed eyes, not looking at Hieu when he was speaking, then an explicit statement  don't understand" in Line 9 and her long pauses i Line 10 and Line 13) signaled to Hieu that her interactional goals were not being met. Faced with Loreen's direct request (Lines 14-17) and having heard her "defend' her test, Hieu realized it might be better if he read what Loreen had prepared in whole, which was why he responded as he did in Lines 19-20.

When Loreen continued explaining, Hieu employed various strategies to address her concern along with the rapport challenge. explicitly stating requirements, giving extended explanations, giving examples, and showing empathy.

In Excerpt 7, Loreen stated she had not included item specifications in her test. Hieu had been trying to guide her to add the test specification, claifying the urpose, and the item specification, yet Loreen semed confused, so he decided to tellher directly that it was an important course outcome (Lines 5-6).

Next, Hieu elaborated his point in Excerpt 8, emphasizing that considering testing from a tester's perspective requires "stepping away from being a teacher' and being able to "show evidence' that the test is good (Lines 8 and 16).

In this explanation frame, Hieu both reinforced his point (Lines 4-5 and Lines 7-8) and showed empathy (Lines 1-16) by calling the projec \*challenging and drawing attention tothe different role Loreen might be projecting onto the projec of teacher compared to tester. He shared in his interview that when he took this course as a graduate student, it was difficult for him to shift from the teacher's to the tester's perspective. While his direct request can be treated as imposing on Loreen's autonomy (sociality rights), his extended explanation (Lines 11 through 16) and verbal cue (I understand") helped to lessen the request's negative effect. After this excerpt, Hieu also told Loreen that item specifications were key because without it \*you do not have the common language to talk about things."

Another measure he took was to give examples to clear Loreen's confusion. Loreen commented that once Hieu showed her the frst example by revisting one of the class readings and saying "So it is grammar. So you need to know, specify whether it is nominals or gerund or conditional," she started to understand. As their exchange progresse in Excerpt 9, Loreen recapped what she needed to do and Hieu confirmed that was correct. In the end, shared positive rapport resumed with both participants showing positive non-verbal cues (Line 1 and Line 2) in the forms of overlapping turns (Line 7 and Line 10), verbal cues of agreement (Lines 8, 10 and 12) and excitement ("superb").

In short, Hieu's multiple strategies attended to Loreen's face, equity rights, and most importantly, interactional goals. The misunderstanding was resolved once Loreen's transactional goal of getting Hieu to tel her what to do was satisfied. Describing the success of the meeting, Loreen said: \*In the end, it helped me because I really- I walked out with a clear understanding of how he wanted me to improve the project' (Interview, 2019).

# 5. Discussion

This study analyzed data from an OH meeting, an observation log, a survey and threefollow up interviews with Hieu and Loreen. The findings revealed that rapport in an OH meeting can be enhanced, maintained, and challenged in multiple ways, even when both participants show collaboratie effrts. showed that Heu employed various strategie to manage rapport with Loreen, namely using smal talk, complimening, scaffolding by questions, xamples, anddirec rquest. Thee straties sinif his intention to treat oreen fairly as an independent academic and, at the same time, demonstrate apreciation towards her hard work Such strategies also showed his consideration of Loreen's face, rights, and interactional goals while attempting to maintain and enhance rapport with her. This aligns with previous findings on rapport building strategies by Adel (2011), Nguyen (2007), Park (2016), and Zhang (2013, 2019). More importantly, my findings confirmed Zhang's (2019) conclusion that ITAs often posses the understanding of the norms in OH and rapport management. However, Hieu interestingly demonstrated similaritie to both the ITAs and American TAs in Zhang's research. Similar to both groups of TAs, Hieu believed he should push students critical thinking and he could decide the best approach to teach his students. Hieu also oriented toward presenting scholarly challenges to his student in this meeting, a teacher's role reported by American TAs in Zhang (2019). This helps us further question the reductionist view of culture as national culture, a point shall retun to later. In the articl, I also showed that when miscommunication occurred because f conflicting schemas regarding teacher/student rights and responsibilities, Hieu was ableto shift t adifferent frame (i.e., shftin from teaching to telling) to maintain rapport.

Nevertheless this study further illustrated the need to treat culture as a meaning making proces and provide \*thick description of cultures instead of presuming cultural differences because of the interlocutor's ethnicity or places of origin (e.g, Hieu was from Vietnam and Loreen from Germany). hu Hua et al.(2020) defines culture as "a value system that evolves in a specific community that encourages secific kinds of sense- and meaning-making practices with specific semiotic resources' (p.53). A person can be members of different national, rofessional and organizational cultures and each of these cultures inluences the others (Zhu, 2019). Intercultural communication should then be understood as how individuals, in order to achieve their communication goals, negotiate cultural or linguistic ifferences which may be percived relevant by at least one party in the interaction (H. Zhu, 2019, p. 210). Hieu is aeacher, an academic, and a graduate student while Loreen was quite new in her membership in the academic community. Her previous experience as astudent in a community college does not align with Hieu's experience as a universty (graduate) student. As a result, their communication is inevitably intercultural on the small c' level of culture - i.e., institutional cultures. Thus, the paper also pointed to the thorny nature of intercultural OH meetings, where communication breakdown occurred because of schema mismatch, leading to rapport damage at the brought about level. It was not due to the lack of language proficiency as Chiang (2009) found. Rather, my analysis revealed that the collision of the speaker's and hearer's diffring schemas (e.g., expectations and views of one another's obligations) caused misunderstanding and even frustration on the student's part. Hieu said when he first went to OHs as a student, he emailed his professors outlining what he would like to discuss therey setting the agenda and taking a student-initiated approach. Thus, Hieu expected his students to similarly take initiative. Loreen, however, was inroduced to OHs and its norms at a community college where her teachers asked her what she wanted to talk about before they met. The pair's dissimilar experiences and expectations of each other's roles and obligations led to misunderstanding when Hieu sugested that Loreen supplement more materials and restructure the test, which Loreen interpreted as disapproval, resulting in her confrontational responses.

Next, non-verbal cues were significant in how messages were interpreted. Perceived negative non-verbal cues sometimes subverted positive verbal cues. This was evident when Hieu complimented Loreen, but she interpreted his forehead-scratching gesture as a disapproval sign. This led to Loreen's assertion that \*he doesn't even acknowledge we already put a lot of thoughts into this."

Most importantly, my analysis showed that Loreens's transactional goal of wanting the teacher to tel her what to do was the key factor in rapport management (Spencer-Oatey, 2009), more so than face. Loreen's qualit face (wanting the teacher to acknowledge her hard work) was important to her as well. However, Hieu's teaching phlosophy and expectations also affcted the ways that ther interaction unfolded, similar to what Zhang (2013) suggested about ITAs identity. Misunderstanding happened when these values and schemas collided and the clash in brought along knowledge was only resolved when Loreen's transactional wants were fulilled.

# 6. Conclusion

Applying an IS perspective to an OH, I demonstrated how rapport management is impacted by multiple fores, including interlocutors perception of each other's face, rights, and interactional goals, which are shaped by their schemas and expectations (the brought along). The interaction among these forces partly surfaces in the unfolding conversation (the brought about) and sometimes causes communication problems. My findings suggested that a multi-pronged approach is useful in examining OH intercultural communication and that interactional goals play an important role in the success of OH consultations. When the student and the teacher framed their goals differently, problems arose. For this reason, i i mportant that ITAs and students share their expectations before the consultation, and that these are made explicit to avoid expectation and interactional goals mismatch.

Future IS studies can consider different ways intercultural misunderstandings manifest in OHs. Further research into the in. teractions betwee culture and three bases of rapport would benefit our understanding of academic encounters. Interested scholars can also use the approach proposed in this article to investigate OHs where the instructors and students ae from different disciplines and more efforts might be needed to navigate schema mismatches.

4 H:. No, it's.((shakes head)) we need evidence for that and you need kind of sound evidence for that L: yeah, but can't the answer itself be the evidence for   
6 it?   
7 H: No. Because you know, it's too many things at the
