# ABSTRACT

With the advancement of educational technologies, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) tools, like online dictionaries, are essential for acquiring a second language, especially new vocabulary. There has been no empirical focus on the usage of Ġabra online dictionary in learning Maltese, with a specific focus on international adults learning Maltese as a second language (ML2) and a lack of research in the pedagogy of e-dictionaries. This study aims to contribute to this research gap by exploring teachers’ perspectives and pedagogy of Ġabra for adults learning ML2, which could refer to any other second language. Unstructured interviews were conducted to obtain qualitative data from eleven teachers of ML2 adult learners including refugee learners. According to the study’s findings, Ġabra helps students learn new words, it is simple to use, it is a great resource and reference for ML2 learning, and it is convenient. The research also offers various pedagogical activities that illustrate how Ġabra is implemented in class. Another significant characteristic of Ġabra identified in this study is that students do not need to know the basic verb/noun/adjective to seek for a word, as they would in a traditional dictionary. Ġabra’s shortcomings were its incompleteness, no pronunciation feature, lack of sentence examples and its dependency on internet access. Although Ġabra’s benefits exceeded its disadvantages, it was recommended that Ġabra should continue to be corrected and to use artificial intelligence applications.

# Introduction

With the proliferation of educational technologies, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has developed into an active interdisciplinary subject with significant research opportunities and topic variety (Chen et  al., 2021), like the use of online dictionaries in second language acquisition (SLA) (Zhang & Zou, 2020; 2021; Gánem-Gutiérrez & Gilmore, 2021; Andujar, 2020). Online dictionaries are becoming popular in most second language (L2) teaching and learning contexts. However, there is a lack of scholarly literature about the pedagogy of e-dictionaries and the usage of the online Maltese-English-Maltesedictionary, Ġabra.

Ġabra is a public, most popular and accessible e-dictionary for Maltese that was created by combining many lexical resources into a single shared database (Camilleri, 2013). While Ġabra is not an entire Maltese dictionary, currently it contains 19,470 words and 4,514,679 inflective word forms. These entries are primarily root-linked, include English translations, and are distinguished by various morphological features. The words, their forms and their meanings were obtained from several sources, including the traditional printed dictionaries of Ġużè Aquilina and Erin Serracino-Inglott (Camilleri, 2013).

# Statement of the problem

While several L2 teachers have recognised an online lexicon’s crucial contribution in SLA, Wisskirchen et  al. (2017) contend that an online dictionary has some shortcomings that have not been effectively addressed to enhance its full utilization by both teachers and students. Given the crucial roles that online dictionaries play in enabling second language acquisition (SLA), it is expected that teachers and students adopt it in their teaching and learning endeavours. However, Williamson (2020) noted that the use of online dictionaries is limited among L2 teachers, and this was also confirmed in this study.

Despite the abundance of scholarly research conducted to investigate students’ and teachers’ attitudes toward e-dictionaries, there has been a lack of research to investigate the teaching methods of using e-dictionaries in the adult language classroom. Consequently, this study was carried out to contribute to this research problems, besides identifying Ġabra’s benefits and drawbacks.

Camilleri (2013) did not want the Maltese language that is currently only spoken in Malta by almost half a million people to be lost in the digital world, and thus created the Ġabra online dictionary. The Ġabra system was entirely abandoned, and just a small part of it was updated, after September 2015 when the Maltese Language National Council and the University of Malta decided to invest in it (Scicluna, 2019). Low utilization may have contributed to this lack of willingness.

# Scope of the present study

This study aims to bridge the above research problem and provide information that will be important to the developers, educators and users of Ġabra and any other online lexicon. Software vendors who are responsible for developing an e-dictionary could use the findings from this study to identify areas of improvement which are necessary to ensure that teachers and students use an e-dictionary. Moreover, L2 educators, future researchers and academics could benefit by implementing the pedagogies of online dictionaries, based on the study findings.

# Literature review

# Using Online Dictionaries

Dictionaries have always been valuable tools for language learners to learn new words and overcome L2 difficulties (Fithriani, 2021). Clearly, dictionaries are the most easily available, widely used, and affordable learning materials (Chan, 2014).

Online dictionaries provide numerous benefits for L2 students, including ease of use, speed, small size, boost the students’ vocabulary, increase student autonomy through the ability to conduct quick searches, enhance the input offered to students, acknowledge different learning styles and approaches, and complete reading activities more rapidly than those using print dictionaries (Dashtestani, 2013). According to Barham (2017), students mostly employ an online dictionary for pronunciation, spelling, writing, and especially for determining the meaning of new words. However, students sometimes struggle to find the correct meaning out of the many entries that online dictionaries present (Barham, 2017).

Scholars elucidate that using an online dictionary can provide the necessary audio pronunciation of L2 words (Casañ-Núñez, 2021; Yang et  al., 2019). Pronunciation is a crucial element in SLA because it enhances the quality of communication among the parties exchanging information. This is more advantageous than a traditional dictionary whereby a learner must read the phonemic symbols that represents pronunciations (Yang et  al., 2019). Learners benefit from such pronunciations since they gain L2 proficiency when practising efficiently by uttering L2 words effectively (Peng et  al., 2021; Brudermann et  al., 2021). The conventional dictionary cannot provide such an advantage. Therefore, the online dictionary has great potential for taking the place of the traditional dictionary. Although there is a plethora of research on the benefits and drawbacks of online dictionaries (e.g. Peng et  al., 2021; Brudermann et  al., 2021; Casañ-Núñez, 2021; Yang et  al., 2019), there is a lack of studies on pedagogical approaches for using online dictionaries in class, which is what this study attempts to address.

# Pedagogical strategies to use online dictionaries in class

Educational institutions can incorporate online learning in the expansion and diversification of learners’ opportunities (Nami, 2021; Bonet, 2021). Several reasons have been given for its students’ support. Researchers have demonstrated that in a classroom setting with approximately 25 students, it is practically difficult for teachers to find an effective strategy for all students (Milla & Gutierrez-Mangado, 2019). This is because the teacher cannot easily focus on each learner’s needs. However, with the help of online tools, including an e-dictionary, each student’s needs can easily be identified since learners are using real-time communicative tools (Debattista, 2019).

Jin and Deifell (2013) state that by facilitating in-class or online conversations of situations in which online translators produce erroneous and sometimes hilarious translations, L2 educators may stimulate learners’ critical thinking and evaluate their progress of awareness and metalinguistic knowledge. Advanced-level students could be requested to retranslate Google Translate–generated translations using online dictionaries, which can help them build a deeper knowledge of each word’s contextual meaning and use (Jin & Deifell, 2013). The major purpose of the current study was to conduct further research on the pedagogy of using e-dictionaries especially Ġabra in the classroom, because there is a paucity of academic research on the use of online dictionaries in the classroom.

# How to use the online dictionary, Ġabra to search for words

As an e-dictionary of Maltese-English-Maltese, the technological system of Ġabra meaning ‘Collection’, which can be accessed on the following site: https://mlrs.research.um.edu.mt/resources/gabra/ was created in 2013 as part of a Master’s thesis by John J. Camilleri.

Besides other sources, Camilleri (2013) also employed Schembri’s (2006) study to develop a rule-based system. A rule-based system uses predefined rules to collect, analyse, and modify information (Orozov & Orozov, 2021). Rule-based systems require a collection of facts or a source of data, and a set of rules for manipulating that data, to function. These rules are commonly referred to as ‘If statements,’ because they usually run something like this: ‘IF X happens, THEN do Y.’ (Orozov & Orozov, 2021). Camilleri (2013) programmed the morphological rules in a grammatical framework, resulting in a system that automatically creates verb derivations and inflections based on the Maltese verb root provided by the user.

Like many Native American languages, Arabic, Asian languages such as Japanese, and some languages in Africa and Australia, Maltese lacks the infinitive verb as its basic verb and, relies on roots. For example, suppose the Ġabra platform architect provided the root ‘f-t-ħ’, which is the three-consonant root of the basic verb ‘fetaħ,’ meaning ‘he opened,’ since in Maltese, the Mamma which is the third person singular masculine in the perfective aspect is the basic verb rather than the infinitive. A perfective aspect describes a temporally-bounded event and it indicates a completed action (for example: Paul ate pasta) (Comrie & Borg, 1985). From the provided root ‘f-t-ħ’, the system then creates the various derivative and inflective verb forms of ‘f-t-ħ’, such as in the perfective (e.g. ‘ftaħt’ [I opened]; ‘fetħet’ [she opened]), imperative singular (e.g. ‘iftaħ!’ [open!]) , imperative plural (e.g. ‘iftħu!’ [open!]), imperative negative plural (e.g. ‘tiftħux!’ [do not open!]), etc. However, since it is a rule-based system, there are instances of spelling mistakes, often due to over-generalization in which the words created by the system followed another verb/dataset inflection or derivation and created non-existent or semantically meaningless words (Turner, 2019). Some educators and Faculty of Education students are checking and correcting the words that are created by the Ġabra rule-based system (e.g., Scicluna, 2019).

Camilleri (2013) discusses that users might browse for a verb from Ġabra by clicking on ‘Root Search’ at the top of the web page and composing its root or derivative form, as shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows another approach for extracting a word from Ġabra by typing the basic verb itself which reveals more information about the verb, including all its forms in the system and its meaning/s in English.

Table 3 displays an example of an Excel spreadsheet for each tense and aspect of the verb ‘qasam’ (which like ‘kiser’, also means ‘to break’) before Scicluna (2019) corrected it. As indicated in Table 3, various inaccuracies can be identified since Ġabra is a computerised system and hence verb and noun families are constructed digitally (i.e. they are developed independently by the rule-based system). Table 4 shows a snapshot of the revised verb ‘qasam’ (to break).

# Ġabra limitations

In the case of verbs, one of the most common errors found by Scicluna (2019) was when a verb merged with the direct object pronoun, as shown in Table 5. The system always retains the original form of how a verb conjugates itself, both in the positive and in the negative form, for example, ‘huma sajru’ (they cooked) or ‘jien ma nħallatx’ (I do not mix). Furthermore, the system retains the suffixes of the direct and indirect objects, and therefore, conjugated verbs are automatically joined to the suffixes of the direct and the indirect objects and might end in a word that does not exist (Dilenschneider, 2017). Some examples are sajruek\*1 instead of sajruk (they cooked you) (as shown in Table 5), ma nħallatekx\* instead of ma nħalltekx (I do not mix you), inneħħiek\* instead of inneħħik (I remove you) and nsajjarilha\* instead of nsajrilha (I cook for her). There were also several verbs that for this reason ended in double vowels, such as tpoġġiilna\* instead of tpoġġilna (you put for us), nneħħiilkom\* instead of nneħħilkom (I remove from you plural) and nserviilha\* instead of inservilha (I serve her).

Table 5. A sample from the Excel spreadsheet showing the verb conjugation of ‘sajjar’ (to cook) in the positive perfective where the verbs are mismatched with the direct object pronoun (Scicluna, 2019, p. 64).

Another mistake generated by the Ġabra system that Scicluna (2019) and Debattista (2019) found, was when the system merged the conjugated verbs in the second person singular and plural with the inflectional suffixes of the direct/indirect object of the second person singular and plural of other verbs, which are -ek, -kom, -lek and -lkom respectively (see Table 6). The system does not process that they are not morphologically correct and that they are not even used in daily speech (Buendgens-Kosten, 2020). Thus, the system creates words that semantically do not make any sense, for example, tfajtek (you threw yourself)

and tfajtuek\* (you throw yourselves). Scicluna (2019) and Debattista (2019) had to eliminate these words (see Table 7), because the system did not realise that although for instance, the verb construction tfajtek is grammatically correct, semantically and pragmatically ‘you threw yourself ’ does not make any sense. This is similar to Chomsky’s (1957) classic example “Colourless green ideas sleep furiously” which is a perfectly grammatical sentence that is totally meaningless. This kind of error appears for many Ġabra verb files that teachers and students are working on.

Besides verbs, Scicluna (2019) also found non-existent nouns in the text files she worked on. Examples of such nouns are ‘kappari\*’, ‘patati\*’ and ‘tiġieġiet\*’ instead of kappar (capers), ‘patata’ (potatoes) and ‘tiġieġ’ (hens), respectively (see Table 8). Scicluna (2019) eliminated these nouns and arranged the text files with the correct nouns according to their morphological forms, as shown in Table 9.

The general observation from the reviewed literature is that studies have been carried out around the concept of an online dictionary. However, there are limited studies that have adopted qualitative approaches towards understanding teachers’ opinions regarding using an online dictionary to teach L2.

# Research questions

This study seeks to explore teachers’ opinions and teaching methods on using Ġabra to teach ML2 adult learners. To achieve this objective, two research questions are posed, namely:

1. What is the significance of using Ġabra online dictionary to teach Maltese to international adults?   
2. Which pedagogical activities could encourage the use of Ġabra in the classroom?

# Methodology

# Research design

The study adopted a qualitative research technique, which Thanem and Knights (2019) characterise as enabling the researcher to investigate the realities of the phenomena under investigation based on the respondents’ perspectives. The qualitative study technique through unstructured interviews enabled the researcher to gain a thorough knowledge of the teachers’ views, feelings and practices of Ġabra to improve adults’ ML2 learning.

# Population and sampling

The study population consisted of a sample of eleven teachers. A purposeful sampling technique was used to select the participants because the researcher intended to collect specific information from individuals who had a direct experience with and extensive knowledge of the phenomenon being studied (Robinson, 2014), that is, using Ġabra when teaching ML2 to international adult learners. Since Ġabra is a current pedagogical tool, and ML2 is a new subject, recruiting teachers who teach adult international students and use Ġabra online dictionary was challenging, which explains why there were only eleven participants in this study.

The following table gives some background information about these eleven teachers:

Table 10 shows that the majority of the teachers in this study were female $( 7 2 . 8 \% )$ , are in their $2 0 s$ and $3 0 s$ $( 6 3 . 7 \% )$ , and have the least amount of teaching experience (1–10 years).All of them have 1–10 refugee students in class.

# Data collection and analysis

After obtaining ethical authorization from the University of Malta’s Faculty Research Ethics Committee, the researcher selected eleven teachers that she knew. Each teacher was contacted via an email to provide the date and time when they would be available for interviews. They were also asked to state whether they preferred phone, online or face-toface interviews. The participants who preferred face-to-face interviews were asked to provide the date, time and venues that they considered convenient to participate in the study. On the interview days, the researcher met each interviewee, disclosed all the material facts of the study and required them to sign an informed consent form. Each interview took approximately 30 minutes and all face-to-face, online via Zoom and telephone interviews were conducted within 5 days; one to three interviews per day. Each interviewee talked about the benefits and challenges of using Ġabra in teaching ML2 adult learners. The researcher sought permission from each participant to audio-record the interviews.

Data collected were transcribed verbatim to a Microsoft Word file. After transcription, datasets were entered into N-Vivo, which is a software that facilitates analysis of qualitative data (Swygart-Hobaugh, 2019). The software commands were used to generate codes, which were further combined to generate seven themes. The themes were subjected to analysis using the thematic analysis technique. The seven themes which were generated by NVivo were: words, pronunciation, dictionary, writing, language, app and internet. The following Table 11 shows the codes generated by the themes:

# Ethical considerations

Prior to engaging each participant in the study, the researcher disclosed all the material facts to the interviewees including the risks and benefits of participating in the study and the eventual use of the findings. Each participant was required to sign the informed consent form. Participants’ details were kept anonymous and confidential. Data collected were saved in electronic files safeguarded with strong passwords to maintain privacy.

Table 11. The codes generated by the theme.

# The study’s reliability and validity

Although the study included the participants’ narratives, its reliability relates to the consistency of replies to different codes of data themes. Member checking was conducted with the participants to enhance the findings’ validity by providing the interview transcripts to them and requesting them to make any required comments or corrections (Carlson, 2010).

Negative case analysis is the process of evaluating data acquired from every participant, that does not match the trends arising from the overall data (Carlson, 2010). The researcher employed the Day One Journal app to back up the entries in the cloud, and also view the journal, add new entries including the negative cases by using ‘tags,’ and input notes and reflections. The researcher thoroughly investigated the negative cases, since the approach of negative case analysis, paired with member checking, is an effective means of minimising researcher bias and thus the study’s validity (Carlson, 2010).

# The interview questions

The interview guidelines consisted of the following four unstructured questions exploring the research main themes:

1. How do you use an online dictionary in class?   
2. Do your students prefer to use an online dictionary rather than a traditional dictionary?   
3. What are the benefits of using an online dictionary when teaching Maltese as a second language?

4. What are the challenges of using an online dictionary in your Maltese class?

# Findings and discussion

This section presents an analysis and discussion of the data collected from the interviews with the eleven teachers. The dataset was used to generate themes that were discussed with reference to the literature in the following sections.

# Using online dictionaries to learn new words

All eleven participants agreed that Ġabra provides a wide range of vocabulary that adult learners may acquire. An interviewee confirmed Zhang (2013) who states that dictionaries are important in SLA because they provide relevant vocabulary which is a primary feature of communication and essential in mastering an L2.

It allows people to instantly discover the meaning, which is incredibly beneficial when they are in a rush. It can assist them in learning the Maltese language and meaning in a fascinating way by the click of a button. (Teacher E)

Eight participants suggested that adult students might employ online dictionaries in class and also for private study.

A number of activities, including the usage of online dictionaries, were noted by the participants. Five educators, as reported by teacher E, stated that they frequently observe their independent students take out their mobile phones/tablets and look for the definition of certain unfamiliar words on Ġabra, for example while reading a text that the teacher assigns them for classwork.

I frequently observe that I give an assignment to my students. It could be a poem, fiction or non-fiction, a magazine or a journal article, a recipe, etc., and when some students come across an unfamiliar word, some of them tend to grasp its meaning through pictures and context, whereas others who are more independent tend to use their mobile or tablet and look up the words on Ġabra. Some even tell you how close they were to the correct definition. (Teacher E)

Online dictionaries are highly recommended, but the problem of gaps in their database has continued to raise concerns regarding their completeness (Vancell, 2019). All respondents in the present study argued that some Maltese words especially those deriving from Italian and English are lacking in Ġabra.

Many loan words originating from Italian, Sicilian and English are absent from the online Ġabra dictionary. (Teacher A)

Occasionally my students search for a word in Ġabra and unfortunately, they do not find it. For example they searched for the following words which I listed:

‘ipprefera’ (to prefer, ‘irriforma’ (to reform), ‘immaġina’ (to imagine), ‘iddeverta’ (to enjoy), ‘iġġogja’ (to jog), ‘ikkonvin·a’ (to convince), ‘irre·ta’ (to act), ‘irrilassa’ (to relax), ‘iddribilja’ (to dribble), ‘iffawlja’ (to foul), ‘ipprintja’ (to print), ‘ittajpja’ (to type), and ‘ixxuttja’ (to shoot)). I was really surprised when my students could not find the adjective ‘iddejjaq’ (to get annoyed) because as you know, it is derived from Arabic. Then they have to find many of these words in their hardbound heavy dictionary at home. (Teacher G)

Such incompleteness means that the user is not going to find the meanings of certain words. Missing words reduces the effectiveness of Ġabra in enhancing ML2 acquisition when compared to traditional dictionaries. Additionally, a respondent reported that her students found inadequate information.

When using an online dictionary, my students sometimes discovered partial definitions and inadequate information. For instance, ‘applika’ (to apply). If you search for this word on Ġabra, you will find nouns and adjectives deriving from this word but not the verb ‘applika’ and its conjugations and inflections. The same goes for ‘ipprattika’ (to practise), ‘ipparkja’ (to park), ippjana (to plan), ‘jisem’ (to be called/named) and skanta (to stare). (Teacher J)

Similar to missing words, partial definitions and inadequate information undermines the strength of an online dictionary in enabling SLA (Vancell, 2018).

# Using e-dictionaries for writing tasks

During creative writing tasks, seven teachers verified Teachers G, J, and K’s observations of students searching up words, particularly for spelling, comprehension, and improvement in creative writing.

I often assign a writing task as a group work, and I’ve noticed that many students use their Ġabra mobile app to verify how certain words are spelled. (Teacher G)

During a creative writing group activity, I regularly notice my students searching up words on Ġabra that their classmates have came up to understand the meaning of the words they’re trying to spell. I understand how vital it is for them to improve their comprehension so that they can use these words in their own writing and speaking. (Teacher J)

I have noticed that some students use the Ġabra app to seek for synonyms for specific words so that they do not use the same words twice in their essay. It is beneficial for them to create their own ‘word bank’ by writing down frequent words and noting more strong alternatives when they encounter them. They may then apply these words to enhance their writing in the future. (Teacher K)

# Using e-dictionaries to play language game apps

Seven educators indicated that their students use the Ġabra online dictionary while taking quizzes or playing various language games such as ‘Scavenger Hunt,’ in which students compete against each other and against time, as reported by Teachers A, D, and H.

As you may know, games like Articulate, Scrabble, Hangman and Boggle are excellent for introducing new vocabulary, and while it is technically against the rules, I frequently see students consulting their Ġabra online dictionary to search up definitions and check spellings. I let them cheat in this way because I know it will help them add new Maltese words to their vocabulary. (Teacher A)

Adults enjoy language games such as ‘Scavenger Hunt,’ so don’t ignore them! I like to play such games with my students by asking them a series of perfectly timed questions that they must answer using their Ġabra mobile or tablet app, such as when I ask them, "How do you spell ‘żgħażagħ’ (youths)?"or "From which language does the term ‘speranza’ (hope) originate?" or "Tell me what ‘xogħol’ (job) means," etc. (Teacher D)

Despite the fact that my students are adults, I know they like participating in games that help them develop their Maltese vocabulary. So, every now and again, I come up with a rarely used word, such as ‘fatra’ (breakfast), and see who can tell me its meaning first. I usually see them seeking for such a word on their $\dot { \mathrm { ~ G ~ } }$ (br app. Sometimes I choose three words and challenge everyone to come up with the dumbest or funniest sentence that includes all three words while still making sense. They also like it when I choose a letter, set a timer for two minutes, and see who can write down the most words that begin with that letter, and I definitely see them using Ġapp.. (Teacher H)

# Online dictionaries versus traditional dictionaries

Similar to Interviewee B, Interviewee C also said that Ġabra is free, and thus, unlike traditional dictionaries, is available to everyone accessing the internet, “Ġabra,is not expensive at all because it is free, as opposed to a typical dictionary” (Teacher C).

All participants revealed that Ġabra is easier to use than a tradional dictionaryby ML2 adult learners. This supports Divekar et  al. (2021) and Lee et  al. (2016), who claim that once downloaded or accessed on the internet, online dictionaries can easily be used by L2 learners. Interviewee A said that the Ġabra app is easily downloadable and saved on students’ electronic devices, thus easily accessible when it is required to be used.

In my opinion, the Ġabra online dictionary is a device that students can bring with them or an app that they can download from the internet or search for online. It is easier to use than a traditional dictionary. (Teacher A)

Echoing Interviewee A, Interviewee I said that online dictionaries are easier to use because they allow users to search for word definitions faster than hardcopy dictionaries.

Online dictionaries are easier to use since they allow users to search for definitions faster than hardcopy dictionaries. (Teacher I)

Consistent with Mohamad et  al. (2017), the study confirmed that ML2 teachers prefer online dictionaries mainly because students do not need to carry bulky printed dictionaries and are easy to use compared to traditional dictionaries. With an online dictionary, a student can make use of it anywhere and anytime, as the following teachers stated.

Students can make extensive use of the online dictionary in class, when travelling, or when they’re in a rush. (Teacher E)

Students can acquire new vocabulary by using online dictionaries, which they can carry with them wherever they go. Hence, students can learn new words practically anywhere. (Teacher I)

It is handy for students to use on their phone, tablet or PC. They can operate it in class without having to flip through pages, and the obvious benefit is that they never have to carry an extremely bulky book. (Teacher J)

Most L2 learners are moving towards the online dictionary instead of using traditional dictionaries because it is time-saving (Karsenti, 2019). Mohamad et  al. (2017) claim that printed dictionaries consume a lot of time as they require users to patiently flip through the pages until they get to the targeted word definition. Based on the results, it was evident that Ġabra plays a crucial role in helping students to save time.

Ġabra can reduce the amount of time a student spends looking for words. The student will be less irritated when looking for a word. (Teacher F)

Online dictionaries have been consistently regarded as being more convenient than traditional dictionaries due to their portability and flexibility (Schiff, 2021). From the study, it was evident that teachers view Ġabra as being convenient to use. Teacher C said, “Ġabra is more convenient!” This expression indicates that the respondent is ranking convenience as the most important reason for using Ġabra. Modern lifestyles are highly busy, leading people to choose the most convenient options when performing various activities.

Seven interviewees said that Ġabra could assist learners more than traditional dictionaries since “it includes not just the definition or translation of the word, but also its derivatives and inflections, such as verbs, adjectives and adverbs derived from a word/noun” (Teacher F). This is consistent with the assertion by Briggs (2018) that although conventional dictionaries tend to provide meanings, their translations are not as effective as those provided by online dictionaries. In support to Teacher F, Interviewee G said:

Ġabra can assist learners in quickly learning how to conjugate particular verbs in different tenses and aspects and instantly have access to all of the word’s derivations. (Teacher G)

Ġabra is indeed instrumental in enabling ML2 learners to determine not only the meaning of words, but also their origins, derivatives and inflections. Furthermore, Ġabra provides examples of sentences including the particular words that were sought through the ‘examples’ feature as shown in Table 15.

Six teachers mentioned the importance of Ġabra’s sentence construction examples for students’ ML2 acquisition.

Ġabra provides examples of sentences with particular words which is very valuable to enhance the students’ sentence construction. However, it should provide more examples and not just examples of sentences of related words to the words sought. (Teacher B)

As Teacher B explicitly indicated, the six teachers who noted the value of sentence construction examples reported the importance of more examples of sentences of words in Ġabra, not merely related words to the words sought.

# No need to know the basic words of a language

International students who have not studied Arabic may struggle to recognise the basic verb in Maltese because, like Semitic languages, Maltese has no infinitive verb form; and the basic verb in Maltese is the Mamma, which is the third Person Singular in the perfective. Unlike in languages such as English, where one can easily identify the basic verb of a conjugated verb and thus look it up in the dictionary, for example, the basic verb of ‘they go out’ is ‘to go out’, because the verb either remains the same or hardly changes; in Maltese, it is very difficult to recognise the basic verb of a conjugated verb such as ‘joħorġu’ (they go out) whose basic verb (i.e. the verb that one can find in a traditional dictionary) is ‘ħareġ’ (he went out), and there is no pattern how one can realise the basic verb of a conjugated verb.

It is fantastic that a learner who does not know what the Mamma verb is may still look for a verb that is not conjugated in the Mamma, such as ‘toqogħdu’ (you live) on Ġabra. So the student could still search for the verb ‘toqogħdu’ to know its meaning and Ġabra will automatically show the learner the Mamma verb of this verb which is ‘qagħad’ (he lived) and its conjugation in the perfective, imperfective, and imperative forms.This happens also for nouns such as the plural ‘ħwienet’ (shops). (Teacher B)

Therefore, another advantage of Ġabra mentioned by the participants is that, unlike traditional dictionaries, there is no need to know the basic verb/noun/adjective (i.e. the Mamma/Singular masculine) to look for a word, as stated by Teacher B and shown in Tables 12–14.

# Internet reliance

Online dictionaries require the internet for users to access it. The internet has become a crucial tool in the modern education context (Potkonjak,

2020). Besides its instrumentality in enabling students to access class learning materials, the internet is also crucial in private studies and enabling learners to access information, including dictionaries when learning an L2 (Hoshi, 2002). Failure to access the internet reduces the amount of SLA that students can access, as the following educator mentioned.

In my opinion, Ġabra, is useful, but students must have internet connection. Some of my students who live in refugee camps in Ħal Far have poor internet access; meaning that the internet occasionally works, but most of the time it does not. (Teacher H)

This means that students who do not have readily available internet may not effectively use Ġabra in learning ML2. According to Camilleri (2018), web-based dictionaries require a reliable and strong connection to the internet, which makes it somewhat inaccessible to students who do not have decent internet connectivity.

# Pronunciation

When L2 students learn a new word, they should know how to pronounce it appropriately. As a result, because pronunciation is so vital in communication, and mispronunciation can lead to failure in communication, it is critical to utilize electronic dictionaries for pronunciation improvement and practice (Metruk, 2017). However, unlike several online dictionaries, Ġabra gives phonemic representations of words rather than pronunciations, which is the same as found in printed dictionaries such as Aquilina’s (1990). In this sense, learners must be linguistically literate to understand the phonemic representations of words and pronounce them correctly.

Since not all ML2 adult learners understand phonemic representations of words, all ML2 educators in this research proposed that a native speaker’s recording of the words should be included in Ġabra so that ML2 learners may learn the pronunciation of words. For example, the following educators proposed adding a pronunciation feature to Ġabra to improve the ML2 students’ pronunciation skill.

It will be cooler if every word in Ġabra is recorded by a Maltese native speaker. In this way, the students will have the opportunity to listen to the pronunciation of the words and try to repeat it. (Teacher B)

With the pronunciation feature, Ġabra will be more complete, just like other online dictionaries. It will surely assist students in learning the accurate pronunciation of words and it will definitely be better than any other hardbound dictionary. (Teacher I)

Specifically, Goksel and Bozkurt (2019) noted that an online dictionary usually has buttons that enable L2 learners to improve their pronunciation through listening and practising, and most L2 students prefer using online dictionaries because they help them to perfect their pronunciation. Thus, according to the present study, it is important to insert the pronunciation feature in Ġabra perhaps through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications which are used in AI-enabled lexicons.

Many times, my students have told me that they prefer online dictionaries since we live in a technologically dominated age, and it also encourages them to achieve perfect pronunciation. However, they find this pronunciation feature lacking in Ġabra. (Teacher K)

# Limitations of the study

The study relied on the comments of only eleven teachers of ML2 adult learners. Furthermore, the study relied on non-probability, purposeful sampling to select the participants. Such a small sample size implies that the results cannot be generalisable to populations outside the context.

# Recommendations for future studies

Future researchers may consider replicating this topic of an online lexicon to enhance learners’ SLA to other larger populations of teachers and students. Larger sample sizes should also be considered to increase the generalisability of the findings. Comparative studies covering inter-institutions and different courses may also be considered to generate more robust findings that can be used to guide both theory and practice.

This study also recommends AI-enabled dictionaries particularly to help ML2 learners with their pronunciation of Maltese. Until now, there are no AI-enabled dictionaries in Maltese.

# Conclusion

This study aimed to investigate teachers’ opinions and pedagogy of the online Maltese dictionary Ġabra for adults learning ML2. Although previous studies had focused on the realities of online dictionaries in learning L2, there is a lack of research focusing on the usage of the Maltese-English-Maltese Ġabra e-dictionary and the pedagogy of online dictionaries. This study could easily refer to any other L2 online lexicon and SLA.

The current study adopted a case study approach to collect qualitative data from a purposefully selected sample of eleven teachers of adult learners of ML2. The findings reveal that online dictionaries such as Ġabra are convenient because users do not have to carry bulky dictionaries, but only carry their phones/tablets with the particular downloaded dictionary, and thuscan learn new words practically anywhere (Lee et  al., 2016). The study showed that Ġabra is easy to use (Mohamad et  al., 2017) and there is no need for students to know the basic noun/ verb/adjective when searching for a word.The study also includes a variety of pedagogical activities that demonstrate how the Ġabra online dictionary is employed in class.

Despite its numerous advantages, Ġabra was found to exhibit incompleteness and just like other online lexicons it contained some errors. Like other online dictionaries, Ġabra relies on internet connectivity, which may exclude some users from adopting it. Furthermore, unlike several online dictionaries, this study shows that Ġabra does not provide a better option than a traditional dictionary for enabling ML2 learners to sharpen their pronunciations of Maltese words, and thus this is not consistent with Yang et  al. (2019). This might also be because certain online dictionaries employ AI applications, whereas Ġabra does not.

Unfortunately, there are some errors in Ġabra which was created by the system that are not present in traditional dictionaries. Hence, educators and students should continue to correct these errors to perfect the quality of Ġabra. Regularly updating it, inserting more sentence examples and the pronunciation feature could be the best ways to enhance Ġabra’s effectiveness for ML2 acquisition. Consequently, learners can trust an online dictionary like Ġabra to help them learn an L2.
