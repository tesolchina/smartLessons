# ABSTRACT

This intervention study examined the writing abilities of 1st (ages 6–7) and 2nd (ages 7–8) grade students in the Basque Autonomous Community, utilising Basque, Spanish, and English. We compared two distinct teaching methodologies: the PYCTO methodology, which employs a multilingual approach for teaching writing across the three languages, and the traditional monolingual approach, focusing on one language only. 873 compositions written in these languages were analysed using quantitative methods. Lexical richness was evaluated using analytic measures, while holistic measures assessed overall writing competence in four dimensions. The results indicated that students taught using the PYCTO methodology significantly outperformed those taught with the traditional monolingual approach in both 1st and 2nd grades. This finding underscores the effectiveness of multilingual teaching methods over the conventional monolingual approach, suggesting that integrating various known languages in teaching offers substantial benefits in language learning.

# Introduction

The PYCTO methodology, originated in Barcelona in 2012, has been a significant development in the realm of multilingual education. Initially introduced in the Ciutat Vella district of Barcelona from 2013 onwards, its effectiveness in enhancing the quality of narrative and explanatory texts in Catalan and Spanish was observed in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades of primary education in six public schools. This study, conducted by linguists from the University of Barcelona (see Ballesteros 2019), evaluated the impact of PYCTO methodology on students’ reading and writing performance over a 3-year period (2013–2016). Among the results related to writing performance, it is remarkable, that students who had learned through this methodology tripled the use of structural indicators in texts, which was four times the impact obtained by students in the control school. On the other hand, the length of the texts produced by the students who had learned through PYCTO methodology doubled during this period, which was three times the impact of the students in the control school.

On this occasion, PYCTO methodology, which integrates the principles of Translanguaging, was piloted by the Basque Government during the 2021/2022 academic year to improve oral expression and literacy in the three primary education languages: Basque, Spanish, and English, and this intervention is the one we will report in this article. As we will explain, integral to PYCTO is the adoption of a Translanguaging perspective, where the three curricular languages are interrelated in all activities. This approach permits comparative analysis of grammar and lexicon across languages, enabling students to seamlessly transition among them, enhancing understanding and acquisition. For instance, in writing a collaborative narrative in English, students can explore necessary lexicon in Basque and Spanish, and vice versa. This method not only facilitates simultaneous language learning but also fosters students’ metalinguistic awareness, thereby adopting a stronger multilingual approach to language teaching within the concept of Pedagogical Translanguaging (see Cenoz and Gorter 2021, for a review).

In the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC), a bilingual region with Spanish as the majority language, Basque as a regional minority language, and English as a curricular foreign language, the PYCTO programme aligns with the Integrated Language Curriculum (ILC) developed since 1990. The ILC aims to facilitate linguistic transfer between languages and improve the quality of the teaching-learning process by coordinating the curriculum of the three languages in a unified manner. PYCTO, in this context, represents a progression from traditional monolingual teaching, as it employs all three languages simultaneously in each task, moving beyond the ILC’s approach that, while reducing monolingual bias, still treats languages separately in class.

In this study, we focus exclusively on the results gathered for writing skills, analysing the impact of the PYCTO methodology in the first and second grades of primary education across three typologically different languages. This approach marks a novel implementation of the PYCTO methodology, building upon its proven benefits in bilingual contexts and exploring its potential in a tri-lingual educational setting.

# Theoretical framework

# The add-on value of a multilingual approach for language teaching

In the realm of language education, the integration of a multilingual approach has gained momentum in recent years. This approach underscores the holistic development of linguistic skills, leveraging the entire language repertoire of learners rather than isolating individual languages. Emphasising a holistic perspective in language teaching, research studies highlight the significance of considering all languages known by the learners, challenging traditional monolingual biases and incorporating practices like Translanguaging (Cenoz and Gorter 2011; García 2011).

Incorporating a multilingual approach into language learning offers several advantages, including cognitive flexibility, as highlighted by Bialystok (2017). Multilingual individuals often exhibit enhanced cognitive control and the ability to seamlessly switch between languages, adapting to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts while fostering diverse thinking and writing styles. Additionally, engaging with multiple languages concurrently has been shown to elevate language awareness and sensitivity, as Jessner (2006) and Cook (1995) assert. Multilingualism deepens awareness of language subtleties, grammar, and syntax, transcending individual languages and ultimately improving overall linguistic proficiency. Therefore, research indicates that multilingual approaches like Translanguaging promote creative language usage and facilitate the breakdown of language barriers, enabling students to express themselves more authentically (Cenoz and Gorter 2021; García 2011).

Finally, studies involving language teachers also reveal an acknowledgment of multilingualism as a beneficial asset in language teaching (Gartziarena and Villabona 2022; Gartziarena, Villabona, and Olave 2023). These educators often employ students’ knowledge of other languages in their teaching, although the transfer of learning strategies across languages is sometimes overlooked (Haukås 2016).

# Pedagogical translanguaging and multilingual writing

The PYCTO methodology, as demonstrated at https://pictoescritura.com/, incorporates the principles of Pedagogical Translanguaging into the realm of multilingual education, with a specific emphasis on enhancing multilingual writing skills. This approach aligns closely with the scholarly work of Cenoz and Gorter, who stress the significance of harnessing student’s entire linguistic repertoire in the process of acquiring and using additional languages (Cenoz 2013; Cenoz and Gorter

2011; 2014; 2021). It is also consistent with studies that illustrate how students employ their entire linguistic repertoire in their writing endeavours (see Cenoz and Gorter 2011; De Angelis and Jessner 2012; Kobayashi and Rinnert 2013; Orcasitas-Vicandi, 2018; 2020; 2022a; 2022b).

In the present intervention study, we analysed 1st and 2nd-grade students’ unconstrained writing skills related to language, specifically their overall writing abilities and lexical richness, as crucial aspects in their developmental stage. This focus provided us with insights into their early literacy development and allowed an age-appropriate evaluation. As described by Snow and Matthews (2016), unconstrained skills such as vocabulary, grammar, story structure, telling narratives and giving descriptions are especially important to children’s long-term literacy outcomes, but their open-ended nature makes them complex to test for. By combining an assessment of overall unconstrained writing skills related to language, we aimed to gain understanding of young students’ language development, benefiting both education and pedagogy in early childhood.

In this way, PT interventions have shown to be beneficial in vocabulary acquisition and writing skills in our context with three distant curricular languages: a majority language (Spanish), a regional minority language (Basque) and English as the global language. The study by Cenoz, Leonet, and Gorter (2022) examined the impact of PT on multilingual primary school students’ cognate awareness. The study focused on students fluent in Basque and Spanish, learning a third language, investigating how linguistic factors and teaching methods affect cognate recognition and metalinguistic awareness. Two student groups were studied: one receiving translanguaging-based intervention and another following regular language classes. While cognate identification was influenced by cognate characteristics and not first language, the intervention group demonstrated improved cognate awareness, though not necessarily better cognate identification skills compared to the control group. These findings underscore the potential benefits of Translanguaging in multilingual education. Similarly, Leonet, Cenoz, and Gorter (2020) investigated the impact of PT on developing morphological awareness in English among primary school students fluent in Basque and Spanish. The research involved an experimental group participating in a pedagogical intervention designed to enhance morphological awareness through PT. These strategies enabled the students to utilise their existing linguistic repertoire across Basque, Spanish, and English, thereby leveraging their multilingual resources for language learning. Results from the study indicated a significant improvement in morphological awareness among students in the experimental group compared to their peers in the control group. Additionally, the experimental group students reported positive perceptions on PT, finding it both helpful for their language learning and enjoyable as a teaching method. Consequently, PT interventions have been shown to have a positive impact on metalinguistic awareness, leading to improvements in vocabulary acquisition and writing skills in multilingual educational settings, encompassing diverse languages such as Spanish, Basque, and English (see also Orcasitas-Vicandi 2020).

Furthermore, the PYCTO methodology empowers students to naturally apply their existing language skills when learning new languages, and research has demonstrated the benefits of this approach, even in the context of writing. Consequently, Translanguaging strategies have shown to be significant in supporting multilingual learners’ academic success and personal growth, as they allow students to utilise their multilingual resources in writing practices, enhancing their confidence and collaboration (Song, Howard, and Olazabal-Arias 2022). Moreover, some researchers foster a more inclusive writing environment by advocating for ‘translingual approaches’. In their article ‘I write to show how beautiful my languages are’: Translingual Writing Instruction in English-Dominant Classrooms, Zapata and Laman (2016) advocate for the incorporation of students’ linguistic diversity, encouraging the use of multiple languages in the writing process. This translingual approach not only supports multilingual students but also fosters a more inclusive and authentic writing environment, enabling students to appreciate and utilise their linguistic backgrounds, ultimately enriching the overall learning experience in the classroom. Thus, the importance of including and leveraging students’ entire linguistic repertoires in the context of writing, underscoring the interconnectivity and mutual reinforcement of different languages in a student’s learning process is being demonstrated (Kobayashi and Rinnert 2013; Orcasitas-Vicandi, 2018; 2020; 2022a; 2022b).

# Literacy and soft skills

PYCTO, as its founder states (Ballesteros 2019), addresses literacy from a globalised vision that incorporates the contributions of educational, psycholinguistic and neurocognitive sciences to create contexts where students experience the process of creating and writing their own stories as a successful experience. This programme aims to stimulate social skills known as soft skills − such as creativity, communication, critical thinking and collaboration− (Sarsekeyeva and Skakova 2020), and promote a meaningful and stimulated use of writing. To do this, it combines the use of texts of different types and in different media (paper, internet, audiovisual) both when students receive the information and when they produce it.

Therefore, this methodological proposal tackles literacy from a communicative approach (Richards and Rodgers 2001; Valério and De Almeida Mattos 2018) through creativity, multimodality and collaborative work. While creativity is still a relatively new area of study with limited research on the connection between creativity and academic achievement (Gajda 2016), it has been proved that stimulating creativity can improve children’s writing skills (Grainger, Goouch, and Lambirth 2005; Hiatt and Rooke 2013; Göçen 2019). Accordingly, the study conducted by Segundo-Marcos et al. (2020) has demonstrated that writing exercises carried out through cooperative learning can enhance children’s ability to think creatively or divergently.

In an effort to more effectively meet the variety of learning styles, PYCTO focuses on teaching in a comprehensive manner, that is, based on the simultaneous and continuous interaction of all expressive modalities: oral language, written language, and visual language. Multimodal scaffolding can enrich children’s writing processes (Bearne and Wolstencroft 2007; Cordero et al. 2018; Jewitt 2008; Vincent 2006). In this instance, learning the fundamentals of textual composition is aided by the simultaneous use of two languages – verbal and visual (see Appendix 1). Students can construct contexts, come up with hypotheses and new ideas thanks to visual thinking and the suggested exercises. This methodology is transferred to the classroom through a digital platform that is structured in three different blocks: a digital picture book, students’ production of a narrative text and language games. Through the characters of the digital picture book students explore different textual typologies. Each page offers them various proposals for working on textual creation and production. Besides, the digital platform provides a personalised itinerary of language games for each student. The programme evaluates students’ performance in key linguistic skills − such as vocabulary, spelling, morphology and syntax, punctuation, structure and reading comprehension−, and proposes activities adapted to their needs.

Being that so, in this study, we aimed at exploring whether a multilingual methodology based on PT (i.e. the PCYTO methodology) could favour to a larger extent the acquisition of writing the three curricular languages and in primary education. In order to do so, we worded our interests in the following research questions:

Research question 1: Does the PYCTO methodology (i.e. translanguaging pedagogies) influence students’ unconstrained writing skills related to language, such as lexical richness, suitability, organisation, vocabulary and use of language in the three languages?

Research question 2: Is there a significant difference between the improvement achieved by students using the PYCTO methodology (i.e. translanguaging pedagogies) and the students using traditional methodologies and monolingual pedagogies in their literacy skills in the three languages?

# Methodology

# Participants

Twelve schools of primary education participated in this study; six control schools and six schools that implemented the PYCTO programme in their classrooms of 1st and 2nd grade of primary education. Overall, then, we analysed the results of the 205 students learning with the PYCTO methodology in these six centres. This sample can be seen in detail in the following Table 1:

In order to compare the results obtained with equivalent groups of students, a control school was established for each experimental school. These control schools worked with traditional literacy methodologies and monolingual pedagogies in order to provide a comparative for the PYCTO programme’s multilingual pedagogies and innovative methodology. The selection of the control schools was conducted by the ISEI-IVEI (Basque Institute for Educational Research and Evaluation) according to the socioeconomic, cultural and linguistic context of the school and equivalent schools were selected. The details for each control school are shown in the following Table 2:

Therefore, in total, the data of 399 students was collected and analysed in order to conduct this study.

# Procedure

Regarding the programme used for the intervention, we need to explain that the PYCTO methodology uses the image as a tool to learn to read and write, to develop creative thinking and progressively master visual, oral and written language in L1, L2 and FL. It is a globalised method that approaches the teaching of languages in context, promoting creativity, visual thinking and meaningful use of L1, L2 and the FL.

The PYCTO programme provides an extensive collection of activities and proposes diverse dynamics in order to promote the multilingual approach within the classroom. The whole learning process aims the collaborative production of narrative texts and in order to do so, students are provided with pictures that hold different scenes, which they need to analyse and discuss together: what the scene is about, who the characters are, where the scene is located, what might happen next, etc. From this point onwards, they begin to build the story using their L1, L2 and the FL. While they might work on the description of the scene in the L1, they might build the personalities of the characters’ in the L2 and work on specific vocabulary in the FL. The comparison and interaction of vocabulary in the three languages is one of the bottom lines of the programme too.

This programme offers the student a personalised itinerary for evaluation and continuous reinforcement of language skills (vocabulary, spelling, morphology, syntax, and reading comprehension) in L1, L2 and FL. Moreover, the PYCTO methodology was designed based on the understanding that the development of expression is a process that occurs in an integral way, that is, based on the simultaneous and continuous interaction of all expressive modalities: oral language, written language and visual language in L1, L2 and FL. In this way, it encourages the metalinguistic reflection since students explicitly observe the differences and similarities between the languages they know when comparing them, and easily transfer this knowledge from one to the other.

As mentioned in the introduction, then, we analysed the effect of the intervention by considering reading comprehension and written production. Yet, in this paper, we will focus on the latter and the process was as follows. The 399 students of the 1st and 2nd grades of primary education of the twelve schools completed a pretest (September, 2021) and a posttest (May, 2022) consisting of the writing of a narrative text in each of the languages (Basque, Spanish and English) (six texts per student in total). Considering the absence of some of these students due to medical issues (COVID, etc.) we collected 924 tests in 1st grade and 822 tests in 2nd grade. Yet, only the ones shown in Table 3 stayed as valid as some of these students failed to take one test or the other (the pre- and/or the posttest). That is, we finally analysed the $7 9 , 7 9 \%$ of PE1 texts (462 texts in September and 462 in May) and the $6 6 , 5 5 \%$ of PE2 texts (411 texts in both, the pretest and the posttest).

# Instrument

As noted above, the narrative texts written in the three languages (Basque, Spanish and English) were used for the evaluation. Thus, all the participants wrote one composition in each language (English, Basque and Spanish) before and after the intervention. Three illustrations were used for the composition writing, a different illustration for each language, but the three of them were made by the same professional illustrator following their same style and all the students had the same picture for each language.

Having collected participants’ compositions in the three languages, they were both analytically and holistically evaluated. Analytically, two measures were considered which have been related to the overall quality of the text: the number of words and the number of different words (a type/ token approach) (see Lee et al. 2009; Malvern et al., 2004). Following the findings of previous studies on assessment of early elementary writing (see McKenna et al. 2021; 2022), we evaluated the compositions in the three languages using a revised rubric (see Appendix 2). The 873 compositions were then evaluated in order to obtain scores for adequacy, organisation, vocabulary and language use. Each skill was scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (never occurring) to 5 (occurring accurately almost always) based on a number of descriptors for each skill and no specific score was designed for any descriptor. The entire rubric was used to score all of the writing samples collected, so the maximum score that could be obtained was 20 points. After a training in the use of the rubric in order to avoid any inconsistencies with its use, two evaluators assessed the 873 compositions, and the inter-rater reliability was calculated and varied from 0.73 to 0.85. To be precise, the English compositions scored at 0.73, Spanish compositions scored at 0.78 and Basque compositions scored at 0.85. Finally, the analysis of results analysis was processed using the programme SPSS Statistics 29.

# Results

In order to answer our research questions, several one-way between subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted between experimental $( N = 1 9 4 )$ and control school students $( N = 2 0 5 )$ . In all the cases the level of statistical significance (S) used was $p < . 0 5$ .

As mentioned in the methodological section, all compositions were analysed both analytically, the number of words and different words (i.e. lexical richness), and holistically using the rubric presented in Appendix 2. Tables 4 and 5 show the results gathered with the analytic measures in first and second grade in these categories:

As shown in Table 5, first-graders’ development according to the number of words (tokens) and the number of different words (types) written in their compositions in the three curricular languages indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the experimental groups and the control groups. The differences between the two groups of participants in Basque compositions were statistically significant in the number of words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 9 ) = 5 9 . 8 1 6 , p < . 0 0 1$ and in the number of different words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 9 ) = 6 6 . 0 6 5 , p < . 0 0 1$ . Similarly, the differences between the two groups of participants in Spanish compositions were statistically significant in the number of words ${ \sf F } ( 1 . 1 6 7 ) =$ 52.888, $p < . 0 0 1$ and in the number of different words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 7 ) = 5 1 . 9 6 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . And also in English, the differences between the two groups of participants were statistically significant in the number of words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 2 1 ) = 2 0 . 0 8 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ and in the number of different words ${ \sf F } ( 1 . 1 2 1 ) =$ 19.266, $p < . 0 0 1$ . Therefore, the PYCTO methodology appeared to have a significant effect on the lexical production of first-grade students in the three languages even if both groups had an overall increase in their lexical production. Moreover, in the case of Spanish, we could note that even if students in the experimental groups began with a lower number of words and different words, they ended up outperforming their peers in the control groups.

As shown in Table 5, we also found statistically significant differences between the groups in the second grade. The differences between the two groups of participants in Basque compositions were statistically significant in the number of words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 4 3 ) = 7 7 . 5 9 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ and in the number of different words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 4 3 ) = 7 8 . 0 6 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . Additionally, the differences between the two groups of participants in Spanish compositions were statistically significant in the number of words F $( 1 . 1 4 4 ) = 1 7 . 6 6 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ and also in the number of different words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 4 4 ) = 2 4 . 3 4 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . And finally, the differences between the two groups of participants in English compositions were statistically significant in the number of words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 1 6 ) = 1 6 . 4 8 5 ,$ $p < . 0 0 1$ and in the number of different words $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 1 6 ) = 1 5 . 2 1 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . Consequently, experimental students also outperformed control school students in second-grade. Also in this case, it is interesting to note that experimental school students began with a lower number of words and different words, and ended up outperforming their peers in the control groups. Thus, in Figures 1–4 we see this development graphically.

Regarding the holistic measures, four dimensions were distinguished: the suitability of the composition $( \mathsf { m a x } = 5$ points), the organisation of the text $( \mathsf { m a x } = 5$ points), the adequacy of the vocabulary used $\mathtt { ( m a x = 5 }$ points), and the use of the languages $( \mathsf { m a x } = 5$ points). Thus, in Table 6, we show the results of the one-way between subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted for first-grade students.

As shown in Table 6, our results showed that there were statistically significant differences in all the analytic dimensions for the Basque language: for the dimensions of suitability $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 9 ) =$ $3 9 . 5 6 0 < . 0 0 1 $ , organisation $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 9 ) = 1 0 . 7 4 8 ,$ $p = . 0 0 1$ , vocabulary $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 9 ) = 5 3 . 4 1 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , and use of language $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 9 ) = 4 5 . 2 5 1$ 1, $p < . 0 0 1$ . Furthermore, we also found statistically significant

differences for the Spanish language in the suitability $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 7 ) = 1 8 . 9 6 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ and the vocabulary measure $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 7 ) = 2 9 . 7 8 0 , p < . 0 0 1$ . Yet, we found that these differences were not statistically significant for the organisation measure $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 7 ) = . 0 7 5$ , $p = . 7 8 5$ nor for the use of language measure $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 6 7 ) = 3 . 7 5 1$ , $p = . 0 5 4$ . Finally, regarding English, we found a statistically significant difference for the dimension of suitability $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 2 1 ) = 6 . 2 9 9$ , $p = . 0 1 3$ . Yet, we did not find a statistically significant difference for vocabulary $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 2 1 ) = 2 . 0 9 4$ , $p = . 1 5 1$ . Noteworthy is again that, in Spanish, at the beginning of the school year, experimental students’ holistic scores were lower in some cases than control students’ scores and, yet, they outperformed their peers at the end of the school year (e.g. in vocabulary), and that we could not gather any score for English organisation and language as for many students it was their first contact with English and did not write enough as to evaluate it.

As shown in Table 7, our results showed that there were statistically significant differences in all the analytic dimensions for the three languages. In Basque, we found these differences in the dimension of suitability $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 4 3 ) = 3 7 . 3 5 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , organisation $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 4 3 ) = 4 5 . 6 2 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , vocabulary F $( 1 . 1 4 3 ) = 5 1 . 1 9 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ and use of language $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 4 3 ) = 2 8 . 1 5 6$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ .

Finally, in English, these differences were found in the dimensions of suitability ${ \sf F } ( 1 . 1 1 6 ) =$ 22.311, $p < . 0 0 1$ , organisation $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 1 6 ) = 2 6 . 0 9 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , vocabulary $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 1 6 ) = 3 4 . 6 9 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ and use of language $\mathsf { F } ( 1 . 1 1 6 ) = 4 7 . 4 5 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ . Noteworthy is that, according to our results, experimental students performed worse at the end of the school year than at the beginning and this is something that we are not able to explain by our own means.

# Conclusion and discussion

The aim of the present study was to explore the written development of multilingual learners in first and second years of primary education considering the three curricular languages (Basque, Spanish and English). Overall, our results showed that experimental students outperformed students in the control groups both in the 1st and the 2nd grades of primary education. This happened in the three languages in the 1st grade, and just in Basque and Spanish in the 2nd grade. Moreover, sometimes the initial results of the experimental groups were lower than that of the control groups, so the improvement was even more evident. Besides, according to the holistic scores, the overall assessment showed also a significantly greater improvement in the experimental groups, both in Basque and Spanish. Furthermore, as happened with the number of words, this happened even when the pretests of the experimental groups were graded lower than those of the control groups in the pretests. In this way, we need to note the case of English compositions in 2nd grade where the posttests showed lower results than the pretests in three unconstrained writing skills related to language (suitability, vocabulary and use of language). This phenomenon might probably be related to an incident or a misunderstanding in the way the task was presented to the students more than to their actual writing skills.

Regarding the pedagogical implications, our results support several important claims regarding multilingual acquisition as they show that multilinguals take a greater advantage in language learning if they use their entire linguistic repertoire (see Cenoz and Gorter 2011; 2014; Cenoz, Leonet, and Gorter 2022; Herdina and Jessner 2002; Leonet, Cenoz, and Gorter 2017; 2020). In our opinion, then, the main contribution of our study is showing that languages are better acquired and processed if they are dynamically interconnected in the classrooms. According to Otwinowska (2016), ‘when several languages are learned, the learner does not begin at the basic level in each case, but rather continually extends the existing language knowledge’ (242). Consequently, language teaching should be focused on using all the available linguistic resources in each specific context. In this sense, one of the limitations of the PYCTO programme is that of not relating the learning of the curricular languages to students’ home languages. This limitation is worth emphasising and addressing in language education because it represents a missed opportunity for maximising the linguistic resources available to multilingual learners. When students are encouraged to draw on their home languages alongside their curricular languages, they can benefit from a more holistic and interconnected language learning experience. This approach aligns with research findings that suggest multilinguals acquire languages more effectively when they utilise their entire linguistic repertoire, and not only the curricular languages, also in our context (Orcasitas-Vicandi and PeralesFernández-de-Gamboa 2022; Perales-Fernández-de-Gamboa and Orcasitas-Vicandi in press).

Incorporating students’ home languages into language instruction not only enhances their language development but also promotes a sense of linguistic identity and cultural inclusion (Orcasitas-Vicandi and Perales-Fernández-de-Gamboa 2022). It recognises the richness of linguistic diversity in the classroom and empowers students to leverage their existing language knowledge to learn new languages more efficiently. Therefore, the absence of such an approach in the PYCTO programme represents a notable limitation, and addressing it could significantly improve language education by fostering a more comprehensive and inclusive learning environment for multilingual learners.

Following this line of reasoning, in our context, the Integrated Language Curriculum (ILC) approach aims at cross-referencing the three curricular languages (Basque, Spanish and English) and this potentially facilitates that teachers promote the transference of knowledge across languages (O’Duibhir and Cummins 2012). Yet, there are still some steps to be taken in order to apply a stronger multilingual approach to literacy in primary education. Among these steps, using pedagogies that explicitly facilitate the comparison between the languages that students know in different levels (e.g. lexical, morphological, at a discourse level) could help students deduce similarities and differences between the languages they know fostering the acquisition process (Cenoz, Leonet, and Gorter 2022; Leonet, Cenoz, and Gorter 2017; 2020). Moreover, and as mentioned above, this idea does not apply exclusively to curricular languages (Basque, Spanish and English), but to all the languages present in our classrooms (i.e. students’ home languages). This methodological change will require not only to develop further the Integrated Language Curriculum (ILC), but to train language teachers in the resources they will find in their multilingual classrooms (see Orcasitas-Vicandi and Perales-Fernández-de-Gamboa 2024).

Overall, the unique and significant contribution of this research lies in its empirical validation of the PYCTO methodology’s effectiveness in enhancing multilingual writing skills among primary school students. This study not only reinforces the pedagogical benefits of utilising a multilingual approach over traditional monolingual methods but also extends the application of the PYCTO methodology to a trilingual educational context, incorporating Basque, Spanish, and English. The study’s findings offer substantial evidence supporting the integration of multiple known languages in teaching. This approach not only enhances linguistic proficiency across different languages but also promotes cognitive flexibility and linguistic awareness among young learners. By demonstrating significant improvements in both lexical richness and overall writing competence in all three languages among students taught using the PYCTO methodology, we provide concrete evidence that multilingual teaching methods can foster a more robust, interconnected, and dynamic language learning environment. Furthermore, the research contributes to the field by showing how a Translanguaging perspective can be effectively implemented in primary education, particularly in a region with diverse linguistic backgrounds like the Basque Autonomous Community.
