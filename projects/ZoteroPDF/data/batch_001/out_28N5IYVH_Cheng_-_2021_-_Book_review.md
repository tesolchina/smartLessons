In the latest book in the series New Perspectives on Language and Education, Joel Bloch presents research-based information and tools for developing multilingual writers digital literacy through online spaces. Since the digital era emphasizes the importance of literacy development in virtual learning contexts, this volume is an important contribution to the feld of academic English education that helps teachers to meet the challenges that technological shifts have brought about. The book comprises eight chapters and includes an introduction to technological spaces and teaching and learning to write, four chapters on using digital literacy spaces (e.g., blogs, digital storytllig, Mo0s, and flippd cassrooms) in theteching f wrting, two chaptr on online publishing opn acces jourals and teaching writing in the publishing space), and aconcluding chapter on the current and future status of digital iteracy paces.

The first chapter of the book introduces teaching and learning to write in technological spaces. Although the world of the Internet has changed dramaticall from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0, the needs for literacy development in the writing clssroom have not diminished, and technological advancement has enabled use of aditional tols to hel students epresstheir own ideas through multimedia forms. The introduction of multimodality, with the addition of visual and aural elements, has changed the traditional meaning of literacy. As multimodal publication becomes increasingly more important in diffren felds, the need for multimodal pedagogies that connects the technology outside of the classroom to in-clas learning has also grown. For example, digital stories and blogs that were developed outside the educational sphere are now widely used in writing clases. However, decisions by teachers as to whether they will adopt a technology space and how to adopt it are influenced by students' acces and the afordances it brings to the clasroom, in line with Bloch's view that technology always serves pedagogy, not determines it (p. 42). Teachers and students play crucial role in deciding the types of technology spaces used i literacy development ince teachers are responsible not only for teaching and designing digital literacy spaces but also for choosing the appropriate information for individual students based on their familiarity with current technologies.

The second part of the book discusses the use of digital space in writing instruction for multilingual students. Blogging is regarded as a useful ool in support of more reflective and spontaneous forms of writing, and Bloch states that students may like blog writing because of the greater control it gives them over their writing without having to worr about producing the kind ofaccurate language required in formal writing assignments. Blogging offrs convenient way for students o reflect on their own thoughts over the dis cussions that they may have in writing claes and helps them connect with readers in a more informal style and personal tone. Another type of digital space is based on multimodal learning, and Bloch gives the example of digital storytelling, which provides a space for writers to emphasize on their own voice through sharing their own stories. Digita storytelling is viewed as motivational for multi lingual students because they can easily relate the task to their personal experiences by combining pictures and narrations. Fewer issues with textual borrowing have been found in digital tories due to the stronger author identit writers have over their own stories, which prompts them to use their own photos and voices instead of searching for information online.

In contrast to traditional courses that mandate the beginning and ending times, Mo0cs promote self-directed learning in which learners decide when to join and end their course participations. Although Moocs do not serve their planned purposes as a completely open online classroom space for multilingual writers, they support their literacy development by providing useful resources and addressing specificissues. The final digital learning space discussed by Bloch is the flipped classrom. This space focuses more on learner autonomy by having students study the course content in online modules before the actual class meetings, which arethen used for them to discus what they have learned and to apply the corresponding concept via interactive activitie. With the fliped learning approach, clas videos are often pre-recorded, and students are anticipated to watch the videos before joining class discussions. Bloch also named thre ways in which writing instructors can motivate learners to watch the instructional videos before clas time: 1) add captioning for the videos and keep them short and interactive; 2) create video discussion boards using tols such as Flipgrid; and 3) ask students to blog about the videos by addressing a list of questions.

In addition to teaching writing in digitl literacy spaces, Bloch discusses the isue of publishing in open acces journals and teaching writing in the publishing space. Open access journals are gaining more popularit inthe field of L2 writing reearch, and the asence of copyright restrictions means that readers are more easily able to access the articles published in open accessjournals. A major benefit of publishing in open acces journals i to atract a wider audience and to increase the citation number and the status of the author as well as the research impact of the article. However, open-aces joumals have received criticisms from both publishers and authors. publishers may complain about the higher publishing cost asociated with these journals, and some authors are not pleased about having to pay for publication and acces without receiving any compensation. Since publishing is a goal for many multilingual writers teaching writing in the publishing spac i ao critical sse to be addresd i iteracy uction. ovice writers who wish to publish their works need to consider the multiple factors asociated with publishing, including choosing an appropriate journal, understanding the peer review processand the reviewers roles, documenting thir revisions, and negotiating responses to reviewers' feedback loch comments that the "rect" and revise and resubmit categories of traditional peer reviews can easily discourage writers, who might abandon further attempt at publication.

At the end of the book, Bloch concludes that digitl literacy spaces created via new multimodal tols have challenged traditional print literacies and that both teachers and students need to be prepared to use these new tools. Being \*lifelong learners who seek ou. and use new techologies that are able to mee the diverse needs of todays students is n esential trait of scesul online language educators (Rusell & Murphy-Judy, 2021, p. 270). While teachers are taking on new roles of designers of literacy spaces, students are becoming more autonomous and connecting their own technological and personal backgrounds to online learning experiences.

Bloch's experiences in technology use in second language writing make this book a good read for teaching professionals and re searchers who want to gain a comprehensive understanding of multilingual litracy development using a variety of online tools and methods, such as blogs, digitl storytellig, Mo0s and flipped classrooms. For teachers of writers who are new to the field of online publishing, he introduces the meaning and value f open aces journals and the dferent aspects of teaching writing in the publishing space. A comparison between digital iteracy spaces and traditional academic writing helps readers understand the new digital learning contexts and their connections to the teaching and learning of academic writig. Although the benefits and constraints of digital literacy spaces have been thoroughly discussed throughout the book, more iformation about how to address current problems with digital literacy development would have been valuable. For example, since assessment remains a problematic area in digital literacies (. 240), ideas for teachers to design assessment tasks when they are using the digital toos inroduced in this book would have been useful. Although one book canot cover allth issues of importance in this broad fied, writing asessment is crucial as we move to digital writing spaces, and an important piece of the puzze. Information on topics such as designing and using online rubrics (see Rusell & Murphy-Judy, 2021, p. 173) and providing multimodal feedback via screencasting tols (see Cheng & Li, 2020) would have supplied some of these missing pieces of the puzzle and contributed to teacher development.

However, overall this book is a valuable resource book that covers a wide range of information for anyone who is interested in the teaching and research of digital literacy spaces for multilingual writers. Bloch's impartial descriptions of the various online tools help readers make their own judgements on whether and how touse them in writing instructions. His chapters on open acces journals and teaching writing in the publishing space provide timely contributions of information and advice to the community of teachers of new writers who are preparing to get published.
