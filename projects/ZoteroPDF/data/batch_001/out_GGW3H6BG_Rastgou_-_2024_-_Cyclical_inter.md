L2 Writers' Perspectives

Although different empirical studies have recently explored the L2 writing-SLA interfaces, how L2 writers modify and consolidate their linguistic knowledge with different levels of perceived complexity remains underexplored. Featuring the qualitative phase of a longitudinal, mixedmethods study with the aim of complementarity, the current study explored the perspectives of 20 low- to mid-intermediate L2 writers about how their consistent engagement in an iterative process of writing, feedback processing and rewriting contributed to L2 development. In-depth explanations and numerous script-specific exemplifications in semi-structured interviews showcased the language learning potential of acting on direct wCF on an extended number of grammatical features over time, resulting in deep wCF processing and substantial cognitive and affective engagement with feedback. Results suggested participants' reliance on the prolonged process to (re)formulate and confirm hypotheses and increasingly accumulate category-based WCF instances from previous and subsequent compositions to abstract most of the underlying rules embedded in direct wCF. The participants explained how different challenges against rule abstraction were resolved, and why some remained unresolved. The study proposes a model illustrating a synergistic interaction between writing, feedback processing and rewriting for L2 writers to gradually consolidate linguistic knowledge. Theoretical, methodological and pedagogical implications of the study are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Over the past three decades, a number of FL/ESL feedback studies have shown how written correctie feedback (WCF) facilitates L2 writers' internalizing linguistic knowledge (e.g., Qi & Lapkin, 201). The SLA-oriented focused wCF studies (e.g., Bitchener & Knoch, 2008) have demonstrated that even a single-shot WCF session would enable L2 writers to consolidate their knowledge of a single grammatical category (Bitchener, 2012). Others targeting a broader wCF scope (e.g., Bonilla Lopez, Steendam, Speelman & Buyse, 2018; Hartshorn et al., 2010; Rastgou, Storch & Knoch, 2020; Van Beuningen, De Jong & Kuiken, 2012) have reported sig. nificant development in students' overall grammatical knowledge and L2 lerning. Correspondingly, independent qualitatie studies have explored the deth of WCF processing (e.g., Caras, 2019), students reliance n feedback to develop aspects of writing ( e, 2005; McMartin-Miller, 2014) and their occasional difficulties implementing feedback (e.g., Ferris, 2018).

Some studies have further explored L2 writing-SLA interfaces, i.e., the language learning potential of 2 writing or writing-to-learn framework e.g., Hyland, 2011; Manchon & Roca de Larios., 2011). The ncessty of conducting interface studies has been reiterated both theoretically and pedagogically (e.g., Harklau, 2002; Manchon, 2011a; 2011b; Ortega, 2012) to unravel the conditions that facilitat the expansion of learners L2 knowledge through engagement in writing. While quantitative L2 writing studies explain the language learning potential of engagement with feedback, follow-up qualitative studies can illustrate a cogent understanding of the phenomenon (Greene, Caracelli & Graham, 1989) by exploring the processes through which L2 writers depart from intenalization to modify and consolidate their knowledge (Bitchener & Storch, 2016; Gass, 1997). This progression can be illuminated using a sequential equal-weight QUAN QUAL design (Riazi & Candlin, 2014) in a follow-up qualitative study into the interactive engagement of L2 writers in the writing, WCF processing and rewriting process (henceforth WR WCF RW) with the purpose of complementarity. represents the iterative/nonlinear quality of the intersections.)

The current investigation is the qualitative phase of a longitudinal mixed-methods study to illustrate the modification and consolidation of linguistic knowledge emerging from consistent engagement in the WR WCF RW process. The quantitative findings (Rastgou et al., 2020) revealed that the three treatment groups, unlike the control group, signficantly improved, and largely retained improvement, in areas (accuracy, content and organization) on which they had received feedback. Notwithstanding, only through conducting follow-up qualitative studies could we expound how students process WCF (Leow & Manchon, 2022; Revesz, Lu & Pel. licer-Sanchez, 2022) and what features interact with treatment to improve accuracy (Kang & Han, 2015). This study, therefore, aimed to explain the contribution of direct wCF to accuracy development, hypothesis testing, rule induction, and students' potential obstacles and strategies in this process.

# 2. Theoretical backgrounds

The current study pursued a theoretical/pedagogical agenda concerning "whether writing leads to the expansion and/or the consolidation of 2 knowledge, and if so, when, how, and why" (Manchon & Roca de Larios, 2011, p. 201). To explain the contributions of L2 writig n leaning, Williams (2012 p.32 draws onHousen and Prrard's (2005) macro-processclassfication of L2 knowledge acquisition, comprising internalization, i. "establish[ing] form-meaning connections as a result of noticing and processing selected input", modification, i.e. "continu[ing] to elaborate and refine [the form-meaning conections] i response to additional input", and consolidation, i.e., strengthen[ing] [learners'] L2 knowledge through repeated retrieval and deeper processing" Drawing on Gass (1997) computational framework of input processng and explicit/implicit knowledge development, Bitchener and Storch (2016) introduce five stages that 2 writers progres through in a single writing/feedback-processing episode. I Stage 1, L2 writersattend to WCF targeting a specific linguistic gap. In Stage 2, they comprehend the WCF point depending on its explicitness and their linguistic knowledge. In Stage 3, they employ their knowledge to analyze gaps, testher hypotheses about accurate use, and establish knowledge internalization. In Stage 4, their hypotheses may be either confirmed or reected and reformulated. They may also gather similar WCF points to asses hypothesis precision and ultimately modif knowledge. In Stage 5, they produce output but, even if accurate, some forms might be erroneous in subsequent texts due to their inadequate attentional control of appropriate forms during production. Bitchener and Storch (2016, p. 25) argue that the iteration of the input/intake/uptake/output processleads to knowledge consolidation, and that"meaningful practice that i sustained over time" i cetral to L2 writers "less controlled" and 'more rapid, automatized processing'" Similarly, DeKeyser (2007) postulates that the newly learned knowledge "is not yet robust and fine-tuned", and demands extensive practice to minimize the "reaction time" "error rate, and "interfrence with/from other tasks" (pp. 98-99). A longitudinal study with repeated (re)writing and feedback-processing episodes can explore how the newly developed knowledge "can become part of the developing L2 system" (Williams, 2012, p. 328).

# 3. Empirical studies of wCF effects on L2 development

There have been two frameworks of inquiry concerning written feedback studies: L2 writing development and L2 development or knowledge consolidation (Bichener  Storch, 2016). Rereseting the frst revision studies (, Ferris 1997;Feris & Roberts, 201) found that most indirect wCF and content-related comments were successull implemented over subsequent/terminal drafts during revisions, although effcts over subsequent compositions were not gauged. Preceding them, a cluster of longitudinal studies (e.g., Semke, 1984; heppard, 1992) had found no significant difference in ccuracy development between WCF and content groups. Despite their longitudinal designs, criticisms of their methodological conundrums led researchers to design controlled focused wCF studies. Conducted within the cognitive perspectives of SLA, these studies suggested that because WCF targeting a single structure (e.g, Bitchener & Knoch, 2008) or two/three tructures (e.g., Bitchener, Young & Cameron, 2005) can contribute to higher accuracy and retention over time (Bitchener & Knoch, 2009), it is possble for learners to internalize and consolidate their explicit knowledge as a result of explicit information provided in written $\mathrm { C F " }$ (Bitchener, 2012, p. 353). Apart from subsequent conflicting results (Shintani, Ellis & Suzuki, 2014), the main criticism against focused WCF studies was their narrow wWCF scope, an atypical classroom practice, hence their low ecological validity (Liu & Brown, 2015).

Most participants in independent qualitative WCF studies appreciated the pedagogical value of feedback on language and content (e.g., Hedgcock & Lefkowitz, 1994; Manchon & Roca de Larios., 2011; Montgomery & Baker, 2007) and wCF (e.g., Diab, 2005; Ferris, Liu, Sinha & Senna, 2012; Hyland, 2003; Lee, 2005; McMartin-Millr, 2014), while in some studies (e.g., Ferris, 2018; Lee 2008), difficultie with decoding comments were also voiced. Other cognitive-driven studies explored the depth of WCF processing and found that factors such as wWCF scope, proficiency and duration of intervention contribute to deep processing. While some found evidence for indirect wCF to promote such depth (e.g, Caras, 2019; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2012), others found direct wCF more effective (e., Cerezo, Manchon & Nicolas-Conesa, 2019; Park & Kim, 2019).

Later unfocused wCF studies (e.g., Bonilla Lopez et al., 2018; Bonilla Lopez Steendam & Buyse, 2017; Hartshorn et al., 2010; Van Beuningen et al., 2012) highlighted wCF efectiveness. Bonill Lopez et al. (2018) demonstrated the eficacy of four unfocused WCF conditions on writing acuracy with an advantage for direct wCF given the participants' lower proficiency. Using an equal-weight QUAN QUAL design, Bonilla Lopez et al. (2017) found that both lower- and higher-proficiency students benefited from unfocused WCF confired its instrumentalit and succed n modfying eoneous structures. Other studies ., Chander, 2003; Ferris, 2006, Hartshorn et al., 2010; Rahimi, 2021) found interactions between (overall) accuracy and substantial writing, wCF processing and rewriting. Soliciting feedback preferences for triangulation purposes, Chander (2003) concluded that her students found direct WCF and underlining most instrumental. However, most follow-up longitudinal wCF studies, as in Chandler's and Semke's (1984), have been confined to feedback attitudes toward specific aspects of writing, what Riazi and Candlin (2014) delineate as a QUAN qual design, which underlines quantitative findings. In particular, few longitudinal mixed-methods studies have investigated dimensions of proceduralization to enlighten L2 development from the erspectives of the same L2 writers. There is adearth of follow-up qualitative studies for the purposes of complementarity, aiming to solicit in-depth explanation of the phenomena involved, i.e, how students employ direct WCF to decode the underpinning directive of feedback points and utilize it in subsequent output.

Other perception wCF studies have also discussed findings in light of SLA frameworks. Informed by the sociocultural theory, Aljafreh and Lantolf (1994) explored the effct of WCF negotiations by other-regulation on L2 development. Five levels of transition were identified in lower-proficiency participants development toward self-regulation: failure to notice the gap; noticing but failure to amend; noticing and amending under other-regulation; noticing and self-correction with minimal/zero feedback; and consistently generating error-free text. Informed by the noticing hypothesis, Qi and Lapkin (2001) investigated gap noticing in a single writing episode, where two students compared their output with teacher reformulations prior to rewriting. They concluded that noticing facilitated by reformulations contributed to L2 writing mprovement, especiall for high-proficiency learners. Manchon and Roca de Larios. (2011), however, explained how higher-proficiency students started to value practicing the language learned whil processing feedback on language, content and organization thanks to a nine-month engagement with multilateral feedack. Similarly, Rastgou (2022) found that L2 writers dramatically broadened their perspectives concening accuracy, fluency,content and organization after ten wees of engagement with feedback. Hyland (2011), to, found that her six participants underlined the gradualnessof L2 learning through feedback and affirmed the problem-solving quality of indirect WCF and their metalinguistic development.

The current qualitative phase of a mixed-methods study, however, explored how L2 writers expanded and retained their lingustic knowledge ater te weeks of wring and engagment with direct w.ts purose was complementrit, ..to illustrate reults from the quantitative phase to propose "a more complete and elaborated understanding of layers or segments of the phenomenon under study" (Greene et al., 1989, cited in Riazi & Candin, 2014, p. 154). It aimed to investigate \*the very nature of, and the variables mediating, the language learning potential of written output practice" during writing and feedback processing, which "should prove valuable in the fields of both writig research and second language acquisition, thus serving as  theoretical and pedagogical interface between these two fields of inquiry" (Manchon, 2011b, p. 77). Leow and Manchon (2022) again reiterated the need to explore the processing depth of salient and complex errors during the composing/revising proceses. Informed by the theoretical and empirical discussions and the quantitative findings summarized below, the objectives of this study are operationalized as the following research questions from the L2 writers' perspectives:

1. How does consistent engagement in writing, processing direct wCF and rewriting lead to the modification and consolidation of what low- to mid-intermediate L2 writers have already internalized?   
2. What challenges do the L2 writers engaged with sustained direct wCF encounter during knowledge modification, and to what extent do their strategies facilitate knowledge modification and consolidation?   
3. What are the outcomes of selfinitiated error correction or exclusive engagement with feedback on content and organization regarding linguistic development?

To inform the RQs, first the quantitative findings mainly related to accuracy are recapitulated.

# 4. The quantitative phase (Rastgou et al., 2020)

Data were primarily collected in a large private English school i Iran over three consecutive summer terms from those students enrolled in Terms 8-13, classfied as low- to mid-intermediate based on placement tes and error type and frequency (ACTFL, 2012). Each summer month, students attended a term of 22 eighty-minute sessions and entered the next upon obtaining a passing score of $7 0 \%$ Ninety-two students (63 female and 29 male), allspeakers of Persian, participated in weekly writing classes and wrote atotal of ten compositions. The participants were novice writers since this was their frs 2 composition writing experience, as in Bonill Lopez et al.'s (2018) study. Their ages ranged from 14 to 33 years with the mean age of 20.6 years.

The study investigated whether the four groups of L2 writers improved in accuracy, fluency, content and organization. They were engaged with direct WCF (WCF Group, $\mathbf { n } = 2 5$ ; feedback on content/organization (COR Group, $\mathbf { n } = \mathbf { 1 9 }$ ); multilateral feedback (WCF plus feedback on content/organization) (MUL Group, $\mathbf { n } = 2 6$ ); and self-correction (no feedback) (NOF Group, ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 2 2 { \mathfrak { n } }$ . The students wrote ten 200/250-word expository compositions (e.g., on face-to-face communication) within 30-45 minutes and rewrote eight (Scripts 2-9, henceforth s2, s3, etc.). Given error frequency associated with lower-proficiency students, the target structures incorporated an extended number of features, including tense, voice, word form, prepositions, subject-verb agrement, plurality, articles, pronouns, and possessve adjectives, yet excluded other categories to avoid overwhelming students with inordinate correction. Grammatical accuracy was measured using the percentage of error-free clauses (EFC) and the number of errors per 100 words (EP100w) at Week 1 (Time 1, pre-test), Week 10 (Time 2, post-test) and Week 14 (Time 3, delayed post-test).

The two-way repeated measures ANOVA results showed that only those groups engaged with CF (WCF and MUL) significantly improved in grammatical accuracy from Time 1 to 2, which they retained at Time 3, approximately all with medium to large effct sizes. The WCF group increased their percentage of EFC with a large effect size at Time 2 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 9 5$ ) and medium at Time 3 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 7 6$ ) and reduced their EP100w at Times 2 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 9 8$ ) and 3 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 6 7 $ ). Likewise, the MUL group improved in EFC at Times 2 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 4 6$ ) and 3 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 7 0 $ ) and reduced EP100w at Time 2 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 7 0 $ ) and 3 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 6 6$ . In comparison, the percentage of EFC in the COR group dropped, but not significantly, at both times although their EP100w declined over Times 2 and 3, which proved significant at Time 3 (Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 1 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ). The NOF group made no significant changes at either time. Concerning other constructs, only the COR and MUL groups significantly improved in content, organization, and fluency (words per script).

# 5. Method

# 5.1. Current study: the qualitative phase

Given the pace required to report on the influence of four feedback conditions on four constructs at three imes, the qualitative findings were presented separately. Notwithstanding the findings above, this follow-up investigation aimed to explore what composing and feedack practices resulted in knowledge expansion and retention. In particular, as potential benefits of rewriting (e.g., deep processing) are often associated with indirect wCF (Caras, 2019), it explored how acting on direct wCF resulted i learning rules. Concerning knowledge modification, it explored whether and how, in light of direct wCF, rewriting triggered hypothes formation, reformulation and confirmation. Concerning knowledge consolidation, it explored the extent to which the students induced underlying rules of salient and complex categories to ultimately employ accurately and what strategies they employed to overcome potentil challenges. This proces could inform William's (2012) and Bitchener and Storch's (2016) conceptual frameworks of L2 development through L2 writing. Over 14 hours of semi-structured interviews with a cohort of 20 participants engendered text-specific explanations from individualized scripts to inform the study.

# 5.2. Participants and data collection procedure

Following completing the writing tasks in Week 10, the participants were asked to volunteer for a semi-structured interview in Week 11. Based on the interview protocol outlined below, five participants from each group were selected $( \mathrm { N } = 2 0$ ; 13 female and 7 male). The instruments included student compositions, feedback in three reatment groups, and interview transcripts. The compositions included ten Draft 1 (D1) and eight Draft 2 (D2) scripts. An interview protocol (PSPSP) was developed entailing five stages:

1. Portfolio. L2 writers need to keep their Draft 1/2 scripts in a personal folder as a reference for reviews, comparisons and future research purposes.   
2. Sampling. Interviewees are selected from volunteers representing both overachievers and underachievers, more/less enthusiastic participants, both genders, and all groups.   
3. Preparation. Interviewees should review their scripts prior to the interview and mark the segments that they want to raise in response to interview questions.   
4. Stimulated recall Interviewees need to bring their scripts t the interview. For each question, they support their perspectives using cues from scripts.   
5. Proof. Interpretations incorporate interviewees perception of reality (improvement, stagnation, challenges, etc.) in light of representative written output for verification.

The interview questions solicited participants perspectives about the number of compositions, recurring erors, rewriting proces, feedback eficacy, eack comprehensibilit, lerning through fack, and applyig indced rule. The adi-reordd interviews, administered in Persian, took between 23 and 72 minutes, an average of 42 minutes 55 seconds.

# 5.3. Data coding and analysis

Grounded theory (Strauss& Corbin, 1998) was employed for data coding and analysis where "the researchers should go beyond merely describing or categorizing the target phenomenon and should offer some basic understanding of the principles, relationships, causes and/or motives underlying it (Dornyei, 2007, p. 260). In the open coding stage, after reading the transcripts, broad categories were identified and coded. Then, fllowing Dornyei's (2007, p. 260) two governing questions ("What s this piece of data an example of?" and "What principles underlie these actions/statements"), the transcripts were carefullyscrutinized, and pertinent data were assigned corresponding numerical codes. The axial coding aimed to establish rationalistic interconnections between the themes and categorie, resulting in the emergence of finalized categories over the iterative process of reading and classification: number of compositions, number of eedback sesions, recurring errors (reasons and solutions), rewriting, metalinguistic fdback, (new) rule induction, and generalization beyond writing. Selective coding, as Dornyei agues, ams to identify a central category with a level of abstraction that can subsume other categories,attained by elaborating on memos and additional exploration of themes and categories, substantiated during axial coding. As will be discussed, theentral category (the proposed theory) in the current study is that 2 writers endeavor to induce rules underlying direct wCF to implement during independent written output production.

# 6. Results

The findings recapitulate and quote the participants' representative perspectives mainly about engagement/non-engagement with WCF. Pseudonyms were used to protect participants' anonymity.

# 6.1. Copious written output production: pedagogical and attitudinal benefits

RQ1 addressed how consistent engagement in the WR WCF RW process lead to knowledge modification and/or consolidation. When the students were asked whether writing ten and rewriting eight composition was adequate, the majority explained the need for more composition writing (e.g., 3-5 more; twice as many). Their rationale, in a nutshell, entailed engaging with feedback on new structure or aditional features, such as lexis, orthography and punctation, receiving WCF onnewly emerging errors,continuin trial and error, utilizing newly learned structures and vocabulary, coing with new linguisti hallenges, writing on novel topics, or simply learning more or having abundant writing practice. An emerging outcome of initiating engagement in writing for these irst-time L2 writers, rrespective of feedback, was growing confidence in writing competence after writing 1-5 compositions (overcoming the fear/stress of voicing ideas on paper in English", "without external resource in classroom").

# 6.2. Rewriting to learn

Sustained mandatory rewriting played a pivotal role in students progression toward modifying knowledge (RQ1). Students deemed rewriting an instrumental aset for learning, without which they would have paid littl attention to individualized feedback points, or as Noushin [WCF] noted, "we would have had only a glimpse at our script and then put it away".

(1) [Rewriting] could make me remember the points more efectively than when I only read them. I could notice them while reviewing ... but rewriting had longer-lasting effect. [Elham, MUL]

Many comments suggested that rewriting was regarded as an elaborate process per se involving considerable reflection, metacognition, and follow-ups. Sahar [COR] decribed the proces as reading comments, understanding, applying, thinking while rereading the original composition and writing a new composition.

(2) On the way home, I review it once. At home, I read it thoroughly and think about why I've made those mistakes, whether due to distraction or lack of knowledge; I rewrit it while using [the corrected forms]. I'm used to noting down some key points to follow up ater rewriting, or simultaneously, searching about them online, sometimes in my Interchange books, or in my dictionary. [Sorena, WCF]

A significant benefit of mandatory rewriting was a dramatic change in pedagogical orientation toward the entire WR WCF RW process.

(3) I got the main effect from rewriting because reading the comments was only a theoretical step. Rewriting enabled me to engage mentally. When I knew I had to rewrite, I was reading so to comprehend them. [Reza, COR]

The reconceptualization was even evident in the NOF students' practice. As Shiva stated, even without feedback, rewriting trig gered rereading the compositions to restructure poorly organized sections and rectify grammatical and orthographical errors.

6.3. From internalization to modification: positive washback effects of repeated engagement with WCF

Students' explanations implied that repeated writing practice, whereby the students constantly engaged with wCF on various structures, would lead to successful modification (RQ1). This progression was initiated by enhanced consciousnes toward error reduction, in general ("Even if I consider improvement in $6 0 { - } 8 0 \%$ of cases, it's a successful process.") and toward inaccurate categories, in particular ("larning that had some problems with voice, gerund, and prepositions" "When I may need to use "s" or "the' I will at least pause, and won't skip them from habit."). Many noted that repeated wCF tigered attention to complex features (e.g., word form, passive voice, article the, and morphological features) (e.g, using "sick vs. sckness and "admire vs. admirable") and sucessul amendment and learning of some of them. The message underpinning many feedback points became transparent only afte (re)writing several compositions: "Feedback can take two sessions for a person [to work] and five for another.".

(4) I have learnt to use passive voice correctly but it is certainly necessary to use whatever you learn. [Fatemeh, MUL] (5) I may not have fixed all the problems up to S9 but at least understood that for the next compositions I'd have such problems and need to pay more attention to them. [Elham, MUL]

(6) I had some knowledge about past and future voice but did not know how and when to use them correctly. When you changed "have been used" to "is used" in s2, I started to recollect my knowledge about voice and reduce such errors. I continued to use passive voice, but more accurately. [Alireza, WCF]

6.4. Positive washback effects of consistent WCF on recurring errors: L2 writers' pedagogical decisions

RQ2 explored potential challenges that L2 writers encountered while attempting to modify their linguistic knowledge and their prospectie strategies. A perceived challenge was the bulk of recurring errors repeatedly reminded to the WCF and MUL groups, who cited them as trivial or smallincluding s (third person, plural, apostrophe), a (atice), and -ed (past-tense marker). One student implied that small erors are small in size, hence les oservabl. tdents noted that such errors pested for a whiledue t atention lape or concentration on meaning, but not incompetence. A primary function of consistent WCF was reduction in recurring errors. Some students notd that consistent WCF raise their consciousness about such familiar errors, which led to erious elf-inspired decisions to avoid them.

(7) When you corrected one of my errors three times it meant that it was really an eror and must not be repeated. [Azam, WCF] (8) When I noticed so much feedback on $" s "$ , I thought it was time to fix this problem by taking care. I thought it was not difficult. Over my last scripts, I was accustomed to deciding whether to apply "s" or not. [Alireza, WCF]

When asked about expected actions against recurring errors, the students sugested the provision of consistent wCF, metalinguistic xplanation, indirect wCF, indirect ater direct wCF, or one/two wCF points followed by a"pay-attention" notificatio, but not lisregarding them.

(9) A mark would be enough to remind me of those mistakes.If left uncorrected, I would be confused about it accuracy. Massoud, WCF]

# 6.5. Hypothesis testing: a common practice during knowledge modification

The ${ \tt W R } {  } { \tt W C F } {  } { \tt R W }$ process led to a more reflective level of engagement: trial and error, a process-oriented strategy employed to decode the underlying rules of complex structures (RQ2). Sahar (COR), for instance, noted that, unconvinced with the teacher's comment on on the other hand, she used the cohesive device in several other places "to finll discover where it suits". Massoud explained the process in detail.

(10) Concerning "the',"a" and"an", in most cases I did not understand the reason for corrections; so over the next compositions kept making mistakes before I fairly understood why you were crossing them out. In S7, I used "a" before"countryside" based on the rule I had derived about using articles, which I then noticed was wrong. When you crossed out s" from "information" and "equipment", I guessed that the words do not require "s", but was never sure. [Massoud, WCF]

Elsewhere, Massoud concluded his comments about trial and error:

(11) I needed a few more esions] to be so automatic that even at times of fatigue I could write accurately. In many cases, I knowI will not make any more errors because I ultimately understood [the rules]. [Massoud, WCF]

6.6. Abstracting rules and consolidating knowledge: resolving ambiguity embedded in direct WCF

RQ1 also pursued how L2 writers employed wCF and (re)writing practice to consolidate their knowledge and implement it in independent texts. When the students were asked whether they were able to generalize any rules, numerous examples indicated that they wrote and rewrote to learn, i., they sought to induce rules governing thetarget structures through rereading wCF instances While employing them in the remaining compositions: 'Such practice resembles driving; after a while the rules will stick in our mind subconsciously.") "Later compositions made me establish what I'd learned." They atempted to derive the underlying rules (e.g., how to use verb $^ +$ verb, preposition $^ +$ verb, passive voice, and the definite article with its complex/versatile functions) through repeatedly examining wCF instances over the rewriting sessions.

(12) I found that after prepositions I hould use gerund and afer "to" infinitives. Probably in the beginning I did not know the reason and kept repeating the same error; but later when I reread the compositions and noticed repeated corrections, I understood the points. [Fatemeh, MUL]   
(13) I used singular pronouns to refer to "advertisements" and some other plural words, but the feedback showed me the use of pronouns depends on the [plurality or singularity of] the referent. [Sorena, WCF]   
(14) Repeated correction of "the" helped me learn the rule. [Noushin, WCF]   
(15) I learned to use "is" after "everybody". I remembered this in my last composition. [Nasrin, MUL]

Given the directness of wcF, the students might be superficially characterized as copiers of the corrected draft during revisions.

This, however, proved invalid for the students in the study, where the iteration of the WR direct WCF RW process reoriented their attention toward inducing rules, which was successful in most categories.

(16) In later compositions I was able to generalize rules related to plural and singular nouns, but not word form. [Azam, WCF]

Even failure to induce rules indicated endeavors through deep processing of WCF. Regarding RQ2,there were serious challenges hindering hypothes confirmation. Many students noted that the complexity of ertain grammatical features impeded rule abstraction (e.g, why "because" instead of if, why "can learn" instead of "can be learned" "I didn't know what tense I needed to express wish") which resulted in carbon-copying without understanding. Many found "the" a complex grammatical feature.

(17) Once you crossed out "the", which was important for me [to know] why; I thought about it but did not understand it,so I opied it and went on. [Amirali, MUL]   
(18) I remember the confusion between "affect" and "effect, which is still unsettled; I should memorize which one is a verb. [Fatemeh, MUL]

Several students suggested that the addition of metalinguistic explanations could simplify complex structures (e.g., on why to use "have", not "has"; when to use "on" afer "influence"; where to use "that" instead of "to", why not"five-years-old" why "the" is needed before "internet" why not health of them" and "tast of them" instead of "their health" or "their taste" "because food is inanimate as we learned at school").

(19) Despite [your reminder of] "the" before "internet" [in S5],I forgot to apply it in S8 and elsewhere. When I know the reason for something, it will stick in my mind. [Fatemeh, MUL]

There were others, though, who were satisfied with using specific functions without seeking reasons:

20) There were some points that I had not known about, like using "the" before internet", which I learned. [Rezvaneh, MUL]

Alireza's classfication of direct wCF somehow recapitulates different levels of engagement depending on rule complexity:

(21) I classfy feedack into three types: a) clear, [which I have] enough knowledge about, like have used" in S8 or the omission of "had" in had concentrated'". Because I had received similar feedback in S2, I could fully understand what it meant. b) Some problems were related to features I was familiar with, but was unaware of why I should have used them that way, e.g., in S9, "similar to making". I know that after "to" I should use a simple form; I did not know why you changed it to "making". c) Sometimes I had no idea of a problem, on which I needed a comment. [Alireza, wCF]

Furthermore, the WCF recipients were aware that some grammatical categories were disregarded and, given their abilit to reduce target errors over time, they preferred more comprehensive edback, , on lexical fetures ., sutaility of the words civilized" in S7 and "exceed" in s2; "argue" instead of "discuss", ppropriateness (I some cases, my whole sentence was suffering), orthography, punctuation, connectors or reformulation ("I expected reformulations of my faulty sentences. In some cases, I translated some ideas from Persian, which were not cose to the original nglish sentence). student described his experience  proces of requesting a teacher response which pushes him one step forward, concluding that "in the proces of language learning, we certainly cannot learn fast".

# 6.7. Knowledge use beyond L2 writing

Examples of using the newly learned knowledge while practicing other skill or reallife writing validated the consolidation of part of knowledge (RQ1),e.g, accurate use of "the" in speaking classes [Elham, MUL]. Elham noted that further writing practice enabled her to write her article better.

(22) The compositions helped me communicate more easily with some foreigners when I was doing atwo-week apprenticeship in the south. I used the experience to summarize a 3-4-page manual into half a page. [Sorena, WCF]   
(23) I no longer use [work] with"s" in my speaking or new written texts; the same with "information", whic I leaned is uncountable. [Fatemeh, MUL]   
Somewhere else Fatemeh noted her newly-developed metacognitive strategy during reading:   
(24) Now when I read even a story, ook for the inroduction in the beinning and conclusion at the end. I check whether allspecific information is located in one section.   
Shahrzad, who only received content/organization-related fedback, was also conscious of her errors during article writing:

(25) I've graduated with a master's degree; it helped me a lot with my article writing, which I am now involved in. My professor asked me to write it in English but I did not dare; [now] I've written a 14-page article; itis full of erors ut I dared to write it. started with an introduction; I wrote the advantages and disadvantages. [Shahrzad, COR]

# 6.8. Repercussions of excluding wCF from the WR WCF RW cycle

RQ3 inquired about the linguistic outcomes of self-initiated eor correction during rewriting (for the no-feedback group) or exclusive engagement with feedback on content and organization. In general, these students appreciated continued engagement in the WR and RW phases of the proces. Regarding linguistic benefits, both groups saw the prolonged (re)writing practice (rather) motivating and an opportunity for ril and error (using newly learned grammar elsewhere in wriing" "I wanted to change some grammar to use a more complex one, which challenged me"), self-initiated amendments (replacing a problematic sentence with another during rewriting), autonomy (consulting external resources), and for a few starting to modify language successully (I had learned [using gerund afte prepositions] before but simply ignored it. Gradually I began to writ more carefully). Their hypothesis teting, though remained mainly unresolved.

(26) Over the last compositions I used a grammatical structure Id recently leaned and Ithink it improved; but because you were not giving feedback, I was unsure which structure was used inaccurately. [Shima, NOF]

The majority expressed discontent with systematicll receiving no wWCF. When there was zero wCF, or as others noted, when the teacher disregarded some key features over time, they disregarded most grammatical aspects, copied erroneous segments, omitted unsettled sections in D2, or used less complex, "safer" structures, resulting in stagnation or minimal linguistic improvement.

(27) When I found that you did not mind the wrong tenses, I started using simple present tense, which was easier; I did not use present perfect or other tenses to keep it simple. [Shahrzad, COR]   
(28) Sometimes I knew my sentence was wrong and left uncorrected. I noticed the problematic sentence but could not fi it, so I totally excluded it in D2. [Azam, WCF]   
(29) Once [I noticed] I had an incorrect sentence in D1, which I wanted to fix at home but wasn't able to, so I copied the same sentence in D2. [Shima, NOF]

# 7. Discussion

RQ1 explored how L2 writers' consistent engagement in the WR WCF RW process facilitated the modification and consolidation of part/most of the knowledge that they had internalized. Fig 1 illustrates the synergistic interplay dynamics of such engagement, an interplay model of L2 writing for L2 delopment. A principal inding, specificall for lower-proficiency students, is the instrumentalit of consistent direct wcF for reflection on language, ongoing hypothesis reformulation toward rule abstraction and consolidation of linguistic knowledge and L2 development. As llustrated in Fig. 1, the process commences with the students composing D1 of a writing sample (WR1, wR2, ec.), the accuracy of which interacts with the frequency of it iteration, illustrated by the returning arrows $(  )$ to the WR domain. The second phase is teacher's fedback provision, which is inthis case direct WCF on various target structures (WCF on TS), as "information that invites learners' cognitive processing and decision making" (Yu, Yuan & Wu, 2023, p. 7).

![](img/0a9b33910fafac77fbc0033be539748c3cc26f4a01cbb61ed062515a3f37d434.jpg)  
Fig. 1. A representation of the cyclical interplay of writing, direct wCF processing and rewriting.

The third phase illustrates the RW domain, the rewriting-to-learn proces, involving students' behavioral engagement with feedback, i.e, how they revise their D1; affective engagement, ie, what atitudes they display toward wCF; and cognitive engagement, i.e., how they cope with wCF (Elli, 2010). When mandatory, rewriting commences with the L2 writers reading the feedback points and the corresponding D1 concomitantl. They might adopt either a local feedback processing strategy" if they simultaneously analyze te commented/corrcted sements of their output and the feedback iteratively or a"deep feedback processig stratey if they peruse the entire text this way (Bouwer & Dirkx, 2023, p.5). This triggers gap noticing (Stage 1 in Bitchener & Storch's model), and if comprehensibl (Stage 2), engages them with the targeted segment affectively and cognitively. However, the non-target erroneous structures may go unnoticed and simply get copied.

Importantly, when the L2 writers are aware of the iteration in the WR WCF RW process, their affective engagement may be reoriented from glimpsing at erors, or "perfunctory noticing", to"substantive noticing" (Qi & Lapkin, 2001, p. 291), reflecting Stage 3 of the model, i.e., hypothesis formulation and internalization. This reconceptualization incorporates cyclical reading aimed at understanding a feedback point and its underlying rule, a reorientation which affords a didactic opportunity during the ${ \tt W R } {  } { \tt W C F } {  } { \tt R W }$ process,far beyond mechanically replacing eroneous segments with corrctions. imilarly Xu (2022) found that L2 writers growth mindsets enhanced their WCF-seeking orientation and (meta)cognitive and motivational regulation strategies. Another function of affective engagement for lower-level students may emerge after a couple of WR WCF RW episodes: reaching a decision-making stage to tackle recurring, minor erors (e.g, s, a, an), which are salient but not complex. Most students are aware of their associated grammatical rules but may apply them inaccurately due to attention lapse during negotiating meaning. Persisting feedback signals that a decision/action must be taken against slient errors, which, as suggested, could be facilitated by an attention-grabbing note informing students of error recurrence.

On the other hand, cognitive engagement with wCF "requires students to employ cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies to evaluate feedback on their writing and monitor thir revisions" (Zhang & Hyland, 2022, p. 14). This requires deep processing of WCF involving attempts to abstract the rules which govern correcte structure, followed by hypothesis testing, i.., applyig the induced rules in the next WR phase, a feasible cognitive strategy, thanks to the prolonged processing time during writing (Manchon, 2011a; 2011b; Williams, 2012). The iterative WR WCF RW process enables L2 writers to repeatedly check their attempted hypotheses, relinquish wrongly formulated ones, reformulat new ones (Stage 4), construct sentences based on them (Stage 5), and reappraise them through subsequent WCF. Upon the iteration of this proces, most salient and some complex errors tend to diminish and the targeted linguistic knowledge is consolidated.

The language learning potential of rewriting has bn confirmed in other studies (e.., Bonilla Lopez et al., 2018; Manchon, 2011b; Rastgou, 2022; Shintani et l., 2014). Consistent mandated rewriting dramatically changes L2 writers' orientation from a superficial glimpse at Draft 1 to a process, whereby L2 writer cyclically read corrected segments and their corresponding text for profound processing of errors and direct wCF, which graduall facilitates the long-term storage and easier retrieval of the acquired knowledge. As a result of L2 writers reinforced consciousness, this iterative process will enhance accuracy in subsequent written productions, including other genres (email, summaries, etc.) and is conducive to accurate use in domains beyond writing, such as oral production. Future interface studies need to further explore the conduciveness of consolidated knowledge to speaking to provide evidence for the extent to which knowledge, initially instigated through L2 writing practice can become automatized and used independently. As wil be discussed, however, this process is not without obstacles which can decelerate knowledge modification.

RQ2 explored what cognitive challnges the L2 writers encountered whil striving to induce linguistic rules embedded in more complicated wCF and the extent to which they were resolved. A close scrutiny of comments suggested that despite attempts to process direct WCF points, they did not always sucd in grasping their underlying rule. In fact, some grammatical features are too complex for some students although less complex for their peers) because of their functional variability (e.g., the), lower frequency (e., omission of "s in compound adjectie), or specific rule application (e.g, affect on vs. efect on). In other words, in the same grammatical category, different rules may be applied (Rastgou, 2023), some of which may not be induced by students with lower metalinguistic information even with a high depth of processing, directness of WCF and iteration in different contexts.

Other grammatical categories, where one function (e.g., ffixation) may have various forms, cannot be acquired afer a limited number of feedback sessions and through one feedback mode. For instance, crossing "success and adding "sucesfu" may not immediately translate into accuracy in another word form eg., hard" instead of"hardly") elsewhere. This i eause of high versatility of the morphological processes involving suffixation, which hinders generalizability, i.e, the transferability of a couple of feedback instances toaccurate use in another context, in comparison with generalizable cateorie (., possessive adjetives). Deeyser (2007) argues that consistent engagement is required for declarative knowledge to convert into procedural knowledge, where the L2 learner makes numerous trial-and-error attempts before the knowledge i consolidated. However, even and only through extended writig opportunities L2 writers may not succeed in accurate application of certain complex structures, finding noted in Liu and Brown's (2015) meta-analysis. Apparently, engaging students in more than one feeback mode facilitates successful processing of wCF on complex structures, uptake and knowledge modification. Park and Kim (2019), for instance, sugested that err labeling be added to underlining to promote deeper processing of errors. Additional student-friendly feedback strategies may include underlining to remind, for instance, the use of a plural marker, adding a metalinguistic explanation for alesfrequent structure, such as "similar to $^ +$ gerund', reformulating an awkward sentence or bracketing it and requesting rewriting, or classrom conferencing for a common error (possessve marker "of' vs. "apostrophe s"), which can mitigate processing complex wCr. Otherwise, students may simply copy verified amendments in Draft 2 without understanding essential for knowledge modification.

In terms of hypothesis confirmation concerning structures perceived to be les complex (e.g., tense, verb form, pronoun referents, uncountable nouns, and for some, passve voice and the definte article), students tend to employ acognitive strategy investig on thir awareness of the continuity of WCF intervention. When a couple of WCF instances do not result in rule induction, students may temporarily postpone induction and instead seek a collction of other wCF instances of the same category documented in their previous or subsequent compositions, hoping to extrapolate a converging rule underlying all the instances. This finding corroborates what Bitchener and Storch (2016) call storing, Stage 4 in their theoretical framework. It also corroborates empirical findings (e.g., Leenknecht, Hompus & van der Schaf, 2019), where students read feedack instances and compared them against similar instances in previous essays to pursue shared rules. Goldstein (2004) maintained that students may overlook an incomprehensible comment or indirect WCF point, while this purported disregard might be a metacognitive strategy to proces similar instances elsewhere, which can ultimately mitigate the complexity of an upcoming WCF instance and lead to hypothesis confirmation and ultimately consolidation. In this process, each WR WCF RW episode builds on the previous one and feeds forward the next.

On the other hand, repeated encounters with wCF on salient errors (e.g., third-person, plural or apostrophe s; indefinite articles possessive adjectives; pronouns) and simpler structures (e.g., verb $^ +$ verb; preposition $^ +$ gerund; indefinite pronoun $^ +$ singular verb) substantially contribute to eror reduction. Sustained wCF on such rrors can leadto affective/cognitive engagement with feedack, i. e., a decision made by many L2 writers to pay conscious atention to accurate application in new WR phases based on their already established hypotheses. This informs how consistent WCF influences the WR phase. Metalinguisically aware of and determined to use familiar structures accuratel, the students tend to pause where errors typically recur at the WR phase, review the metalinguistic knowledge gained/repeatedly reminded, and apply the rule. Alternatively, they may produce a segment and then check it to amend possible errors (eg, add, delet or modify inflectional morphemes). This facilitates substantial reduction in salient erors for most students and a portion of fairly complex errors for some. This finding also informs Bitchener and Storch's (2016) model by difer entiating how attention works during the written output production phase and the input (WCF) processing phase.

In a nutshell, students engaged in a consistent WR WCF RW process do not merely glimpse at and copy direct wCF with various degree f complexity, a finding which contrdicts Caras (2019) position about th falure of direct wCF in promoting deep processing of target tructures. The fact that students presented numerous text-specific examples and explanations about the complexity of certain grammatical features and attempted to abstract underlying rules suggests deep processing of direct wCF. In this proces, they read, sometimes repeatedly, the entire segment which the direct WCF addreses along with the wCF itself aiming to learn/review the underlying rule and acquire the abilit toapply the rule independently. This finding extends on those in Manchon and Roca De Larios (2011) study by arguing that while feedback processing through rewriting a limited number of compositions can trigger hypothesis formulation about how certain grammatical structures work, testing (attempting, rejecting, reformulating, confirming and extending) those hypotheses requires repeated engagements in the WR WCF RW process given the complexity and functional versatility of coexisting linguistic features. The reason why in BonillaLopez et al.'s (2017, 2018) studies the participants significantly improved in accuracy despite limited engagement in the WR WCF RW process was, as the authors maintained, their participants' high metalinguistic knowledge. An implication of the finding isthat lower-proficiency students with modest metalinguistic knowledge cannot be expected to accurately employ various grammatical categories after limited engagement in the $W { \mathrm { R } } {  } W { \mathrm { C F } } {  } \mathrm { R W }$ process. As regards WCF type, the findings do not concur with Bitchener and Storch's (2016) model, p. 18 ssumption that direct WCF may not benefit L2 writers who have partiall acquired aparticular form/structure and really need more explanation and practice in hypothessing and producing the correct form/structure themselves so that they can consolidate their knowledge and aes it more automatically over time".

Theoretically, the study substantiates Manchon's (2011a, pp. 57-58) SLA-oriented position that "feedback for acquisitin" ., "feedback aimed at promoting learning understood as either the consolidation or the expansion of linguistic resources" requires, amongst other vriables, "an itrative proces f writing, input/fback, notcing/reflection, and nw utut" ad ads that rflection is triggered through consistent mandatory rewriting. Concerning the type of knowledge consolidated, in line with the weak interface model (Ellis 2005), which predicts conditional conversion of explicit to implicit knowledge, it can be hypothesized that multiple episodes of(re)writing, which facilitates reflection on various WCF instances, considerably expand  writrs explicit knowledge, part of which might be converted into implicit knowledge (Manchon & Roca De Larios, 2011). Other studies (e.g., Chander, 2003; Hartshorn et al., 2010; Manchon & Roca De Larios, 2011; Rahimi, 2021), where students wrote either numerous or lengthy compo. sitions, have verified the language learning potential of student engagement in prolonged, meaning-driven practice. Table 1 summarizes the pedagogical outcomes of L2 writers' consistent engagement in the WR WCF RW process, which gradually emerge in the independent writing phase (wR) of the process.

RQ3 explored the extent to which systematic self-correction of linguistic errors, minus WCF $\mathrm { W } R {  } \mathrm { R W }$ , led to L2 development. Drawing on the findings, Fig. 2illustrates the process that L2 writers undergo when they are regularl requested to self-correct their compositions.

Fig. 2. A representation of the ramifications of the WR RW process, devoid of wCF.

As the model displays, the lower-level 2 writers may notice some of their linguistic erors during self-correction, which may lead to successful amendments provided that they have adequate linguistc knowledge aout the identified erors or sucesully consult external resources (., websites and books.Effective exploitation of external resources, hence elf-corrction, may also beaccomplished by having only partial knowledge about a noticed error, ccasionally resulting in knowledge modification. However, due to the restricted linguistic competence of lower-proficiency students, they might fail to rectify notice erors, or their decisions may result in erroneous alterations - new errors. As the students reported, even a successful but unverified self-correction is barely conducive to learning because of their uncertainty about it accuracy. Moreover, noticing without adequate linguistic knowledge about n accurate form instigates other repercussions, including deleting the entire sement or copying errors. Identifing errors without sucessul amendments prior to other-regulation was also noted by Aljafreh and Lantolf (1994). Desperate copying of errors also ocurs when errors either go unnoticed due to linguistic incompetence or when they are disregarded due to engagement with other feedback (e., on content or organization) (Rastgou, 2022). The pedagogical outcomes of lower-proficiency L2 writers' engagement in the ${ \tt W R }  { \tt R W }$ process during the WR phase are marginal. Although L2 writers continue to reformulate and enact hypotheses during writing and review them during rewritig, such attempts barely lead to rule abstraction as no reliable intermediary evaluates their hypothesis quality. This confines the definition of WR to an unverified written output production workspace, barely indicative of knowledge consolidation for many L2 writers.

# 8. Limitations and future studies

The current study solicited the perspectives of $2 0 ~ \mathrm { L 2 }$ writers engaged with differential feedback/no-feedback conditions for ten weeks but presented mainly WCF-related findings. Therefore, a covert onstraint inexorably manifested in the proposed model is the exclusion of multilateral feedback, which might imply that written feedack equates wCF. Theoreticall, an overarching interplay model of L2 writing $( \mathrm { W R } {  } \mathrm { F } {  } \mathrm { R W } _ { . }$ ) needs to incorporate all aspects of feedback (F), including content, organization, lexis and mechanics, thereby showcasing a comprehensive picture of L2 development and further autonomy from the already established models of L2 development/SLA (see Harklau, 2002 and Ortega, 2012, for a discussion of the literacy-SLA interface). In Bitchener and Storch's model, outut can be revisited to haracterize the cognitive/affctive rocesses which lead to the gneration of modified outut (RW) as distinguished from new output (WR).

The interplay model proposed here might need adjustments if future studies explore proceduralization in alternative proficiency and feedback conditions, e.g., those with multiple rewriting sessions, as in Ferris (2006) and Hartshorn et al.'s (2010) studies. Pre dictably, storing (the processfrom hypothesis reection to reformulation and confirmation) could take shorter for higher-proficiency students unless aditional complex structures are incorporated. Altenatively, storing indirect WCF may resemblestoring processes in the current study if wCF is ofered to lower-proficiency students over time. These hypotheses are open to scrutiny in future research. Methodologically, apart from triangulation, complementarity needs to be the target of future mixed-methods studies to probe various layers of the learning process through L2 writing. Empiriclly, if implementing weekly (rewriting/eedback iterations is unfeasible, the WR WCF RW process or the overarching WR $\scriptstyle \longmapsto \mathbf { F }  \mathbf { F }$ W process can be spread over longer interventions (e.g., two semesters) to moderate time and other constraint. Concerning target structure, an incremental policy can be adopted when L2 writers demonstrate significant error reduction, with wCF addressing other categories, e.g., word order (as in Rahimi, 2021) or nongrammatical errors (as in Bonill Lopez et al., 2018), a more ecologically valid feedback policy. In terms of the WR RW process that proved ineffective, future studies may entail trategy traning by instructing students to employ online resources for autonomous slf-initiated corrections.

# 9. Conclusion

Having elicited students' perspectives about the cognitive and pedagogical overtones of direct wCF, the current study demonstrated how consistent engagement in L2 (re)writing and WCF processing contribute to knowledge modification and consolidation. In an extended number of writing/feedback/rewriting sessions, an extended feedback scope roughly tailored to students' proficiency levels is justified. The cyclical interplay model, proposed here, has markedly drawn on the current SLA perspectives (Bitchener & Storch, 2016; DeKeyser, 2007) for their cognitive explanation of the departure from declarative to automatic knowledge. Notwith. standing, the model demonstrates the writing-specific processes of L2 development, diverging from those of L2 oral production. A central manifestation of this modular discrepancy is seen in the RW domain of the process, where L2 writers rewrite to learn, i.e, consult their portfolio, linguistically categorize and reflect on fedback instances, gradually expand their linguistic repertoire and abstract rules through hypothesis testing. Future empirical studies need to be mediated by other aspects of L2 writing, including genre, proficiency, feedack quality, and the influence of L2 writing beyond written tass in order to build a comprehensive writing theory of second language, one which is informed by processes characteristic of written output production.
