This paper presents a systematic analysis of ten first-year university learners' texts. The texts are exposition essays written at the conclusion of the students' first semester of university study and collected as part of the Macquarie University Longitudinal Learner Corpus (MQLLC). The MQLLC is a longitudinal corpus that follows learners from their first year Academic Communication (AC) unit throughout their tertiary careers. These units are taught using a scaffolded, genre-based pedagogy, with explicit instruction of the linguistic resources necessary to navigate the diverse and increasingly specialised demands of tertiary study (Rothery & Stenglin, 1995). As part of a larger study into academic literacy development, this small-scale study focuses on learner deployment of grammatical metaphor, a key linguistic resource for achieving the lexical density, text cohesion and condensation valued in academic discourse (Halliday, 1993, 1998; Hyland, 2009; Martin, 1993, 2008; Schleppegrell, 2001; 2004). Specifically, this paper seeks to identify how high performing learners' deployment of grammatical metaphor differs from that of low performing students to elucidate which patterns distinguish success. The paper concludes with pedagogical recommendations for ensuring learners effectively deploy this valuable resource.

# 1. Introduction

The study of academic discourse, or the language of the academy, is central to the development of academic literacy as it models the diverse linguistic patterns valued in educational contexts, particularly that of tertiary institutions. A primary distinction of academic discourse is the shift in the register and mode from that of everyday, informal, interactions toward more specialised, formal, written exchanges (Candlin & Hyland, 1999; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Rothery & Stenglin, 1995; Schleppegrell, 2001). In general, academic, written language is characterised as more lexically dense and authoritative, foregrounding events existing in cause and effect networks (Hyland, 2009, p. 7). Such language is a shift away from informal, everyday spoken language characterised by dynamic actions realised by mostly human actors, or participants, through processes.1 Academic discourse requires these dynamic processes to be reconstrued as static, synoptic entities systematically organised to enable comparison, contrast and evaluation (Martin, 1993; Schleppegrell, 2004).

As learners navigate the spectrum of genres and registers required in higher education, they are expected to develop and appropriately select the linguistic resources necessary to participate successfully in these discourse communities. Over the past three decades, SFL research has been particularly interested in the study of these advanced linguistic patterns, revealing significant insights into learners' ontogenetic development. Schleppegrell's (2001) seminal study on the language of schooling succinctly encapsulates commonalities found across a broad range of SFL research into school-based registers:

Using lexicalized and expanded noun phrases, marking discourse structure with linguistic elements that are typical of written academic discourse, and choosing grammatical features that project an authoritative stance are features that are pervasive in school-based registers. (p. 434)

Across the research, one linguistic resource is consistently identified as a critical tool for achieving these academic features, that of grammatical metaphor (GM hereafter).

Halliday (1993) identifies the emergence of GM as representative of the move from concrete, congruent interactions to abstract, incongruent or ‘metaphorical’ ones.2 For example, the congruent process, to be able to, can be reconstrued as a metaphorical Thing, ability. Ability can now be characterised (e.g., improved ability, extraordinary abilities, etc.) or even classified according to specialised fields (e.g., athletic abilities, technological ability, etc.), expanding the possible messages that can be expressed. This development is characterised by a tension between the strata of the lexico-grammar and the discourse semantics. This stratal tension enables writers to mean more than one thing at once, essentially extending the meaning potential of the language (Martin, 2008, p. 803). The former mode of congruent, concrete language is characteristic of spoken discourses in which ‘happenings’ are transitory and highly dependent on the interaction with the interlocutor and the context. The latter mode of incongruent abstraction construes these ‘happenings’ as fixed, synoptic entities, adapted for recording in the written mode (Halliday, 1979, 1998). This shift toward stable, fixed phenomena allows information to be organised systematically, categorised, commented on and evaluated, promoting the flow of information through a creation of “a new kind of knowledge: scientific knowledge; and a new way of learning” (Halliday, 1993, p. 131).

# 2. The study

Systemic Functional Linguistics research has identified GM as a central feature of academic registers and mapped its emergence in first language users of English (e.g., Christie, 2002; Christie & Derewianka, 2008; Derewianka, 1995; 2003; Painter, 1999; 2003; Ravelli, 2003) second and foreign language learners of English (e.g., Chen & Foley, 2004; Liardet,  2013a; 2015; Schleppegrell, 2004; Wang, 2010), and learners of other languages (e.g., Byrnes, 2009; Colombi, 2002; 2006; Ryshina-Pankova, 2010). However, many of these studies focus on instances of GM as contributory to academic success rather than exploring the quality and impact of the GM on the construction of academic expression. Liardet's (2013b)  study, however, elaborates the theoretical framework for analysing GM deployment to account for the impact or effect that the GM has on the construction of academically valued texts: textual impact (also referred to as logogenetic impact).

The present study employs Liardet's (2013b, 2014)  elaborated theoretical framework for mapping GM proficiency in learner texts to analyse ten first-year university student texts at an Australian university. The learners are participants in the Macquarie Longitudinal Learner Corpus (MQLLC), a longitudinal corpus of university student assignments collected across participants' university careers. The MQLLC recruits students during their first year of university study through their enrolment in one of the university's “Academic Communication” (AC) units. The AC units at Macquarie University are uniquely classified as “People” units, available to students across the faculties and qualifying as an elective ‘core unit’. People units are intended to broaden students' understanding of global challenges and issues, developing learners' socio-cultural literacy through a focus on social inclusion (Macquarie University Handbook, 2015). The ten students selected for this analysis were enrolled in Academic Communication for Business and Economics (ACBE), a unit focused on developing both academic and professional business discourse.

The AC units at Macquarie University employ a genre-based pedagogy with explicit instruction of GM and its impact on the semiotic reorganisation of academic texts. Throughout the semester, students collaborate with classmates to research a social inclusion issue (e.g., refugee resettlement, financial services for the poor, income gender inequality, etc.) and scaffold their literacy skills through reports, explanations and persuasive texts. The texts analysed in this study are the final argument essay required in the AC unit. The ten learners analysed here represent both English as a First Language (L1) and English as an Additional Language (EAL) students. These ten texts can be further classified according to the level of success on this final assignment; five texts were successful, achieving High Distinction and Distinction marks (i.e., $7 5 \%$ and above), while the other five texts were less successful, achieving Pass and Fail marks (i.e., $6 4 \%$ and below). For purposes of comparison, three of the students in each designation are English L1 learners and two are EAL learners; Table 1 below outlines the learners by language background and category of success.

In addition to evaluating the content of the argument essays, the marking criteria assess several academic writing skills (i.e., clause-level grammar, genre staging patterns and referencing) as well as academic expression (e.g., lexical density, objective evaluation, cohesion). Notably, the papers are marked by AC unit tutors (i.e., not the researcher) and the high and low score distinctions are determined without any review or linguistic analysis of the students' use of GM. For purposes of scope, the present study will focus only on learners' deployment of experiential GM and evaluate how it may contribute to learners' success on the assignment.3

a These identification codes are used to protect participants' anonymity and to distinguish learners' language background.

This examination of GM deployment first focuses on frequency and variation, analysing the prevalence and diversity of GM use. Significantly, much of the research into experiential GM focuses only on patterns of nominalisation (i.e., process or Quality as Thing); however, the present study will analyse four distinct patterns of experiential reconstrual, as outlined in Table 2.

While the prevalence and variety of GMs in student texts provide some insight into the degree of lexical density and text condensation achieved, these instances often occur in isolation and contribute little to the overall cohesion of the text. For example, in the excerpt from Text 0437 below, four experiential GMs (INTERESTS, CONSTRUCTION, APPROVAL, and LENIENCY) are deployed with one logical GM (TO ALLOW). However, each GM occurs in isolation, contributing little to the overall text cohesion.

groups with vested INTERESTS such as the CONSTRUCTION industry are leading the charge and voicing their APPROVAL TO ALLOW more LENIENCY around this issue. (0437-EN-LOW)

To qualify the GM's impact on the text and measure how effectively they contribute to text cohesion and argument development, Liardet (2013a, 2013b, 2014)  developed a framework of textual impact analysis (i.e. ‘logogenetic impact’). Of particular relevance here are the tools of anaphoric reconstrual, nominal group elaboration, and cause and effect metaphorical networks.

The first measure, anaphoric reconstrual (i.e., similar to ‘compacting’, MacDonald, 1994; ‘chain of reasoning’, Unsworth, 1997, p. 201; ‘retrospective labeling’, Charles, 2003), refers to the deployment of GMs in a congruent to incongruent and vice versa pattern across larger stretches of text. In other words, a congruent process or Quality occurs in the text and is then repackaged in its incongruent form, typically placed in Theme position of the subsequent clause to create a Given-New prosody (Halliday, 1994). To illustrate this effect, in the example sentences below, the congruent processes, affects and is condensed, are repackaged into the Things, EFFECTS and CONDENSATION to form the lexically dense nominal group (i.e., these CONDENSATION EFFECTS) functioning as the Theme of the subsequent sentence.

When GM is used appropriately, it affects the way language is condensed within the text. These CONDENSATION EFFECTS contribute to the succinct EXPRESSION of the students' message. [i]4

Halliday (1988) further explains this effect: “where the Theme is also Given, and thus typically refers to something that has gone before, it performs a powerful cohesive function in a text: ‘you remember what I said just now? ewell we're going to move on from there’” (p. 168).

The second textual impact indicator is elaborated nominal groups (Liardet, 2013b , pp. 108e109). When writers reconstrue multiple co-occurring meanings simultaneously, these meanings can be condensed into a single nominal group, allowing for an extended explanation of information (see also Vande Kopple, 1994; Wang, 2010, p. 33). For example, in the invented example above, both the processes, affects and condensed, are repackaged into a single elaborated nominal group, these CONDENSATION EFFECTS.

The third characterisation of textual impact, cause and effect metaphorical networks, involves an interaction between experiential and logical GMs (i.e., Relator as circumstance; e.g., because as DUE TO; Relator as process; e.g., because as LEADS TO, and Relator as participant; e.g., because as THE RESULT OF) to reconstrue a sequence into a figure, cohesively organising and building arguments through a series of cause and effect relationships. This is illustrated in the second sentence of the invented example above. The newly deployed metaphorical nominal group, these CONDENSATION EFFECTS, is related to the metaphorical nominal group, succinct COMMUNICATION of the students' message, through the logical GM, CONTRIBUTES TO. These cause and effect metaphorical networks are a key feature of academic discourse as they allow a text to structure information hierarchically to efficiently argue the text's purpose (see also Durst, 1984; Martin, 1989).

Table 2 Patterns of experiential GM reconstrual (Martin & Rose, 2003; 2008; Ravelli, 1988; 1999).   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Reconstrual pattern</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Process as thing (verb as noun)</td><td>contribute  cONTRIBUTION</td></tr><tr><td>Quality as thing (adjective as noun)</td><td>able &gt; ABILITY</td></tr><tr><td>Process as quality of thing (verb as adjective)</td><td>infect - INFECHIOUS</td></tr><tr><td>Quality of process as quality of thing (adverb as adjective)</td><td>quickly  RAPID</td></tr></table></body></html>

Congruent agnates are italicised. a Instances of experiential GM are annotated in bold, small capitals.

One exemplar of all three patterns of textual impact is found in the following excerpt from a high scoring text:

Furthermore, mobile BANKING enables financial PROVIDERS to identify BORROWERS and their credit histories by using improved technology. This EASE in IDENTIFICATION CAN RESULT IN a dramatic REDUCTION in the COST of financial INTERMEDIATION. (0409-NE-HIGH)

Anaphoric reconstrual is seen in the reorganisation of the congruent process to identify into the Theme-positioned GM, IDENTIFICATION. The meanings of enabling and using improved technology in the first sentence are then reorganised as EASE in the elaborated nominal group, this EASE in IDENTIFICATION. Finally, this EASE in IDENTIFICATION is organised into a metaphorical cause and effect network with the logical metaphor, can RESULT in, and the equally condensed and elaborated nominal group, a dramatic REDUCTION in the COST of financial INTERMEDIATION.

To provide a holistic picture of learners' deployment of incongruent meanings, this study will analyse all instances of experiential GM quantitatively, for frequency and variation, and qualitatively, for textual impact (i.e., anaphoric reconstrual, elaborated nominal groups and metaphorical cause and effect networks).

# 3. Findings

The ten texts analysed in this study are examined for instances of experiential GM. For purposes of scope, the quantitative findings will not detail the distinctions according to each pattern of experiential reconstrual (e.g., process as Thing, Quality as Thing, etc.), but will calculate how many different forms are deployed (i.e., variation; e.g., ACHIEVEMENT, ACHIEVABLE). The following sections first detail the quantitative analysis of GM frequency and variation before exploring the textual impact of these GMs on the development of academically valued texts (i.e., anaphoric reconstrual, elaborated nominal groups and metaphorical cause and effect networks).

# 3.1. Variation and frequency

The first stage of the integrated analysis identifies the different forms (i.e., variation) of GM deployed across the ten learners' texts and their frequency of deployment. To provide a context of word length, the learners' texts averaged 1110 words with the shortest text at 850 words and the longest text at 1349 words. Notably, the high scoring texts were ten per cent longer than the low scoring texts, as outlined in Table 3 below.5

Across these ten texts, a total of 358 different forms of experiential GM were identified with the low scoring texts deploying a total of 209 forms and the high scoring texts deploying 217 forms. As illustrated in Fig. 1 below, the high scoring texts demonstrate slightly higher variation, averaging 59.4 different forms of experiential GM per text, whereas the low scoring texts average 51.1 different forms.

Fig. 1. Experiential GM variation.   
Fig. 2. Experiential GM frequency of deployment (normalised per 100 words).

In terms of frequency, when normalised according to instances per 100 words, the high scoring texts deploy experiential GMs slightly more frequently than the low scoring texts (i.e., an average of 12 instances per 100 words as compared to 9.9 instances per 100 words, respectively), as illustrated in Fig. 2.

This slightly higher rate of experiential GM deployment offers little insight into the learners' overall success. However, when examined in relation to the overall lexical density of the texts, these numbers are more revealing. Lexical density can be measured in terms of the total number of words per clause and the number of experiential GMs per clause.6 On average, the low scoring texts have a higher number of clauses per text, demonstrating higher grammatical intricacy (i.e., 74.8 clauses per text as compared to 72 clauses). This intricacy is further highlighted in the lower number of words per clause (i.e., 14.1 words per clause compared to 16.2 words per clause) and the lower number of experiential GMs per clause (i.e., 1.4 compared to 2 experiential GM per clause), as outlined in Table 4.

Throughout the semester, students are taught the concept of lexical density and are encouraged to strive for lexically dense expression both through the deployment of GM and through the selection of concise synonymous language (e.g., ‘make sure to’ as ensure, ‘happens to be’ as is). This condensation of language simultaneously eliminates less valued, informal, superfluous language ‘fillers’ and allows for more information to be included within the word limit parameters.

# 3.2. Textual impact

While the quantitative analyses of GM deployment provide some insight into learners' familiarity with this resource, further examination of metaphorical patterns across sections of text reveals the effect of GM deployment on the text. Three key patterns of textual impactdanaphoric reconstrual, elaborated nominal groups and cause and effect metaphorical networksdare applied to the ten texts to identify any patterns associated more or less with successful academic writing (Liardet,  2013a, 2014).

# 3.2.1. Anaphoric reconstrual

Across the five low scoring texts, eleven instances of anaphoric reconstrual are identified in comparison to twenty-two occurrences in the high scoring texts. Apart from this distinction of prevalence, the low scoring texts demonstrate limited control over the reorganisation of congruent to incongruent meanings. For example, in the following excerpt, the Quality, lenient, is redeployed as the GM, LENIENCY. However, in the reconstrual process, the writer appears to confuse the argument, first supporting LENIENCY (i.e., ‘advocating their approval to allow more lenient entry’) and then opposing it (i.e., ‘the second argument is against LENIENCY’).

It is for the above reasons that it comes as no surprise that the CONSTRUCTION industry is advocating their APPROVAL TO ALLOW more lenient ENTRY for overseas TRAVELLERS through tourism, via asylum and REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT to enter Australian workforce … The second ARGUMENT is against LENIENCY toward a more open economy because there is no evidence to suggest a CORRELATION between allowing more people into the country and improving the ageing population. (0437-EN-LOW)

Notably, in the low scoring texts, none of the instances of anaphoric reconstrual achieve the Given-New prosody of situating the newly deployed GM in Theme position of the subsequent clause (i.e., it is located within the Rheme of the subsequent sentence). In contrast, the high scoring texts demonstrate greater proficiency and frequently achieve both anaphoric referencing and the Given-New prosody, as illustrated in the excerpts below.

time spent in travelling can also bar the poor's ACCESS to financial institutions. This BAR to accessing financial services can be eradicated by ACCESS to mobile BANKING … (0409-NE-HIGH)

positive REINFORCEMENT mechanisms such as rewarding those employers adhering to LEGISLATION is NECESSARY to incentivise EMPLOYERS to act accordingly, bridging the GPG. REWARDS and INCENTIVES include PREFERENTIAL ACCESS to government contracts or government FUNDING. (0416-EN-HIGH)

high-level public officers of other developing nations can simply adopt these models allowing for easier IMPLEMENTATION with minimal political hurdles. The ADOPTION of new vaccine technologies can have a tremendously positive IMPACT on vaccine SUPPLY and logistic systems (0423-EN-HIGH)

The first excerpt from Text 0409 demonstrates two consecutive anaphoric reconstruals, first of the process, bar, as the metaphor, BAR, and second of the embedded finite, to accessing financial services, as the GM, ACCESS to mobile BANKING. Similarly in the excerpts from Texts 0416 and 0423, the reconstrual of rewarding to REWARDS, incentivise to INCENTIVES and adopt to ADOPTION reposition the newly deployed GM in Theme position of the subsequent clause, achieving the added cohesive benefits of the Given-New prosody.

The referential and cohesive effects of anaphoric reconstrual are also achieved by first introducing the GM and unpacking its meanings across the text. For example, in the excerpt from the high scoring Text 0451, the GM, ERADICATION, is unpacked to the congruent meanings, to remove discrimination and to reduce the pay gap. Similarly, in Text 0423, the GM, the ADOPTION of new technologies, is unpacked in a subsequent sentence as, to adopt industry best practices.

Currently DISCRIMINATION in the workforce significantly deters the ERADICATION of the PAY gap as both men and women justify the gap. By providing ASSISTANCE to business owners and employees, the WGEA is able to remove DISCRIMINATION and therefore positively assist EMPLOYERS to reduce the PAY gap in the relevant industry. (0451-EN-HIGH)

regard will be had for the ADOPTION of new technologies that promise lower-COSTS and more reliable vaccine SUPPLY chains … even where OUTSOURCING is not an option, opportunities still remain for developing nations to adopt industry best PRACTICES from private enterprises (0423-EN-HIGH)

There are also a few instances of this ‘unpacking’ anaphoric reconstrual in the low scoring texts. In the excerpt from Text 0444, the metaphor, water REUSE, is unpacked as, re-using water, and in Text 0468, the metaphor, DETENTION, is unpacked as the congruent expression, locking them in an overcrowded, jail like detention centre.

water COLLECTION and REUSE remains a largely unexplored area that has yet to be utilised for this limited RESOURCE. With the world's fresh water being $1 \%$ of the total water on the planet, re-using water has yet to be fully assessed for VIABILITY and analysed for cost EFFECTIVENESS. (0444-EN-LOW)

Australia's MANDATORY DETENTION policy deter refugees by locking them in an overcrowded, jail like DETENTION centre (0468- DA-LOW)

Another feature of anaphoric reconstrual is the packing and unpacking of the GM across larger stretches of text as a type of referencing tool to reinforce a certain aspect of an argument. For example, in the excerpt from Text 0402, the process, access, is first deployed as the metaphorical Thing, ACCESSIBILITY, then as, ACCESS, and finally as the metaphorical Quality, ACCESSIBLE, weaving a texture of emphasis through this language play and repetition.

The second ARGUMENT for providing financial services to the poor in order to reduce POVERTY is by extending financial service ACCESSIBILITY through the technological INNOVATION of mobile FINANCING. Despite the global EFFORT to reduce POVERTY through PROVISION of microfinance, a large percentage of those in POVERTY do not have access7 to the SERVICES due to the rural areas they reside in where ACCESS to most SERVICES are seemingly difficult (Culpeper 2012, p.387). This factor CONTRIBUTES heavily TO the NEED to develop more easily ACCESSIBLE financial services for the poor (0402-MA-HIGH)

Notably, there is one example of this language play and repetition in a low scoring text through the reconstrual of the process, desalinate, as the Quality, DESALINATED, and the metaphorical Thing, DESALINATION.

capacity for producing DESALINATED water has increased since the 1980's … DESALINATION is expensive compared to conventional water TREATMENTS … Countries like Qatar and Kuwait that are water scarce rely $1 0 0 \%$ on DESALINATION for their water for domestic and industrial USES. (0444-EN-LOW)

Overall, while there are some examples of effective anaphoric reconstrual in the low scoring texts, these instances are rare and often overshadowed by incomplete control over the reconstrual. In contrast, the high scoring texts demonstrate greater control and flexibility over the deployment of experiential GMs in each of these anaphoric reconstrual patterns, often achieving the cohesive effects of the Given-New prosody.

# 3.2.2. Elaborated nominal groups

The second indicator of textual impact is the reconstrual and condensation of multiple experiential meanings into a single nominal group. Across the low scoring texts, there are twenty-six instances of elaborated nominal groups. However, similar to the occurrences of anaphoric reconstrual, these elaborated nominal groups often demonstrate intermediacy through inappropriate article and preposition use. For example, in the excerpts below, the articles ‘the’ and ‘a’ (i.e., the DEVELOPMENT, a LACK) are omitted from the elaborated nominal groups: DEVELOPMENT of PROTECTION, and LACK of EDUCATIONAL programs in developing countries.

There are three ARGUMENTS about DEVELOPMENT of PROTECTION for refugees to Australia (0418-KO-LOW)

insufficient FUNDING and LACK of EDUCATIONAL programs in developing countries is the greatest CONTRIBUTOR to the topical issue of vaccine DELIVERY. (0463-EN-LOW)

On other occasions, in an effort to condense the language, the elaborated nominal groups fail to communicate any clear meaning. For example, in the excerpt from Text 0418, the elaborated nominal group (i.e., the ABOLITION and cultural DIVERSITY and ethnic IDENTITY of DIVERSITY to the INTRODUCTION of multiculturalism policy) compacts and lists the meanings of five separate experiential GMs but fails to organise the language appropriately, creating a nonsensical construction. Similarly, in the excerpt from Text 0437, the elaborated nominal group (i.e., housing SHORTAGES and drastic IMPLICATIONS to the AVAILABILITY of GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT) compacts the meanings of short, imply, available, gain and employ into a single participant but fails to communicate a cohesive message.

Australia, while acknowledging the ABOLITION and cultural DIVERSITY and ethnic IDENTITY of DIVERSITY to the INTRODUCTION of multiculturalism policy in the early 1970s, the government officially became a multicultural society (0418-KO-LOW)

Allowing more people into the country will LEAD TO an OVERCROWDING effect, leaving the Australian POPULATION with housing SHORTAGES and drastic IMPLICATIONS to the AVAILABILITY of GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. (0437-EN-LOW)

Across the high scoring texts, there are fifty-six occurrences of elaborated nominal groups. In contrast to the low scoring texts, these instances mostly involve appropriately reconstrued experiential GM condensed into the participant. For example, in the excerpt from Text 0409, the meanings of reduce, cost, and intermediate are compacted into the nominal group, A dramatic REDUCTION in the COST of financial INTERMEDIATION. Similarly in the excerpts from Texts 0416 and 0423, the meanings of continue, employ, discriminate, introduce, power, refrigerate and supply are condensed into the nominal groups, The CONTINUANCE of EMPLOYER DISCRIMINATION, and The INTRODUCTION of solar-POWERED REFRIGERATION within vaccine SUPPLY cold chains.

This EASE in IDENTIFICATION CAN RESULT IN a dramatic REDUCTION in the COST of financial INTERMEDIATION (0409-NE-HIGH)

Stronger LEGISLATION penalising EMPLOYERS found guilty of workplace DISCRIMINATION is required to eliminate the CONTINUANCE of EMPLOYER DISCRIMINATION (0416-EN-HIGH)

these advisory groups could recommend the INTRODUCTION of solar-POWERED REFRIGERATION within vaccine SUPPLY cold chains (0423-EN-HIGH)

It is also possible for the patterns of textual impact to co-occur, achieving added benefits of text cohesion and meaning condensation. In the excerpt below from the high scoring Text 0402, the meanings of develop, reduce and strategise are condensed into the elaborated nominal group, these POVERTY REDUCTION DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES. Concurrently, the congruent process, to reduce, from the previous sentence is anaphorically reconstrued as the Quality, REDUCTION.

In the global DEVELOPMENT to reduce POVERTY in UNDERSERVED regions including Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the Australian Government and their partnering countries (Australian Government DFAT 2010) as well as including World Bank (2014) are collaborating alongside one another in order to achieve this common goal. Some of these POVERTY REDUCTION DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES include … (0402-MA-HIGH)

Later in the same text, another example of this dual condensation is found in the anaphoric reconstrual of providing financial service as the metaphorical Thing, ESTABLISHMENT, positioned as the Head of an elaborated nominal group, the ESTABLISHMENT of EDUCATIONAL programs.

The second perspective supports a MOVEMENT towards providing financial service EDUCATION to the poor through the ESTABLISHMENT of EDUCATIONAL programs. (0402-MA-HIGH)

Throughout both the low and high scoring texts, elaborated nominal groups are frequently deployed to condense multiple layers of meanings into a single participant. However, the high scoring students demonstrate greater proficiency over the deployment of elaborated nominal groups, using twice as many as the low scoring students and achieving greater control over their reorganisation.

# 3.2.3. Metaphorical cause and effect networks

The third indicator of textual impact is the simultaneous reorganisation of experiential and logical meanings to create metaphorical cause and effect networks. The low scoring texts deploy seventeen cause and effect networks compared to only sixteen occurrences in the high scoring texts. Although both low and high scoring texts deploy these metaphorical networks at a similar rate, the quality with which they are deployed varies greatly. For example, in the following excerpts, the newly deployed experiential GMs omit the appropriate article (i.e., -the, as in, the ABSENCE of social networks), misapplies the prep osition (i.e., -of in the nominal groups, the LEADING CAUSE of disease and the LEADING CAUSE of temperature FLUCTUATION) and inappropriately conjugates the logical process (i.e., lead to).

They face CHALLENGES DUE TO ABSENCE of social networks (0418-KO-LOW)

hemicals contaminating the DISTRIBUTION system are the LEADING CAUSE in disease OUTBREAKS (0444-EN-LOW)

The LEADING CAUSE to temperature FLUCTUATION is the USE of inappropriate STORAGE facilities (0463-EN-LOW)

the other effects post DETENTION LEADS TO DEPRESSION (0468-DA-LOW)

Therefore, although the learners are effectively condensing the experiential meanings and reorganising them into valued cause and effect networks, their control over these reconstruals is limited and may detract from its impact.

In the high scoring texts, metaphorical cause and effect networks are less frequently deployed; however, when they are deployed, they typically reconstrue the co-occurring meanings to achieve grammatically appropriate constructions, as illustrated in the excerpts below.

these technologies often LEAD TO overall cost REDUCTIONS (0423-EN-HIGH)

inadequate financial services CAN RESULT IN increasing POVERTY (0409-NE-HIGH)

The LACK of AWARENESS of the PAY gap HAS LED TO an UNMONITORED workforce, as EMPLOYEES do not acknowledge the PAY to be a concern. UNMONITORED WORKFORCES LEAD TO further DISCRIMINATION as victims of PAY INEQUALITY are UNDERREPRESENTED. (0451-ENHIGH)

Notably, the final excerpt from Text 0451 illustrates a coupling of cause and effect meanings, achieving a Given-New cohesive prosody by repeating the metaphor, UNMONITORED workforces, in Theme position of the subsequent clause. These sequential metaphorical cause and effect networks help build the arguments while maintaining cohesion and elaborating the author's rationale and explanation. In short, both low and high scoring texts reorganise language into metaphorical cause and effect networks with similar frequency. However, the high scoring texts demonstrate slightly higher control and proficiency over these reconstruals.

# 4. Discussion

In general, the high scoring texts deploy experiential GMs more frequently, with slightly greater variation and with more significant textual impact than the low scoring texts. However, despite the lower incidence of experiential GM in the low scoring texts, there are several indicators that these students are developing the resources necessary to succeed, but may simply require more time to practice and refine these linguistic tools.

As discussed earlier, within the Academic Communication units, students are taught the fundamentals of lexical density and grammatical metaphor. The prevalence of experiential GMs in both the low and high scoring texts suggests that the learners are applying these language condensation strategies. However, students require further support to also organise their GMs into cohesive anaphoric patterns, elaborated nominal groups and metaphorical cause and effect networks. Students may also require another layer of revision to ensure that this newly condensed and restructured language is coherently and appropriately deployed (e.g., using appropriate articles and prepositions). Of particular concern here is the incidence of overcondensing certain expressions, resulting in nonsensical expressions such as the example from Text 0437 (i.e. drastic IMPLICATIONS to the AVAILABILITY of GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT).

Allowing more people into the country will LEAD TO an OVERCROWDING effect, leaving the Australian POPULATION with housing SHORTAGES and drastic IMPLICATIONS to the AVAILABILITY of GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. (0437-EN-LOW)

In short, while it is beneficial for learners to increasingly condense their language into more sophisticated, elaborated nominal groups linked in cause and effect networks, density at the expense of clarity will only disadvantage the student and result in less successful texts. Therefore, while instruction may initially focus on packing grammatically intricate expression into lexically dense structures, it should also involve a revision stage that includes an explicit ‘unpacking’ of the newly deployed GMs to clarify whether the language remains coherent to the reader in both its ‘packed’ and ‘unpacked’ states. In other words, if the author of Text 0437 had unpacked the experiential GMs IMPLICATION, AVAILABILITY, GAINFUL and EMPLOYMENT, he or she may have recognised the inappropriateness of IMPLICATIONS in this context (i.e., leaving the Australian population with fewer houses, and drastically imply that gainful employment is unavailable) and may have chosen a clearer alternative, such as: leaving the Australian POPULATION with housing SHORTAGES and decreased opportunity for GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT.

# 5. Conclusion

Grammatical metaphor is often regarded as a key linguistic resource for achieving valued academic texts, with researchers identifying its presence in successful language as foundational for constructing text features such as lexical density, cohesion and argument development (Byrnes, 2012; Schleppegrell, 2001; 2004). This study has explored the role of experiential GM deployment to further explicate the theory of GM and to identify its impact on learner success, identifying patterns found in high scoring texts and contrasting them with those found in low scoring texts. Arguably, the ten texts analysed in this study cannot be empirically representative of the successful and less successful text distinction, nor do they aim to be. Rather, this small-scale study has provided a systematic, comparative analysis of GM patterns according to learner success that may function as a model for examining larger bodies of texts and investigating whether these patterns consistently correlate with successful and less successful performance in academic contexts.

Across the study, the frequency of GM use varied only slightly between these two groups of students, suggesting that GM deployment alone is not the marker of successful academic writing. The textual impact of experiential GM and its condensing, text cohesive effects were then analysed to investigate how these texts manage GM deployment. These findings point to the importance of not only equipping learners with the tools for deploying experiential meanings metaphorically, but also guiding them to evaluate and refine the quality of these reconstruals. The textual impact analysis reveals that, despite the somewhat comparable prevalence of GMs across the low and high scoring texts, less successful students may require additional support to ensure these instances contribute to the text cohesion (i.e., through anaphoric reconstrual), language condensation (i.e., through elaborated nominal groups) and lexically dense, logical reasoning (i.e., through cause and effect networks) esteemed in academic discourse.

In conclusion, grammatical metaphor remains a powerful resource for achieving the register patterns valued in academic contexts; however, the analysis suggests that its deployment alone does not ensure a text's success. These findings support the need for analysing GM through an elaborated framework of analysis, accounting for greater variation, quality and effect of its deployment in addition to simply accounting for its presence or frequency of occurrence. With additional instructional support and understanding of these nuances, students may become proficient in deploying GM to achieve the lexical density, cohesion, logical organisation and argument develop so valued in academic discourse.
