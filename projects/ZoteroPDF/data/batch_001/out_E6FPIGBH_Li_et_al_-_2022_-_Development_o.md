This study examines how syntactic complexity evolves in argumentative L2 writing by Chinese first-year university students $( N = 1 0 2 )$ . The participants were at either a low- or upper intermediate level of English language proficiency, like the majority of the first-year non-English language major undergraduates in China. Notably, there has been little research on L2 writing development among such learners of English. The present study addresses this gap. The participants produced three argumentative essays throughout a semester-long academic L2 academic writing course. Drawing on a multidimensional perspective on syntactic complexity, the analysis employed twelve holistic complexity measures of three types. The data were analyzed with the aid of the Second Language Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2scA) and Stanford Tregex. The findings showed a non-linear trajectory of syntactic complexity development. Notably, there was less of the coordinated clausal complexity and more of nominal complexity in the students' L2 writing. The upper-intermediate group showed greater progress in employing complex nominal types, and there were statistically significant differences in the measures of pre-adjective, postpreposition and nominal clauses between the two groups. Pedagogical implications are drawn from these findings.

# 1. Introduction

In studies on linguistic features in second language (L2) writing, syntactic complexity has been recognized as the most prominent indicator of L2 learners writing development (Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Kyle Crossey, & Verspoor, 2021; Ortega, 2003). Over the past decades, the majority of studies within this research domain have given primary attntion to distinguishing and employing measures of syntactic complexity that capture and reflect the writing development (Foster & Skehan, 1996; Hunt, 1965; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Wolfe-Quinter, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998). Recently, ther research strands have become prominent, such as the correlation of syntactic complexity with writing quality (Casal & Lee, 2019; Lu, 2011; Taguchi, Crawford, & Wetzel, 2013), the efects f frst language (L1) (Kuiken & Vedder, 2019; Lu & Ai, 2015), the influence of topic and task (Soh, Tam, & Nikitina, 2020; Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015), and the effcts of genres (Brimo & Hall-Mill, 2019; Maxwell-Reid & Kartika-Ningsih, 2020). These research efforts have deepened our knowledge and allowed for multitudinous perspectives on the subject of syntactic complexity; they have also yielded important pedagogical implications.

The rich body of litrature notwithstanding, much remains to be gained from further explorations of how syntactic complexity develops, particularly in the context of writing instruction given to first-year university students for whom English is a foreign language. As Casal and Lee (2019) reminded, a first-year L2 writing course \*represents a crucial intersection between general English language development and the ability to engage in academic writing practice and genres' (p. 52). In China, university students begin their formal academic training by taking intensive English writing courses. The argumentative essay i considered an important genre for developing L2 written proficiency (Friginal Li, & Weigle, 2014) and it isoften employed in the teaching and evaluating of L2 writing in China. L2 writing courses are intensively taught and rigorously asessed in order to enable students to progress from employing colloquial language to developing academic writing proficiencies (Maxwell-Reid & Kartika-Ningsih, 2020).

The impact of writing instruction on L2 writing development is a topic of considerable interest for researchers and English language educators. Many such studies have been implemented among L2 learners at a tertiary level (Bulte & Housen, 2014; Casal & Lee 2019; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015). However,comparatively lttleattention has en given to the L2 writings produced by first-ear students in intensive 2 writing courses. Also, prior studies tended to rely on data collcted from students who are relatively highly proficient in English (Biber & Gray, 2011; Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples & Reppen, 2016; Yang et al, 2015). Consequently, les is known about the development of syntactic complexity among L2 writers at low and intermediate proficiency levels and whether the developmental trajectory varies among students at diffeent proficiency leels over an extended period of time. This is a notable omission in reearch literatre because the majorit of first-r university students in China reat intermediat levels of English language proficiency, which range from a lower-to an upper-intermediate level. A thorough exploration of relevant isues involving such students will advance our current knowledge and yield some important pedagogical implications.

Against such a background, the main goal of this study was to systematically investigate the syntactic complexity features of argumentative essays written by Chinese first-year university students at two intermediate proficiency levels. Drawing on a multidimensional perspective, this study firstly examined holisticall the measures of syntactic complexity. Secondly, it aessed the use of specific types of complex nominals, such as nominal modifiers, nominal clauses, and gerunds/infinitives in subject position. The findings are discussed in light of syntactic complexit features, levels of L2 proficiency, and implications for L2 writing instruction.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Syntactic complexity in L2 writing research

As Hunt (1965) stated, syntactic complexity is a measure reflecting grammatical tructure, and also "a method of procedure which is coherent, systematic, broad, yet capable of refinement to accommodate details' (p. 21). With regard to L2 writing, syntactic complexity refers to a range of language forms, especiall the level of certain forms that learners present i their writing (Ortega, 2003). A more complex grammatical written production attests to a \*more elaborate language" and a greater variety of syntactic patterning" (Foster & Skehan, 1996, p. 303).

Studies on syntactic complexity and L2 writing traditionally use T-unit and clausal subordination-based measures to assess L2 writing development (Elli & Yuan, 2004; Larsen-Freeman, 2006; Nelson & Van Meter, 2007). Finding this approach to be lacking, Biber et al. (2011) inroduced conversational register as a comparison benchmark. Their corpus analysis of 429 research articles and conversation sub-corpus (723 text file) indicated that the use of clausal subordination is distinctive in spoken discourse but not in academic writing. Therefore, as the researchers proposed, alternative features such as complex noun phrases, prepositional phrases and embedded dependent clauses could be more effective in distinguishing complexity levels in academic writing.

In addition, Biber et al. (2011) noted that developmental stages in L2 writing are typically considered to progress from finte dependent clauses functioning as constituents in other clauses, through intermediate stages of non-finite dependent clauses and phrases functioning as constituents in other clauses, and finll to the las stage requring dense use f phraal (non-clausal) dependent structures that function as constituents in noun phrases" (p. 30). This view calls for a variety of measures. For instance, the coordination index would be appropriate to gauge syntactic complexity in L2 writings at beginning levels subordination measures could be employed for intermediate levels of L2 writen production; measures of phrasal complexity would indicate more advanced levels as synoptic styles would be increasingly evident. In a nutshell, the role of phrasal structure, particularly complex phrases with phrasal modifiers (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2013, p. 192) has been given greater recognition in assessing L2 academic writing.

Recognizing the importance f developing phrasal complexty and the fact that syntactic complexity is not asingle construct (Biber et al., 2011), researchers have adopted a multidimensional perspective of syntactic complexity. It advocates for the multidimensional sets of measures, incorporating sub-constructs of general or global complexity (e.g., mean length of T-unit), complexity by subordination and coordination or clausal complexity (e.g., dependent or coordinated clauses per T-unit) and complexity via phrasal elaoration or phrasal complexity (e.g, complex nominals per T-unit) (Biber et al., 2011; Lu, 2010, 2017; Norrs & Ortega, 2009). This conceptualization promotes sophisticated and varied measures to assess L2 writing quality with emphasis on the "interpretation-centered" syntactic complexity and "systematic, dynamic, multivariate, longitudinal and descriptive accounts" of L2 writing processes (Norris & Ortega, 2009, p. 574).

The present study adopts the multidimensional perspective of syntactic complexity where global and clausal measures are deemed relevant for assessing early stages of L2 academic writing development, and phrasal dimensions are pertinent for measuring further advancements. This study acknowledges the relevance and value of the developmental pattern of L2 writing proposed by Biber et al. (2011) for interpreting English language learners' L2 academic writing. Based on the available scholarly literature, it can be hypothesized that the development of L2 writing would progress from relying on coordinated and subordinated structures to employing phrasal elaboration and complex noun phrases expansions. It could be further posited that in a semester-long intensive L2 writing instruction, these patterns of progression and related linguistic features willbe manifested in the students' L2 writing.

# 2.2. Assessment of syntactic complexity in L2 writing research

Scholarly studie on syntactic complexity and L2 writing have sought to identify sets of measures that holistically reflect the whole writing system (Biber, Gray, & Staples, 2016; Lu, 2017; Ortega, 2003). Wolf-Quinter et al. (1998) conducted a meta-analysis of complexity ratios in 39 empirical studies on the relationship between syntactic measures and L2 writing proficiency levels. The researchers identified five types of syntactic measures with fifteen different complexity ratio. Among them, mean length of T-unit (MLT), mean length of clause (MLC), clauses per T-unit (C/T), and dependent clauses per clause (DC/C) were distinguished as the most satisfactory measures because they were consistently linked with holistic rating levels. A meta-analysis by Ortega (2003) examined the use of syntactic measures in 27 studies. The researcher found that 25 studies employed MLT either as the only measure or in combination with other measures. Ortega also re-examined the measures from Wolfe-Quintero et al.'s (1998) study and concluded that the proposed MLT measure was robust for assessing L2 writing complexity at different levels of proficiency.

Clausal-level complexity is another often-used measure. It gauges the amount of subordination and coordination structures in a given production unit Due to the ease of analysis, subordination has become the measure of choice in L2 writing research (Norris & Ortega, 2009). It has bee asessed in various ways, including holistic measures such as clause per T-unit and dependent clauses per clause (Lu, 2010; Skehan & Foster, 2005), as well as measures comprising conditional clauses, adverbial clauses and relative clauses (Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Staples & Reppen, 2016). At the same time, an alternative measure such as clausal coordination (Bardovi-Harlig, 1992),captures complexity in L2 writing at low level of proficiency and is rarely employed in research studies (see Norris & Ortega, 2009).

As stated earlier, Biber et al. (2011) challenged the practice of using T-unit based and clausal subordination measures. They pointed out that finite clauses functioning as adverbials and verb complements ( $\mathrm { _ { y + } }$ that, ZERO, and wH) are typical for everyday conversations. In contrast, academic writing mostly utilizes phrasalstructures to construct ideas. In terms of phraal complexity, it has been proposed that noun modification, which refers to the construction of noun phrases with pre- or post-modifiers to head nouns, is an important indicator of L2 writing development (Biber et al., 2011). In this present study, we employed the definition \*complex nominal" as elaborated in Lu (2010, p. 483) that places emphasis on the complexity of noun phrases in phrasal complexity. Complex nominal refers to anoun modified by nominal modifier (eg., nouns with pre-adjective, post-preposition, posessive, relative clause, participle or appositive), nominal clauses, or gerund and infinitival subjects. As a part of multidimensional construct of syntactic complexity, the five measures of phrasal complexity have ately received considerable atention from scholars due to their role in L2 writing development of learners at different levels of language proficiency (Ansarifar, Shahriari, & Pishghadam, 2018; Casal & Lee, 2019; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples & Reppen, 2016). This fact highlights the ned for further empirical examinations of the phrasal dimensions of syntactic complexity in academic writing and the use of appropriate metrics.

# 2.3. Syntactic complexity and L2 argumentative writing

Syntactic complexity has been asssed in different genres of academic writing including argumentative, narrative and expository essays (Lu, 2011), descriptive essays (Connor-Linton & Polio, 2014), research abstracts (Ansarifar et al., 2018) and source-based research papers (Casal & Lee, 2019). Argumentative writing as a specific genre is a prominent focus of attention in research on syntactic complexity and L2 writing development It has been noted that among the modes of non-creative writing, argumentative writing requires a particular level f abstraction and skillto persuade readers (Ortega, 2015). As Schultz (1991) pointed out, it is a highly demanding task for L2 writers because a \*writer must go through a complex process which includes examining a problem, evaluating evidence, generating and testing hypotheses, and redefining them in accordance with new ideas and evidence (p. 412).

Among empirical studies on syntactic complexity in students' L2 argumentative writing, Parkinson and Musgrave (2014) compared the development of noun phrase use in two groups of postgraduate students at two levels of proficiency. They found that the lower proficiency group had relied heavily on attributive adjectives, whereas the higher proficiency group tended to use more noun modifiers to construct ideas. Mazgutova and Kormos (2015) implemented a short-term longitudinal study that analyzed writen data collected at two points in time (i.e., Week 1 and Week 4) during a one-month long intensive English for Academic Purposes program. The researchers reported substantial developmental changes in the texts produced by the students in a lower proficiency group (i.., average IELTS score of 5.9) in terms of increased use of complex nominals, including pre-adjective modifiers, post-preposition modifiers, and the use of relative clauses as post-modifiers. However, there were no such changes at the syntactical level i the writing by the higher proficiency group of students (i.e., average IELTS score of 6.7). The researchers also noted that the L2 texts by the more advanced students contained more abstract lexical features.

A semester-long study by Staples and Reppen (2016) asssed language used in two writing genres (i.e., argumentative and hetorical analysis) of students with different L1s (i.e., Arabic, Chinee and English). The rearchers found that al three 1 groups tended to use phraal features, such as atributie adjectives and premodfying nouns, in their argumentative essays rather than in the rhetorical analysis texts. At the same time, L1 Arabic and L1 Chinese writers employed more attributive adjectives and premodfying nouns in their long arguments. Yoon and Polio (2017) focused on the development of syntactic complexity in a longitudinal 15-week study. They examined narrative and argumentative essays, collcted at 2-to 3- week intervals, written by highly advanced university students. The rearchers detected statistically ignificant dfferences in the development of syntactic complexity in theagumentative essays involving more apparent complexity at the phrase level.

It should be noted that studies on syntactic complexity and L2 argumentative writing development tend to focus on university students with comparatively high levels of English language proficiency. Less proficient L2 learners have received lessattention in scholarly literature. This gap has been noted and addressed in some recent studies conducte among beginner and low-intermediate adolescent EFL lerners (Kyle et al, 2021; Maxwell-Reid, 2015; Maxwell-Reid & Kartika-Ningsih, 2020; Qin & Uccell, 2016). Despite these research effort, there is till a paucity of studies that have explicitly targeted first-year university students at an intermediate proficiency level as participants. In essence,studies among university students who have a very limited experience of writing L2 argumentative essays are stll lacking. This omission is particularly conspicuous in view of the observation that first-year university students have the pressing need to use increasingly complex and sophisticated language in order to convey precise and specialized meanings within disciplinary writing" (Staples, Egbert, Biber, & Gray, 2016, p. 6).

In the context of China, English language L2 writing clases for first-year university students are structured with the aim to advance the learners lexical and grammatical knowledge and develop their ability to apply a variety of language skills (Wang & Gao, 2008) However, therei limited understanding of developmental trajectories in the L2 argumentative writing of first-year Chinese university students. Particularly lttleis known about the evolution of syntactic complexity. Further empirical research in this area is important for informing L2 writing instruction of \*the best matching of targeted areas for complexification with relevant proficiency levels" (Ortega, 2015, p. 90). There is also a pressing need to determine syntactic complexity measures that are relevant and pertinent for assessing intermediate universty-level English language leaners writig development (Jiang, Bi, & Liu, 2019; Verspoor, Lowie, Chan & Vahtrick, 2017).

Against this background, the present study has adopted a multidimensional perspective of measurement to investigate the development of syntactic complexity in argumentative essays written by Chinese first-year universty students at an intermediate level of English language proficiency. This study's primary aim was to examine the developmental trajectory in terms of holistc complexity, namely, global, clausal and phrasal features, and specific phrasal dimensions of complexity, such as complex nominal features. The exact proficiency level of the students was considered important. Therefore, the fact that the students were at two dferent phases of the intermediate proficiency level was taken into account. This could allow for a more insightful examination of the students' L2 writing development. The research questions that motivated this study were as follows:

1. How do holistic syntactic complexity measures develop in argumentative essays written by Chinese first-year university students?   
2. How does the phrasal dimension of syntactic complexity feature measured by complex nominals develop in the students' L2 argumentative essays?   
3. Does the level of English language proficiency have any effect on the development of syntactic complexity in the students' L2 argumentative writing?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Research context and participants

The participants in this study were Chinese first-year students $( N = 1 0 2$ ) majoring in chemistry $\left( n = 5 1 \right)$ ) and biology $\left( n = 5 1 \right)$ . In China, allstudents who do not major in the English language are required to take Band 4 of the College English Test (CET) in their junior years of university study. For this reason, the L2 writing instruction for these students is exam-oriented.

The participants in the current study were receiving $\mathsf { 1 . 5 h }$ of English language writing instruction per week during the 16-week long semester. The course was taught by the same instructor. Particular emphasis was placed on argumentative essay writing, which is part of the CET4 asessment. The participants were divided into two groups based on their proficiency level according to the university endorsed criteria. To be more pecific, those students who scored between 60 and 90 points (out of 150 in total) in the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) were assigned into the lower-intermediate proficiency group. The students who scored between 90 and 120 points were placed in the upper-intermediate group. Prior to data collection, a survey was conducted to gain background information on the participants (see Table 1). All students reported Chinese as their first language.

# 3.2. Data collection

The participants were required to submit the argumentative essays as part of the course assessment. The data were collcted at the very beginning (Week 1), middle (Week 8) and end (Week 16) of semester. This approach llowed for a more granular analysis of the students' L2 writing development. The writing sessons were conducted in acomputer lab and the students were asked to write and submit their essays electronically through an online writing platform. They were given $4 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ to write with no access to external resources. Table 2 offers a description of the dataset.

Note: $\mathbf { S D = }$ standard deviation; Group ${ \bf 1 } =$ first-year college students at a lower-intermediate proficiency level; Group $2 =$ first-year college students at an upper-intermediate proficiency level.

Both groups received the same topic for each writing session (see Appendix). The topics elicited the students' opinions about aspects of their daily ife that were familiar and relevant to them. In terms of cognitive complexty, each topic centered on only one phenomenon or isue (e.g., having strong will power) and involved only one proposition (e.g., having strong will power leads to success.The prompts invited the students to inquire into the truth value of the stated proposition. In this sense, the topics were at the same level of cognitive complexity and the findings were not likely to be influenced by any potential topic ffect. The word limit for each wrtten text was between 120 and 180 words, in accordance with the CET4 standard. The resulting dataset consisted of 306 pieces of texts with a word count of 43,302 words (see Table 2).

# 3.3. Coding scheme of syntactic complexity

Several measures were employed in this study to evaluate the development of syntactic complexity (see Tables 3 and 4). The operationalization of syntactic complexity usuall includes two coding sets with different research foci; this approach was adopted in the current study. Specifically, the first set consisted of twelve syntactic complexity measures that were holistic and ratioriented. There were three dimensions of overall syntactic complexity, namely, global, clausal and phrasal complexity, as recommended in previous studies (Graesser, McNamara, Louwerse, & Cai, 2004; Lu, 2010; Norris & Ortega, 2009) (see Table 3).

The twelve measures can be asessed by automatic analyzer (Lu, 2010). Two measures, namely, clauses per sentence (C/s) and complex T-unit per T-unit (CT/T) were omitted from this sudy due to their low validity as language development indicators (Ai & Lu, 2013; Yoon & Polio, 2017). Overall the scale of indices proposed by Lu (2010) is inclusive enough to give a granular perspective on L2 writing development (Lu, 2011; Paquot, 2018).

In order to include measures that would allow asessing advanced L2 writing, of which academic writing is one example, this study employed an additional se of measures in afollow-up analysis. The selection of these measures was based on the empirical finding that complex nominals areused frequently and are particularly important in academic L2 writing (Ansarifar et al., 2018; Bber et al., 2016; Bulte & Housen, 2014; Casal & Lee, 2019; Crossey & McNamara, 2014). Hence, the rationale for the present study's analysis i rooted in an assumption that the trajectory of L2 writing progreses from informal language use (e.g., clausal constituents) to a scholarly type of writing (e.g., complex nominals). Based on this premise, three types of measures were adopted from Lu (2010) to examine the development of complex nominals in the students' written texts. These measures were: (1) nominal modifiers (nouns with pre-adjective, post-preosition, possesive, relative clause, participle or appositie) () nominal clauses, and (3) gerunds/infinitives in subject position (see Table 4).

In the present study,all selected measures occurred frequently in the corpus and wer normalied to a rate of occurrence per 1000 words for further statistical analysis.

# 3.4. Analytical tools

Several analytical tools were employed, including L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA) (Lu, 2010), MacOS terminal, Stanford parser and Stanford Tregex. The L2CA employs 14 indices of syntactic complexity reviewed in Wolfe-Quinter e al. (198) and Ortega (2003) in five categories of complexity (i.e., length, sentence complexity, subordination, coordination and phrases); it has demonstrated a good reliability in analyzing corpus data (Lu, 2010, 2011; Wu, Mauranen, & Lei, 2020; Yoon & Polio, 2017.

Stanford parser (Klein & Manning, 2003) assesses grammatical structures of sentences. In this study, the L2 texts were processed with the aid of Penn Treeank annotations (Marcus, Santorini, & Marcinkiewicz, 1993 for a subsequent analysis with Stanford Tregex (Levy & Andrew, 2006). The analysis of complex nominal features using Stanford Tregex (Levy & Andrew, 2006) matched and tallied particular yntactic patterns in trees In terms of the accuracy fthe extraction proces in Stanford Treex, we adopted Casal and Lee's (2019) methods to calculate the standard metrics of precision and recall. Due to their ifrequent occurrences in the corpus, nominal modifiers of possessive, relative clause and participle were not assessed.

To establish reliaility, 100 randomly extracted excerpts from the study'scorpus were coded for each of the two complex nominal features. Reliaility was calculated as the number of agrements (true posities) divided by the number of agrements (true positives) plus the number of disagreements (false positives) (in this case 100). The reliability scores were 0.91 for nominal clauses and 0.94 for gerunds infinitive i subject position. Due to the infrequent ocurrence, the other two complex nominal features were asessed from 50 randomly extracted excerpts. The precision scores were 0.93 for pre-adjective 0.92 for post-preposition.

As for the instances f recall, the students texts were randomly selected and manually coded until 100 codes were developed for nominal clauses and gerundsinfinitives in subject position and 50 codes were identified for pre-adjective and post-preposition measures. Following this Stanford Tregex toolkit automatically extracted the target items from the selected texts. Recall was calcu. lated as the number of instances (identified by Stanford Tregex) divided by the total number of manually coded instances in this case 100 or 50). The recall cores were 0.93 for nominal clause, 0.95 for gerunds infinitives in subject position, 0.87 for pre-adjective and 0.84 for post-preposition.

# 3.5. Data management and analysis

All texts received from the students were cleaned prior to the analysis This included correcting spelling and punctuation. In the frst step of the analysis, the twelve syntactic complexity measures were assessed by the batch mode f web-based interface to L2SCA, which allows analyzing multiple files of written samples. The values for the twelve measures were then extracted in Microsoft Excel and processed by SPss (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software version 26.0.

In the second step of the analysis, Stanford parser parsed the text sequentiall into the form of trebank annotations, ollowing the MacOS command ine. Then, Stanford Tregex tolkit was used to analyze the frequency of types of complex nominals individualy across the corpus. For the consistency of the analysis, we followed the Tregex commands as in Lu (2010, p. 483) and Casal and Lee (2019). A batch file was created to asessall the texts i sequence. The values were then normalized to a rate of occurrence per 1000 words.

To answer research questions $\# 1$ and $\# 2$ , one-way repeated-measures ANOVA test assessed the development of holistic syntactic complexity and complex nominal features at three points in time (i.., Time 1, Time 2 and Time 3). As recommended in methodological literature (Larson-Hall 2015; Soh et al., 2020), the assumptions for the AN0VA test were checked. To answer research question $\# 3$ , an independent sample t-test asessed difference in syntactic complexty between the texts produced by students at the two levels of language proficiecy (i., lower-intermediate and uper-intermedate).Effec size in each type of the statistical analyes was assesed using Cohen's (2013) guidelines.

# 4.1. Development of holistic syntactic complexity

Research question $\# 1$ aimed to trace the development of holistic syntactic complexity features in the students' L2 argumentative essays. For this purpose, this study employed twelve holistic measures representing the three dimensions of syntactic complexit of L2 writing. Table 5 shows the findings from descriptive statistics and ANoVA test. As can be seen from the table, there was an overall decline from Time 1 to Time 3 in two global complexity measures (MLS and MLT), two clausal complexity measures (CP/C and CP/T), and two phrasal complexity measures (MLC and VP/T). In contrast, the measures of C/T, CN/C and CN/T increased over two time points (T1 and T2) and almost returned to the initial level at Time 3.

The one-way repeated-measures ANOVA test showed that there was astatisticall significant decrease with a large ffect size in two coordinated clausal measures, namely, CP/C $( F \left( 2 , 2 0 2 \right) = 1 9 . 2 7 , p < . 0 0 1 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 6 0 )$ and C $\operatorname { P / T } ( F ( 2 , 2 0 2 ) = 1 7 . 4 0 , p < . 0 0 1$ $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ .147) and one phrasal measure V $\operatorname { P } / \mathrm { T } \left( F ( 2 , 2 0 2 ) = 4 . 7 1 , p mathrm { = . } 0 1 3 , \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 4 5 \right)$ though the effect size was small for the latter measure. In a post-hoc test, the Tukey method confirmed a statistically significant decline in the CP/C measure from Time 1 $( M = 0 . 1 9 )$ to Time 2 (M $= 0 . 1 0 \mathrm { \Omega }$ , CP/T measure from Time 1 $( M = 0 . 3 0 )$ to Time 2 $( M = 0 . 1 6 )$ ) and VP/T measure from Time 2 $( M = 2 . 3 1 )$ to Time 3 $( M = 2 . 1 1 )$

The AnOvA test also indicated a statistically significant increase at least in one point in time for two phrasal measures, namely, CN/ $\cot { ( F \left( 2 , 2 0 2 \right) } = 4 . 6 6$ $\scriptstyle p = . 0 1 3$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 4 4 )$ and CN/T $( F \left( 2 , 2 0 2 \right) = 6 . 4 3$ $\scriptstyle p = . 0 0 3$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 6 0 )$ and the effect size ranged from small to medium. The post-hoc test confirmed statistically significant changes in CN/C measure from Time 1 $( M = 0 . 8 4 )$ to Time 2 $( M = 0 . 9 3 )$ which was followed by a decrease at Time 3 $( M = 0 . 8 3 )$ . At the same time, there was a statistically significant increase in CN/T measure from Time 1 $( M = 1 . 3 2 )$ to Time 2 $( M = 1 . 5 3 )$ , which was followed by a decrease at Time 3 $( M = 1 . 3 1$

In sum, the findings indicated that during the semester-long instruction, L2 writing complexity developed to a lesser extent in terms of coordinated clausal structures (CP/C and CP/T) and phrasal structures (VP/T). Also, there was a non-linear advancement in the development of complex nominal constructs (CN/C and CN/T).

# 4.2. Development of phrasal dimension of syntactic complexity

Research question $\# 2$ addressed the development of the phrasal dimension of syntactic complexity. Table 6 presents the findings from descriptive statistics and ANOVA test. As the table shows, the students employed complex nominals intheir writen production. The number of nominal clauses was relatively high and kept increasing steadily with the highest core obtained at Time 3, which attest to a linear developmental pattern.

Constructions with nominal modifiers and gerunds/infinitives in subject position were comparatively rare. Nevertheless a linear pattern of development from Time 1 to Time 3 could be observed for nominal modifiers (e.g., pre-adjective and post-preposition measures); at the same time, the use of gerunds/infinitives in subject position was declining.

Results of the one-way repeated-measures ANOVA test pointed to a statisticall significant increase with a large effect size of the post-preposition measure from Time 1 to Time 3 $( F ( 2 , 2 8 ) = 4 . 2 5$ $\scriptstyle p = . 0 2 5$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 2 3 3 )$ . A statistically significant decrease with a large effect size was observed in the use of gerunds/infinitives in subject position $( F ( 2 , 2 8 ) = 7 . 4 7 , p = . 0 0 3 , \eta ^ { 2 } =$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 3 4 8 )$ . The Tukey procedure confirmed that the nominal modifiers measure experienced a statistically significant increase from Time 1 $M = 2 . 6 7 $ ) to Time 2 $\left( M = \right)$ 5.05). In short, in comparison with the other types of complex nominals, the structures with nominal clauses were abundant in the students L2 argumentative essays. In terms of nominal modifiers the students tended to employ fewer nominalization constructions, except for the pre-adjective and post-preposition. This result might indicate a lack of suficient language resources to employ for compression and abstraction required in the argumentative essay writing genre.

# 4.3. The effect of English language proficiency level on the development of syntactic complexity

Research question $\# 3$ aimed to investigate whether the students' proficiency level in English would affect the development of syntactic complexity, including both holistic and complex nominal measures. Fig. 1 and Table 7 show that in terms of the holistic complexity asessed by twelve indicator, the texts written by the students at the upper-intermediate proficiency level (i. Group 2) had a higher level of syntactic complexity for all indicators, except for T/S.

This pattern however was not maintained throughout the semester. At Time 3, the students at the lower-intermediate lel i., Group 1) showed increased performance on nine out of twelve measures, with the CP/C, CP/T, and CN/C measures being exceptions. In terms of global measures, there was a steady increase in the MLS and MLT measures from Time 1 to Time 3 in the writings by the lower-intermediate group. In contrast, the texts produced by the upper-intermediate group showed a downward developmental tra jectory. With regard to the clausal measures of yntactic complexit, there was an upward trend in subordinated clausal measures (i., C/T, DC/C and DC/T) from Time 1 to Time 3 in the written production by the lower-intermediate group. The opposite trend was in evidence for the upper-intermediate cohort. Additionally, there was a decrease in the coordinated clausal measures (CP/C, CP/T and T/S) in both groups. A notable finding is that the phrasal complexity measures exhibited a more pronounced variation in the L2 writing by the two groups of student. In particular, there was an overall decrease in the phraal complexity measures in the texts produced by the upper-intermediate group. In the texts produced by the lower-intermediate group, a non-linear developmental pattern was observed for the phrasal complexity measures, except for the MLC measure which decreased from Time 1 to Time 2 and returned to its initial level at Time 3.

The independent sample t-test detecte several stisically significant differences btween the two groups of students (seeTable 8) At Time 1, such differences with a medium or close to medium effect size existed in the measures of MLT $\left( p = . 0 2 9 \right)$ , C/T $( p = . 0 2 2 )$ DC/C $( p = . 0 1 4 )$ , DC/T $( p = . 0 0 9 )$ , CN/T $( p = . 0 0 9 )$ , and VP/T $\left( p = . 0 0 3 \right)$ . At Time 3, statistically significant differences were found in the measures of MLS $( p = . 0 0 1 )$ , C/ $\Gamma \left( p = . 0 4 9 \right)$ , CP/C $\left( p = . 0 3 9 \right)$ , T/S $( p = . 0 1 8 )$ , and VP/T $\left( p = . 0 3 3 \right)$ , with the effect size ranging from a close to medium to large. No statistically significant differences were found at Time 2.

Regarding syntactic complexity measured by complex nominal features, the students at the lower-intermediate proficiency level had employed a considerably greater number of nominal modifiers, including pre-adjective and post-preposition measures, at Time 2 compared to Time 1 (see Fig. 1 and Table 9), though these measures returned to almost the original levelat Time 3. In contrast, there was a steady upward developmental trajectory for these measures in the L2 writings by the upper-proficiency group. By the end of semester (i.e, at Time 3), these students employed more nominal modifiers in their 2 writings, including pre-adjective and postpreposition measures.

Concerning the measure f nominal clauses and gerunds/infinitives in subject position, as Table 9 shows, thessays by the upper intermediate group of language learners contained the highest number of nominal clauses throughout the study. The texts by the lower-intermediate group employed the highest number of gerunds/infinitives in subject position at Time 3. The independent sample ttest (see Table 8) indicated a statisicaly significant ifference between the two groups in the use of nominal clauses at Time 1 and Time 3 $( p = . 0 3 9$ $p = . 0 3 7 )$ , nominal modifiers in post-preposition at Time 3 $( p = . 0 1 1 )$ and nominal clauses at Time 2 $( p = . 0 0 5 )$ Implications from this study's empirical findings are discussed in the next section.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. Summary of findings

The findings of the present study have revealed five major trends in the development of syntactic complexity in argumentative L2 writing by Chinese frs-year universty students who were at two different stages of an intermediate proficiency level in English. First there were statisicall signficant non-linear changes in several holistic and complex nominal measures. Second, non-linear devel. opment of clausal complexity was evident in the students' L2 writing by the end of the semester. Third, in terms of holistic complexity measures, the students at the lower-intermediate level of English language proficiency showed considerably greater improvements in several parameters compared to their more advanced peers. Fourth, among complex nominal constructs, only the structure of nominal clauses was abundantly used by the students. Finall, regarding the expectation that the more proficient students would employ greater numbers of complex nominal constructs, the results demonstrated that nominal clauses, pre-adjective and post-preposition measures were prominent in the students' texts.

Overall the findings provide empirical evidence for the developmental changes in syntactic complexity in the students L2 writing. In terms of the twelve holistic measure, the reults are in line with prvious studie. Specifically, the finding tht there was a decrease in the use of coordinated clausal structure (measured by CP/C and CP/T) and an increase in the phrasal structure (measured by CN/C and CN/T) aligns with the results reported by Bardovi-Harlig (1992) and Biber et al. (2011). These researchers discovered that as L2 writers progres from beginner to more advanced levels of English language proficiency they tend to move from relying oncoordinated constructs toward employing more complex structures.

At the same time, our findings indicated that such widely-employed holistic measures as MLT and MLC were es relevant in the development of L2 writing. In terms of the phraal structure, our findings align with the results reported in recent studies that detected a clear upward trend in the occurrence of complex nominal structures in L2 textboos (Jin, Lu, & Ni, 2020). From a pedagogical perspective this fct highlights the need to align L2 writing instruction with the paterns of language leaners linguistic development and select the teaching materials that include patterns of various dimensions of syntactic complexity.

A noteworthy finding of the present study is that in terms of holistic measures the participants at a lower proficiency level had made better progres compared to their more advanced peers, which aligns with the findings reported by Mazgutova and Kormos (2015). This finding is not unexpected as students at a higher English language proficiency level according to the NCEE standard would have more knowledge of basic syntax in the English language, which would in turn result in a mild development of their L2 writig. Besides, an incremental developmental pattern in the texts by the lower proficiency group mirrors the trajectory of syntactic complexity development in studies by Biber et al. (2011) and Norris and Ortega (2009). These results highlight the importance and validity of holistic syntactic measures in assessments of L2 written texts.

The study also found that complex nominal features, such as pre-adjective, post-preposition and participle nominal modifiers, were mostly employed in the writings of a higher proficiency group, which aligns with the results reported by Casal and Lee (2019) and Parkinson and Musrave (2014). However, compared to earlier studies, the other types of nominal modifiers were not prominent inthe students writigs. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that Chinese first-year universty students tend to have arelatively low level of English language proficiency and they lack a prior robust L2 academic writing instruction. However, by the end of the course, there was a greater frequency in the use of nominal modifiers in the texts written by the upper-intermediate group. This could be attributed to a greater awareness of the importance of more elaborated noun phrases use that the student-writers had developed during the course. This result attests to a progressin the students 2 writing development even though the ratio of nominal modifiers was smaller compared to Casal and Lee's (2019) study.

We also found that the students at a higher level of proficiency tended to employ nominal clauses more often compared to their peers at a lower proficiency level. These results are diffrent from those reported by Casal and Lee (2019) who discovered that advanced L2 writers made arelatively low use of nominal clauses. However, i should be noted that although nominal clauses function as noun phrases in sentences, which enhances syntactic complexity, an excessive reliance on nominal clauses could be problematic. In our data for example, $3 4 \%$ of nominal clauses involved cognitively-oriented verbs (e.g., think and believe) in the writings by the lower-intermediate group and ${ } ^ { 2 3 \% }$ in the writings by the upper-intermediate group. As the example below demonstrates, the students would often employ a chain of that-complement clause headed by the verb think, which is typical fr conversation-type of expressing one's opinion:

Firstly, I think diet is bad for heath ..econdy I think diet is bad for stdy, work, ee life .. Thirdy, I think diet is bad for mental health. As girl,I think although it' significant to pursue beauty, diting is bad to our health. I think if you are kind, you have a beautiful soul. <Group 2, file 019, time $3 >$

A similar observation was made in other studies. For example, Staples and Reppen (2016) noted that Chinese students often used the verbs think, believe, and say. To concur, Taguchi et al. (2013) pointed out that verb complement (i.e, verb with that clause) was frequently employed in the texts produced by students at higher levels of proficiency. The findings of the current and earlier studies indicate that L2 writers tend to make extensive use of linguistics devices that are typical for colloquial language when they organize

ideas in their written L2 argumentative texts.

In general, the current study has contributed empirical evidence in support of the development of holistic and phrasal syntactic complexity in argumentative writings of Chinese first-year university students. For the majority of the holistic syntactic complexity measures, the developmental curve was steeper in the upward direction for the lower proficiency group. The higher proficiency group used more of the complex nominal constructs. A notable finding was that by the end of the semester, with the intensification of writing instruction, there had occurred a decreased use f cordinated clausal complexity and an increased use of nominal clauses in students L2 writing. All togeter, the findings highlight he importance of examining the role of syntactic complexty in the development ofL2 writing proficiency at an early stage of university L2 writing instruction.

# 5.2. Methodological and pedagogical implications

A notable methodological implication to be drawn from this study is that a multidimensional set of measures needs to be adopted to asses syntactic complexity. The choice of the measures should depend on research aims and agenda. As this study has demonstrated, coordinated clausal complexity measure CP/C could be important when assessing writings by students a intermediate levels of L2 proficiency. In terms of complex nominal measures, pre-adjective and post-preposition measures extracted from CN/C in L2SCA provided valuableinsights concerning the developmental patterns in the writings by the students in different phases of the inter. mediate level of proficiency. The method proposed by Casal and Le (2019) proved to be effective for asessing individual complex nominal measures in the current study's corpus of L2 writings.

Our findings have highlighted the importance of considering the development of syntactic complexity in L2 writing instruction. A substantial improvement in syntactic complexity in the L2 texts by the lower-intermediate group suggests that L2 writers could benefit from receiving clear and explicit teaching instruction on the use of complex structures. This finding lends support to adopting traditional approaches to the teaching of grammar (Maxwell-Reid & Kartika-Ningsih, 2020). In terms of complex nominal features the current study reported a rlatively care occurrence of nominal modifiers and an excessive reliance by the L2 writer on mental verb complement to construct nominal clauses. These findings have some notable pedagogical implications, particularly in view that the first year of universty study i a critical period for L writing development. Therefore, a complex-structure-oriented teaching syllabus would be desirable. Language educators need to find pedagogical approaches that promote the development of syntactic complexity For example, explicit emphasis on the use of noun phrases would familiarize language learners with the academic writing style. Another finding that could inform L2 writing pedagogy is that the students tended to rely on nominal clauses featured by verb complements to construct complex structures. This indicates the need for clear instruction on how to use academic verbs and implicit expressions of stance (e.., the fact is that ..) in agumentative writing (taples & Reppen, 2016). In adition, a sharp focus on the lexical aspect is imperative inthe first-year L writing clasroom. For example, language instructors could llustrat varios functional purposes of verbs in different writing genres.

Although considerable attention in research literature has been given to measures of syntactic complexity and L2 writing devel. opment, there are considerably fewer studies that introduce effctive ways of teaching complex structures. Among pedagogicallyoriented studies, Bulte and Housen (2014), Mazgutova and Kormos (2015), and Casal and Lee (2019) showed the benefits of intensive L2 writing syllai. Biber and Gray (2011) maintained that enhanced literacy instruction in the L2 writing classroom would equip students with a greater repertoire of linguistic resources and enable the development of complex nominal structures. More recently, Fang, Gresser, Cao, and Zheng (2021) proposed a genre teaching-learning cycle that incorporates four stages and a multitude of activities where students are encouraged to build knowledge of the relevant discipline, analyze exemplar texts, play with a target language (e.g., have definition games) before they proceed to constructing their own texts (p.13). Despite the growing body of pedagogicall-rintd literatre, thefetivenes of intensive language progams and tlored instruction for the teaching of complex structures remains an underexplored area that requires further research efforts.

# 5.3. Limitations and suggestions for future study

As with any research efort, our study has limitations. First the participants proficiency in English was comparatively low, which limits the applicailit of the findings for more advanced 2 writers. Future studies could compare differences in syntactic complexity, particularly variations in noun phrase complexity or nominalizatio, among L2 learner at different levels of proficiency. Second, the study period was limited to one semester. This suggests the need for longitudinal studies that stretch over two or even thre semesters of L2 writing instruction. Third, we examined syntactic complexity only in the argumentative genre of L2 writing. Earlier studies have shown that genres have an impact on written prouction. Therefore, fuure studie could replicate the current research effort using data from different writing genres to enhance our understanding of syntactic complexity development. Fourth, this study adopted a quantitative research design. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods in further research might give more granular insights. Finally, we used the holistic syntactic complexity measures and specific fine-grained phrasal complexity measures proposed by Lu (2010). A wider range of measures of clausal complexity and phrasal complexity in combination with measures based on usage-based theories (Kyle et al., 2021) could be considered in future studies. Notwithstanding these limitations, the current study has provided useful insights into the development of L2 argumentative writing of Chinese first-year university students at the lower- and upper-intermediate levels of English language proficiency.
