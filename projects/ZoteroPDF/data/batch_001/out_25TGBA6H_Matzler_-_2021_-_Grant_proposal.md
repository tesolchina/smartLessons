This study builds on existing genre analyses of research grant proposal abstracts by articulating a framework of move definitions that includes the sequencing and cycling of moves as well as their real-world or science orientation, and by exploring the tension between prototypicality and variation in these patterns. Two settings for national research grant competitions aimed at early-career scientists are introduced, namely the New Zealand Marsden award and the Chilean Fondecyt award. A framework of five constituent moves is formulated and 36 collected grant proposal abstracts are analyzed for their movestructure patterns and accompanying lexico-grammatical signals. A prototypical movestructure pattern is formulated and exemplified with abstracts from both settings and different disciplines, while key variations on this prototypical pattern are also described and analyzed. The findings suggest that a majority of abstracts are near-prototypical in structure (i.e., showing a single variation on a shared prototype) and therefore collectively maintain and reinforce this prototypical pattern as a common reference even as they individually diverge from it for their own rhetorical purposes.

# 1. Introduction

Worldwide, scholars are increasingly pressured to publish high-impact research to advance their careers or to maintain their employment (Hyland, 2015; Lillis & Curry, 2010). Additionally, many science and engineering researchers located in peripheral or off-network settings (Belcher, 2007; Canagarajah, 1996) face the additional challenge of needing to write for publication in English rather than in the main language of their own academic setting (see, e.g., Martinez & Graf, 2016). While the structural and lexico-grammatical features of research articles (RAs) have been described in considerable detail (see Samraj, 2016, for an overview), these RAs form only one link in a large and diverse group of “research-process genres” (Swales, 1990, p. 177). The research grant proposal, in particular, enjoys a special relationship of mutual support with the RA; Myers (1990, p. 41), for example, called grant proposals “the most basic form of scientific writing”, since it provides the funding required for any subsequent scientific activity. Similarly, Swales (1990, p. 178) observed that a researcher’s successful grant application will provide the basis for future research articles; in turn, a respectable track record of publications will then greatly enhance the chances of earning further research grants.

Although grant proposals are a high-stakes genre that will greatly impact a researcher’s career development opportunities, they tend to be classified as confidential documents by research funding agencies and not made public, making them an “occluded genre” (Swales, 1996, p. 47). As a result, novice researchers lack easy access to publicly available exemplars of this genre and cannot learn by imitation, as they would with more widely publicized research genres such as RAs or conference presentations (see also Gurwitz, Milanesi, & Koenig, 2014). This lack of access also affects researchers and practitioners in applied linguistics; Connor & Mauranen, 1999, pp. 47e48), for example, lament the scarcity of available studies of grant proposals and their omission from most graduate writing courses, whereas Flowerdew (2016) observes that the occluded nature of the grant proposal genre severely constrain the availability of suitable materials for her pedagogic purposes. Since exemplars of grant proposals, or even their abstracts, are difficult to obtain in large numbers due to the veils of secrecy maintained by grant agencies and grant writers, this has largely precluded any large-scale text analysis studies, as seen in more widely published research genres. For the same reason, many of the applied linguists who do endeavor to collect and describe the genre of grant proposals have proceeded by gaining access to grant writers or reviewers and therefore have been able to describe in considerable detail not only the textual features of the genre (Connor & Mauranen, 1999; Connor & Upton, 2004, pp. 235e256; Cotos, 2019) but also their authors’ social and disciplinary circumstances (Connor, 2000; Connor & Wagner, 1998; Feng & Shi, 2004), the intertextualities of the research grant genre system (Tardy, 2003), and more recently, its reception by reviewers (Tseng, 2011) and its pedagogical application (Flowerdew, 2016).

Unlike RAs, which in science and engineering are often addressed to a global audience of highly specialized readers, research grant proposals are mostly fed into locally controlled ecosystems, such as government-run funding agencies. The move structures and other defining characteristics of the grant proposal genre have therefore been described in studies that each focused on a specific national or local context, such as Finland (Connor & Mauranen, 1999), the USA (Connor, 2000; Tardy, 2003), Canada (Feng & Shi, 2004), and Hong Kong (Flowerdew, 2016). Building on accounts of grant proposal writing practices in Myers (1990), Connor & Mauranen, 1999 performed an influential move-structure analyses of the genre, collecting and analyzing 34 English-language grant proposals written by Finnish-led research groups for various European Union grants. The aim of their study was described as practical as well as academic, with the published results serving as the basis for a writing workshop for Finnish grant writers and a Finnish-language guidebook. Connor and Mauranen derived moves from three sources: research articles, promotional genres, and new grant-specific moves, proposing a ten-move framework: Territory, Gap, Goal, Means, Reporting previous research, Achievements, Benefits, Competence Claim, Importance Claim, and Compliance Claim. Owing to its overarching aim of securing funding, they also defined the grant proposal as persuasive writing, noting the presence of many rhetorical elements of RA introductions, such as indicating and filling a gap. In a second study, Connor (2000) then assessed the transferability of this move-structure framework to a new socio-cultural context, by applying the same moves from Connor & Mauranen, 1999 to grant proposals written by researchers in the United States. Analyzing fourteen proposals by five different researchers, Connor also interviewed these five researchers at length, finding that the different requirements of the North American grant system required her to refine specific grant writing moves; she also reported notable structural variations among the proposals in her corpus.

Several studies have described differences between the full-length document of a grant proposal and its much shorter abstract, both in terms of structural organization and rhetorical purpose. It appears that the relationship between the grant proposal and its abstract is similar to that found between the RA and its abstract, where Swales (1990) already observed that the RA abstract fulfils a dual role of summary matter and front matter (p.179): while the role of summary matter ensures the adequate representation of the RA’s contents, the parallel role of front matter serves to catch the reader’s eye and to highlight the most attractive aspect of the longer document. Hyland (2004) further elaborates this latter point, calling the RA abstract a “selective representation” (p. 64) in which writers actively negotiate the importance of their work and their own status within the community.

Those studies that separately analyzed full-length grant proposals (GPs) and their much shorter abstracts (GPAs) have come to similar conclusions. For example, Connor & Mauranen, 1999 found that grant proposal abstracts first carefully contextualize their proposed research and then articulate it in relation to this context by means of ‘space-creating’ moves. This aim of analyzing the grant proposal abstract separately from the larger proposal is central to the study by Feng and Shi (2004), who described nine grant proposals written by Social Science researchers at a Canadian university. Employing different move structures for the abstract (three moves) and the full proposal (ten moves), Feng and Shi found a high incidence of what they call move-mixing and move recurrence in the larger grant proposal text, whereas the structure of the abstract is described as “comparatively sequential” (p. 30). For grant proposal abstracts, which they referred to as ‘summaries’, Feng and Shi (2004) proposed three numbered moves: (1) Justifying a research need, (2) Describing means to meet the research need, and (3) Claiming potential contributions; each of these moves then consisted of two or three steps (see Table 1 below).

Finally, Flowerdew (2016) combined both pedagogic and research activities in designing and implementing a writing module focusing on grant proposal abstracts for postgraduate students in science and engineering at a Hong Kong University. Flowerdew synthesized her move framework from several of the above cited studies, particularly Connor & Mauranen, 1999, arriving at seven moves for grant proposal abstracts, namely Territory, Gap/niche, Goal, Means, Achievements, Benefits and Future recommendations. Table 1 presents an overview of the three frameworks proposed in Connor & Mauranen, 1999 Feng and Shi (2004), and Flowerdew (2016).

While the constituent moves available to grant proposal writers have been identified and described in some detail, less attention has been given to how these individual moves come together to form prototypical sequences or move-structure patterns, and how authors may diverge from such prototypical patterns for their own rhetorical purposes. It should be noted that other key genres or part-genres are often described as having relatively stable and identifiable prototypical patterns; for example, Swales’ (1990) original CARS model proposes a sequence of three numbered moves. In discussing counterexamples of Introduction sections that do not conform to this sequence, Swales (1990, pp. 146e147) already notes that “discourse is a phenomenon of propensities”, thus justifying the sequencing (or numbering) of textual elements according to what he calls “suitably robust preferred orders” (idem). Further, Swales suggests that the occasional appearance of exceptions in move sequencing should not be taken as a falsification of the general order but instead as a clue to the rationale behind the generally preferred structures. Similarly sequenced move analyses have also been proposed for other part-genres of the RA, such as Results and Discussion sections (Basturkmen, 2012; Hopkins & Dudley-Evans, 1988; Yang & Allison, 2003), usually consisting of numbered moves and steps, with allowances for variations such as omissions, repetitions, and choices between steps.

In contrast, existing move analyses performed on grant proposals and their abstracts have focused mainly on describing individual constituent moves but mostly remain silent or noncommittal on the issue of how these constituent moves are to be assembled into a whole. For example, Connor and Mauranen (Connor & Mauranen, 1999) observed variations in the order of appearance of individual moves in their corpus and cautioned that “the order in which the moves are presented here is not a canonical order” (p. 53) but rather an approximation and therefore refrain from numbering the moves. Flowerdew (2016) similarly refrained from providing a canonical move order, and described tasks to familiarize her students with move structuring patterning that “can be reordered, mixed, and recurring” (p. 6). Within grant proposal abstracts, an incipient discussion of variations in move-structure patterns is found in an analysis of Canadian research grant proposals and their abstracts by Feng and Shi’s (2004). Drawing attention to the twin practices of move mixing and move recurrence, Feng and Shi observed that these practices added complexity and “fuzziness” (p. 10) to move analyses, and then sought to identify and label some of the resultant larger-scale patterns. For example, they described recurring Territory (T) and Niche (N) moves as forming a “multiple-wave structure” (p. 24) that gradually develops a specific research context. Flowerdew (2016) notes the importance of studies such as Feng and Shi’s for “shedding light on the intricacies of move-structure patterning and its manipulation for rhetorical purposes” (p. 6). The present study aims to further contribute to our understanding of move structures in grant proposal abstracts by articulating a framework of move definitions that includes the sequencing and cycling of moves as well as their real-world or science orientation, and by exploring the tension between prototypicality and variation in these patterns.

# 2. Settings, participants, corpora and disciplines

As noted above, grant proposals are addressed to site-specific funding agencies, often at the national level. This section therefore introduces and describes the two settings (New Zealand and Chile) from which grant proposal abstracts were collected for this study. For each setting, the socio-economic characteristics of the respective research grants is outlined and the genre system (Tardy, 2003) of grant proposal guidelines, full proposal and abstract, is described. The prescribed academic profile of applying scientists is also outlined for each setting.

A key funding mechanism for university-based research in New Zealand is the highly competitive Marsden Fund, administered by Royal Society Te Aparangi. Support for emerging researchers (de  fined as up to seven years after completion of their PhD) is channeled through a special fund called Marsden Fund Fast-Start Grant, which admits single-authored threeyear research projects up to a budget of approx. USD 65,000 per year. Marsden Fund Fast-Start proposals function in a twostage application system (Royal Society Te Aparangi, 2020b), with researchers first submitting a single-page expression of interest and then a full proposal which includes an abstract limited to 200 words (Royal Society Te Aparangi, 2020a  ). While many other government research grant agencies publish only the titles of their funded proposals, the Marsden fund publishes the full 200-word abstracts for all approved proposals on its own website in spreadsheet form; the twenty New Zealand grant proposals analyzed in the present study are collected from the 2017e2019 versions of the award (see, e.g. Royal Society Te Aparangi, 2019  ). Finally, it should be noted that the public CVs of several Marsden-funded NZ-based researchers suggest that they may be EAL (English as an additional language) writers; this implies that it is increasingly difficult to hold that there is such a thing as a native-speaker community in science and engineering disciplines, even among practitioners located in

English-speaking countries. Rather, these academic settings appear to be characterized by increasingly diverse sociolinguistic configurations (Flowerdew, 2016; Perez-Llantada, 2012  ).

Research activities at universities in Chile are highly dependent on financial support from the Chilean government (Mullin, Adams, Halliwell, & Milligan, 2000). Since 1981, the government agency responsible for funding research (abbreviated CONICYT) has held annual scientific research grant competitions (abbreviated Fondecyt); the Chilean grant proposal abstracts collected and analyzed in the present study correspond to the special fund for early career researchers (defined as up to seven years after completion of a PhD) named Fondecyt de Iniciacion en Investigaci  on , which admits single-authored three-year research projects up to a budget of approx. USD 40,000 per year (Fondecyt, 2020). Interestingly, even though the Chilean higher education system is almost exclusively Spanish-speaking, the governmental research funding agency has declared certain knowledge areas in science and engineering as English-only, namely Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Sciences, Engineering, and Agricultural Sciences, obliging all Chilean researchers within these disciplines to present their proposals in English (Fondecyt, 2020). In keeping with the occluded nature of grant proposals, the abstracts of approved grants proposals are not usually made public by the Chilean granting agency; however, some local universities publish annual or biannual research yearbooks which contain the abstracts for all their funded proposals. The sixteen Chilean grant proposals analyzed in the present study are collected from such university yearbooks published corresponding to grant awards received between 2010 and 2016 (see, e.g., Universidad Austral de Chile, 2017).

The four disciplines selected for the present study all fulfill two basic conditions, in that they are similarly represented in both national settings and fall under the English-language requirement in the Chilean setting. Table 2 presents the distribution of collected abstracts according to their national setting and discipline.

To ensure that the collected abstracts from both settings are equivalent in their scope and function, their length was compared by means of a word count. Most New Zealand abstracts congregate towards the upper boundary of 200 words, with a handful of shorter outliers. The Chilean abstracts show a somewhat more varied word count range (152e292 words); however, the median word count of the two settings is almost identical. Table 3 presents the minimal, maximal and median word count for the collected abstracts. The word counts of these New Zealand and Chilean abstracts also appear to be representative of other national settings. For example, the Japanese KAKENHI grant system (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, 2019) similarly requires applications to the early-career scientist grant to include an abstract, in either Japanese or English, with a character count limit that translates to approximately 200 English words.

It should be noted, however, that some other national funding agencies prescribe considerably longer word counts or impose explicit rhetoric and schematic constraints on their abstracts. For example, the guidelines for U.S. National Science Foundation grant proposals (The National Science Foundation, 2019) call for a summary that “should not be an abstract of the proposal” but instead be “suitable for dissemination to the public” (p. 29); the same guidelines further prescribe a format of three separate headings named “Overview, Intellectual Merit, and Broader Impacts”, all within a one-page limit equivalent to approximately 600 words. Such NSF summaries would clearly not be equivalent in either intended audience, rhetorical function, schematic structure or length to the New Zealand and Chilean abstracts described in the present study.

In summary, the two corpora of New Zealand and Chilean grant proposal abstracts analyzed in this study share several key requirements and features: they are addressed to high-profile national research grant agencies, they are authored by emerging scientists, they are publicly accessible yet difficult to find, and they are approximately 200 words in length. The main, and key, difference between the two groups is that the New Zealand abstracts are written in the predominant language of their own setting which coincides with the predominant language of global scientific production, whereas the Chilean abstracts are more akin to English as Lingua Franca (ELF) products, as they are written and read in English by predominantly Spanish-speaking academics.

# 3. The move structure framework and a prototypical pattern

The corpus of 36 abstracts of successful grant proposals collected from the two settings (New Zealand and Chile) was subjected to a move system analysis, and a move framework for grant proposal abstracts was formulated. Methods to analyze the abstracts’ move structures followed the steps outlined in previous studies of grant proposal abstracts (see, e.g. Connor & Mauranen, 1999, pp. 51e52) and the broader literature on ESP genre analysis (e.g., Tardy, 2011, pp. 148e149). Starting with the identification of the (part-) genre’s rhetorical purpose, the function of each text segment was identified. The initial coding scheme was then fine-tuned by means of a pilot analysis and a protocol of moves and their definitions was developed (see Fig. 1). Two measures were taken to strengthen the reliability of classification of moves, following current practice (see, e.g., Parkinson, 2017; Liu & Buckingham, 2018). First, $2 0 \%$ of the data was re-analyzed two months after the initial analysis phase,

Territory (T): describes existing knowledge upon which the proposal is based. This move can take two forms, either describing a real-world problem (e.g., disease, natural disasters) or reporting current scientific knowledge in a field (e.g., genetic markers, tectonic models).   
Niche (N): indicates some limitation identified in the Territory described above. This can either be formulated as a real-world problem that needs solving, a gap in present scientific knowledge, or a potential for further research in a promising direction.   
Goal (G): states the single main purpose or objective of the proposed research. The overall Goal is the central move of the grant proposal abstract (see Section 4 below) and commonly provides the title of the proposal.   
Means (M): lists more specific sub-goals, describes the research methods and materials, and predicts specific results or achievements that contribute to fulfilling the overall goal described above.   
Benefits (B): outlines the expected benefits of the project, usually formulated as an upshot of the overall Goal. This move often shows a dual structure, with benefits to scientific understanding followed by benefits to real-world applications,

with an intra-rater reliability score of $9 3 . 4 \%$ , as calculated in Atlas.ti qualitative data analysis software. Secondly, a research assistant (PhD in Applied Linguistics, not otherwise involved in the study) was trained in the use of the coding scheme and then independently re-analyzed $2 0 \%$ of the dataset, arriving at an inter-rater agreement of $8 9 . 7 \%$ .

The present study takes Flowerdew’s (2016) seven-move framework as the starting point, introducing two further simplifications to reduce the system to five essential moves and omitting any consideration of possible steps within these moves (Fig. 1). The main reason for restricting the complexity of the studied move system lies in the limited word count of approximately 200 words in the collected abstracts; it quickly became apparent that grant proposal abstract writers will realize only a discrete number of moves in such a confined space. However, it should be pointed out that the main aim of the present study is not to argue for a redefinition of the individual constituent moves of a grant proposal abstract, but instead to describe the prototypical sequence or pattern by which the entire move-structure is articulated, as well as the most common variations on this prototypical pattern. Similar prototypes and variations could presumably be identified using the definitions of moves employed in earlier studies. Fig. 1 shows the constituent moves employed in the framework of the present study.

# 3.1. The prototypical pattern: T-N-G-M-B

The moves listed above in Fig. 1 also form a sequence that constitutes the prototypical T-N-G-M-B pattern, in which each move appears exactly once and in the expected order. Fig. 2 shows an Engineering abstract from New Zealand that employs this prototypical pattern. This abstract follows the prototypical T-N-G-M-B pattern; the only minor variation is found in the shortening of the opening Territory (T) move. The prototypical move-structure is further reinforced by clear lexicogrammatical means. For example, note how the transition from the opening Territory (T) move to the Niche (N) move is signaled: “However, the development of x has been severely hindered”. Two further exemplars employing this prototypical pattern, namely a Mathematics abstract from New Zealand (Appendix A) and a Biology abstract from Chile (Appendix B), are presented in the supplementary materials.

# 4. Structural flexibility in move-structure patterns

The definition of constituent moves and the prototypical pattern outlined above provide a solid and convenient base for the analysis of further examples. However, it is equally important to account for variations in move-structure patterning;

![](img/d663a873b89eeed8a63b08c425e951a17466f0fadc5a309d6872ba2f40740a6e.jpg)

therefore, this section will first identify the prevalence of variations among the collected abstracts and then discuss the most prominent of these variations.

# 4.1. Prototypical, near-prototypical, and non-prototypical patterns

The collected abstracts were classified into three categories (prototypical, near-prototypical and non-prototypical) according to how closely their move-structure reproduced the prototypical pattern. Only those abstracts that employ each move once and in the expected order were considered prototypical; those that include a single element of variation but otherwise followed the expected order were considered near-prototypical. Possible variations included the omission of a move, the repetition of a move or of a sequence of moves, and the shifting of a move to a different position in the move sequence. Finally, those abstracts that notably diverge from the prototype by means of two or more of these variations in their move-structure pattern were considered to be non-prototypical. As shown in Table 4, only four abstracts (three from New Zealand and one from Chile) strictly reproduce the prototypical pattern, whereas 20 near-prototypical abstracts present a single element of variation, and 12 non-prototypical abstracts present multiple variations.

A second question concerned the obligatory or optional nature of each move, since one way in which exemplars of a genre can diverge from a prototypical pattern is by omitting one or more of the genre’s constituent moves. However, as shown in Table 5 below, nearly all abstracts make use of the full assortment of five moves: the Territory and Goal moves are clearly obligatory (36 out of 36 abstracts), with the Niche move (33 out of 36) and the Means move (35 out of 36) being quasiobligatory. Surprisingly, the Benefits (B) move appears to be the only move that could be considered optional, being omitted in seven abstracts (three from NZ, four from Chile). This occasional omission of the Benefits move is surprising and appears somewhat counter-intuitive, as the detailed projection of both disciplinary and wider societal benefits is often described as key element of high-stakes grant proposals (see, e.g., Cotos, 2019).

Noting the near-universal presence of all five moves, the key issue becomes what patterns are formed by the various possible move sequences. An additional immediate measure of an exemplar’s prototypicality concerns the moves that occupy the initial and final position. As shown in Table 6, all Chilean abstracts and 15 out of 20 New Zealand abstracts open with the Territory (T) move, while only three New Zealand abstracts instead begin with the Goal (G) move, and two with the Niche (N) move.

In turn, the final position in New Zealand abstracts is almost invariably occupied by the Benefits (B) move, as found in 16 out of 20 exemplars. As shown in Table 7, in those four abstracts where B was either omitted or moved to an earlier position, three ended with the Means (M) move, and one with the Goal (G) move. In the Chilean setting, however, two equally popular choices emerge for ending an abstract, with Means (M) and Benefits (B) employed as final move in seven abstracts each.

In summary, the collected abstracts show remarkably little variation in terms of their optional or obligatory usage of moves and in the moves occupying the initial and final position. However, hidden underneath this apparent regularity, considerable variation can be found in the patterns formed by the move structures employed by authors within the abstract. The most prominent of these variations, namely additional T-N cycles and variations involving the Goal (G) move, will now be discussed in the remainder of this section.

# 4.2. Additional territory $( T )$ and niche (N) cycles

The concept of ‘cycles’ was first introduced to ESP genre analysis by Hopkins and Dudley-Evans (1988) to describe a pattern in RA Discussion sections where moves are not presented in a linear sequence but are instead repeated in groups or ‘cycles’ of moves, often over several iterations. The presence of such cycles in grant proposals has already been noted in Connor (2000); in the present study the collected grant proposal abstracts showed cycles mostly in the early passages involving the Territory (T) and Niche (N) moves, where multiple sequences of (T) and (N) moves are used to present different aspects or layers of a proposal’s context. These additional T-N cycles were found in approximately one-third of the collected abstracts (five from New Zealand and six from Chile), spanning all four studied disciplines. Fig. 3 shows an Earth Sciences abstract from Chile featuring this pattern.

This abstract alternates between Territory (T) and Niche (N) moves for two cycles before moving on to the Goal (G) move. In the opening move (T-1), an existing scientific methodology is summarized, followed by its limitations (N-1). A second Territory move (T-2) then present a more recent scientific development, followed by its problematic and yet unresolved implications for existing theory (N-2). Finally, the Goal (G) move commits to filling this carefully constructed niche. In short, the use of such T-N cycles is employed to signal what Feng and Shi (2004, p. 24) call “the spiral development of research and the advancement of knowledge”; this particular example illustrates the utility of T-N cycles to juxtapose the limitations of established scientific theory with newer developments. A further exemplar employing this pattern, namely an Engineering abstract from New Zealand (Appendix C) featuring three T-N cycles, is presented in the supplementary materials.

A second, somewhat different usage of T-N cycles is found in abstracts that first highlight their applicability to a ‘realworld’ problem and then turn to the corresponding science-oriented Territory and Niche. The contrast employed here between a real-world and a science orientation for the (T) and (N) moves follows the distinction found in Connor & Mauranen,

1999, who distinguished these two types of territory and niche and proposed that these moves could take either or both orientations (p. 6). Fig. 4 shows a Biology abstract from New Zealand with this particular structure.

This particular abstract begins by laying out a general real-world Territory (T-rw), and then signals a specific real-world problem or need (N-rw); it then seamlessly transitions into the corresponding gap in scientific knowledge (N-sc), and finally offers a highly specific item of scientific knowledge (T-sc) that will serve as basis for formulating the overall Goal (G) of the proposal. The remainder of the abstract then becomes prototypical, with G followed by M and finally B. In this pattern, the gradual development of Territory and Niche over several cycles allows the author to draw on a sequence of real-world problems and ongoing scientific development and to, crucially, present the latter as coming to the aid of the former.

The present study further operationalizes Connor’s (2000) model to suggest that when authors employ a ‘real-world’ oriented cycle (Trw-Nrw), they do so in an initial position and then immediately transition to a closely related scienceoriented cycle (Tsc-Nsc). Taking into account both Connor’s (2000) distinction between real-world oriented and scienceoriented (T) and (N) moves and Feng and Shi’s (2004) rationale for “spiral” $( \mathsf { T } + \mathsf { N } )$ cycles within the science-oriented column, we can articulate the various moves, orientations and cycles into a single flow diagram, such as the one shown in Fig. 5.

This diagram represents Connor’s twin ‘real-world’ and science orientations for the (T) and (N) moves in vertical columns. A grant proposal writer can choose to start the abstract in the real-world column before moving over to the corresponding science-oriented (T) or (N) move. Alternatively, another writer might opt to concatenate several $( \mathsf { T } + \mathsf { N } )$ cycles within the science-oriented column. Additionally, those writers who started with ‘real-world’ oriented (T) and (N) moves often return to this column at the end of the abstract by detailing first Benefits to science (B-sc) and then finally Benefits to the real world’ (Brw). Fig. 6 illustrates such a return to a ‘real-world’ orientation in the final lines of the Biology abstract introduced earlier.

# 4.3. Variations involving the goal (G) move

While variations in the early parts of abstracts revolve around T-N cycles, variations in the latter parts of abstracts tend to involve the Goal (G) move and its unique ability to occupy different positions within an otherwise prototypical movestructure. Here I will discuss three specific phenomena, namely G-fronting, M-G inversions, and G-B combinations, which allow the grant proposal writer to either give prominence to the Goal move or to emphasize another move’s close association with the Goal move.

G-fronting is defined here as opening the abstract with the Goal (G) move, a practice that was found only in three New Zealand exemplars (see Table 6). However, it reproduces a similar pattern commonly found in RA abstracts; Hyland (2004), for example, noted that $3 8 \%$ of the RA abstracts in his corpus opened with what he termed the Purpose move. The rhetorical function of G-fronting in grant proposal abstracts is that it allows the Goal move to occupy the prime ‘real estate’ of the opening sentence, which generates an immediate ‘news’ impact and projects confidence in the author’s authority as a researcher. Fig. 7 shows an Engineering abstract from New Zealand featuring such a fronted Goal (G) move.

This abstract illustrates both the rhetorical impact and the added complexity introduced by G-fronting. First, the overall Goal (G) is placed in the opening sentence by means of a grand, eye-catching formulation (“We aim to rethink x”), which also delineates the topic and guides the reader through the following Territory (T) and Niche (N) moves. Because the Goal has already been fronted, the abstract then needs to transition directly from (N) to the Means (M) move, which it achieves by echoing the fronted “to improve” with “we will take three main paths to improvement”, thereby repairing the absence of the Goal move from its prototypical location between (N) and (M), while avoiding any lengthy repetitions. Similarly, the Goal move is again echoed at the start of the final Benefits (B) move (“This new actuator design approach …“). In summary, even though the Goal move itself has been fronted, the author has carefully left traces of it behind to introduce both the Means and Benefits moves.

The Goal (G) move can also be combined into a single sentence with either the Means (M) or the Benefits (B) move to achieve certain rhetorical effects. The first of these patterns is best described as an M-G inversion and can be found in several of the New Zealand abstracts. Here, the description of the materials and methods to be employed in the project is minimized to play a mere supporting role in presenting the overall Goal. Fig. 8 shows an Earth Sciences abstract featuring such an M-G inversion.

This abstract is near-prototypical, with the M-G inversion being the only varying element. A common feature in this pattern is that the inverted sequence of M and G is merged into a single sentence; in this exemplar the entire Means move has been reduced to a brief non-finite clause (“By exploiting x and y …“) which introduces the much more detailed Goal move. The advantage of inverting the prototypical move sequence and reducing the Means move in such a way seems to be two-fold: first, it allows the author to omit any technical methodological details from the abstract and merely “insinuate the appropriacy of the technique” (Hyland, 2004, p. 73) to the stated Goal. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it allows the Goal move to then flow directly into the final-position Benefits move, a combination that serves to highlight the utility of the proposal.

Whereas M-G inversions are employed as a useful strategy to minimize the length or importance given to the Means move, the alternative pattern of combining the Goal move and the Benefits move into a single sentence pursues the opposite aim, in that it frees up the final position of the abstract for a lengthy discussion of the materials and methods to be employed in the study. Such G-B combinations were observed in both New Zealand and Chilean abstracts; Fig. 9 shows an Earth Science abstract featuring such a G-B combination with final-position M.

This abstract is again near-prototypical, with the only notable variation being the G-B combination that allows for a finalposition M. The pattern is characterized by a clearly signaled Goal move (“The overarching goal of this project is …“) which is immediately followed by a Benefits move that has been reduced to a to-infinite clause (“to improve forecasts …“). The overall Goal move is then echoed (i.e., repeated in simplified form) to introduce the lengthy and detailed final-position Means (M) move. In short, the desired final position and extension of M is not achieved by omitting the Benefits move but instead by attaching B to the earlier G, and then ‘repairing’ the modified move sequence by echoing G at the start of M. Overall, such variations with final-position M appear to be particularly useful for proposals that focus on an improvement in methods (e.g., the modelling of sea ice in the Earth Sciences abstract shown above in Fig. 9). A further example employing this pattern, namely an Engineering abstract from Chile (Appendix D), is presented in the supplementary materials.

The three patterns observed here (G-fronting, M-G inversion, and G-B combination) illustrate the central organizing role of the Goal move and its unique ability to recombine with other elements of the abstract. The Gap (G), Means (M) and Benefits (B) moves will rarely communicate directly with each other and instead function as contributors towards the understanding and valuation of the overall goal of the grant proposal. In short, these other moves rely on the Goal move to provide the essential connections to link them together. Fig. 10 provides a schematic illustration of the central role of the Goal (G) move in the rhetorical connections between moves.

While this central role of the Goal move is simple enough to represent as a two-dimensional figure, it causes an important dilemma for the grant writer. In the linear form of textual structures, the Goal move can only be employed once for maximum effect. The moves that immediately precede or follow the Goal move will benefit from this explicit association, while other moves that are further removed will see their rhetorical effect diminished. The example abstracts analyzed here suggest that writers will attempt to resolve this problem by “echoing” the Goal move at the beginning of later moves with additional shorthand repetitions of the Goal, especially in instances where the chosen move sequence diverges from the prototypical pattern.

# 4.4. Similarities and differences between disciplinary and national settings

The present study did not set out to compare the rhetorical moves found in the four disciplinary or the two national settings; however, the observed patterns suggest more similarities than differences in their respective move structures. Firstly, researchers from all four disciplines (Biological Sciences, Earth Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics) all made use of the same move-structure framework and prototypical pattern; the identified variations were also distributed through the studied disciplines. This was somewhat unexpected, especially because the discipline of Mathematics is often said to follow different argument structures (Kuteeva & McGrath, 2015).

Secondly, few differences were found between the two national settings. Grant proposal abstracts from Chile employed the same prototypical move-structure pattern as their New Zealand counterparts and engaged in similar T-N cycles; the only notable difference found was that the Chilean abstracts employed fewer variations involving the Goal (G) move, and in particular did not perform any G-fronting. It may well be that grant writers express their conformity to local needs and their membership in local communities not at the level of moves structures, but instead in their lexico-grammatical choices and in their often localized research topics. Examples of the such strategies can be found in several of the abstracts shown here, such as the benefit of establishing “a New Zealand-based global research network” (Fig. 2) or the goal of identifying pressure deviations “in the metamorphic rocks of the Chilean coast” (Fig. 3). Several factors may help account for this similarity in structures between disciplinary and national settings, such as the persuasive nature of these grant proposal abstracts (Myers, 1990), their occluded nature (Swales, 1996, pp. 45e58), and the close constraints placed on them by granting agency guidelines (Tardy, 2003), although it is important to stress that neither the New Zealand or Chilean guidelines explicitly prescribed any of the moves or their order.

![](img/9e1b8e9466d447b0045938cbd5b225b162ad17a302695ae0fac83d7ff5d28bd5.jpg)  
Fig. 10. The central role of the Goal move.

Finally, it should be noted that some abstracts sourced from the Chilean setting showed evidence of non-canonical language (Rozycki & Johnson, 2013; Flowerdew, 2016), which is sometimes associated with ELF research writing products (see, e.g., “recent numerical modellings” in Fig. 3). However, similar structures were also found in some New Zealand abstracts, and particularly in one exemplar authored by a multilingual or EAL author (see, e.g. “their impact of the climate system”; “by analysing of a large number” in Fig. 9). This again reminds us that individual researchers do not necessarily represent all the sociolinguistic characteristics associated with their physical location (Perez-Llantada, 2012 ), and that, in science and engineering, ELF-type writing is increasingly finding tacit acceptance in at least some center-location genres.

# 5. Concluding remarks and future directions

The present study has built on existing descriptions of moves in grant proposal abstracts to describe and analyze how these individual moves come together to form a larger prototypical move-structure pattern, and how authors can introduce variations on these patterns for their own rhetorical purposes. After describing the existing literature on the genre analysis of grant proposals and grant proposal abstracts, this study introduced two settings for national research grant competitions, namely the New Zealand Marsden award, and the Chilean Fondecyt award. To prepare the move analysis of the 36 collected grant proposal abstracts, a framework of five constituent moves was formulated, and a prototypical move-structure pattern was identified and exemplified with abstracts from both settings and different science and engineering disciplines. Finally, two key variations on this prototypical pattern were described and analyzed, namely the inclusion of additional T-N cycles with either a real-world or science orientation, and the unique ability of the Goal move to shift position and to recombine with other moves for rhetorical purposes.

The main purpose of the present study has been to articulate into a single framework a number of existing definitions of moves, their preferred sequences, cycles of moves and their real-world or research orientation, and to explore the tension between prototypicality and variation in these patterns. As discussed earlier, other genres or part-genres are often described as having relatively stable and identifiable prototypical patterns, such as RA Introductions or Results and Discussion sections. In contrast, among existing studies of grant proposals and grant proposal abstracts, only Feng and Shi (2004) provide a numbering scheme for the moves and steps in their framework, noting however that only four out of nine grant proposal summaries follow their exact specified order, with various others displaying a similar phenomenon to what I have described as G-fronting here (see Table 3 in Feng & Shi, 2004), and calling for further research into variations in move sequences. The flow diagram presented here in Fig. 5 is a response to this need for a greater understanding of move-structure patterns in grant proposal abstracts, attempting to articulate the manifold variations expressed in move sequences, move cycling, and real-world versus research orientations (e.g., Connor & Mauranen, 1999; Feng & Shi, 2004; Flowerdew, 2016) into a single yet flexible framework.

Based on this flow diagram, the present study then explored the tension between prototypicality and variation in movestructure patterns, drawing on Swales’ (2004) characterization of genre as a frame for social action, of genre being “a starting place, an initial orientation” Swales (2004, p. 61). As noted earlier, only a few of the collected abstracts reproduce the prototypical pattern without any degree of variation in their move structures, whereas near-prototypical abstracts (i.e. abstracts showing a single point of variation) are much more prevalent. This suggests an image of a cluster of near-prototypical abstracts that all draw on an implied central prototypical pattern of the genre to situate their particular variation; they thereby collectively maintain and reinforce this prototypical pattern as a common reference even as they individually diverge from it for their own purposes.

Finally, grant proposal abstracts are typically addressed to a somewhat wider audience than other research products, which may, as Flowerdew (2016, p. 9) notes, lead authors to employ “more overt signaling for promotional purposes to convey a loud, clear and unambiguous message”. Being a persuasive and promissory high-stakes, occluded genre of strictly limited length, grant proposal abstracts seem therefore particularly well-suited to postgraduate writing courses modules or workshops. It is hoped that the move-structure framework, the prototypical pattern and its variations presented here may not only provide postgraduate students and novice scholars with a path towards analyzing and understanding existing exemplars but also with a framework to assist them with their own writing efforts.

# Appendix A. An additional prototypical abstract (New Zealand, Mathematics)

Note: This is a highly prototypical abstract, with each move presented once and in the expected sequence; each move is also clearly signaled by lexico-grammatical means. The only possible divergence from the prototype here is the somewhat vague realization of the overall Goal move (G), but this is well supplemented by the detailed surrounding moves.

# Appendix B. An additional prototypical abstract (Chile, Biology)

Note: This abstract is structured in the prototypical pattern, beginning with a relatively long and slowly progressing Territory (T) move, where a general topic is followed by recent advances in favor of a specific theory, and then a well-signaled transition to the Niche (N) move. After the brief Goal (G) and Means (M) moves, the abstract ends with the Benefits (B) move, which is further sequenced into benefits to science (sc) and to the real world (rw).

# Appendix C. An additional abstract featuring three T-N cycles (New Zealand, Engineering)

Note: The beginning of this abstract is particularly interesting, in that the move sequence alternates between establishing a Territory (T) and indicating a corresponding Niche (N) over three iterations of increasing specificity.

# Appendix D. An additional abstract featuring a G-B combination (Chile, Engineering)

Note: This abstract is near prototypical, in that the only variation of note is the placing of the Benefits move immediately after the Goal move, leaving the final position available for the Means move.
