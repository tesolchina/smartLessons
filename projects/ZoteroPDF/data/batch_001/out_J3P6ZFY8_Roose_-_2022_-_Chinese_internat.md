Chinese international students

While research on Academic Literacies has continued to develop, students' cultural and linguistic differences have only been superficially explored within this framework without consideration of their contribution to writers' practices, identities, and meaning-making processes. There is a need to continue extending the scope of this promising framework as both a pedagogical design frame and a logic of inquiry. To this end, this qualitative case study grounded in discourse analysis explores the writing moves Chinese international students make as they construct text meaning within the context of online discussions. This paper focuses on excerpts from two online discussion groups, including assignment prompts, news articles, student responses, and comments to one another within a university ESL Composition course in the U.S. An intertextual analysis suggests that when students socially interacted within online discussions in response to written texts and brought their perspectives and experiences into relationship with other writers' ideas, they took the opportunity to draw upon the dialogue and their own cultural knowledge and experience, positioning these as valuable sources in co-constructing the meaning of texts and negotiating their stances toward them.

# 1. Introduction

English for Academic Purposes (EAP) programs serve a key role in developing international students' academic writing skills yet little recognition is often given to how literacy practices and instional and disciplinary requirements . may be in conflict with students' identities and previous experiences" (Wingate & Tribble, 2012, p. 483). An emphasis on preparing students to meet the demands of their academic contexts may risk ignoring the valuable cultural resources they bring to the academy, leading to a loss f opportunities to build upon these assets as they acquire new academic sills. There is a great need toacknowledge the diversity and multiplicit of students prior and current literacy experiences" and encourage students to draw upon these as assets in ther second language writing development (Morton et l., 2015 p. 10). An Academic iteracies (Lea & Stret, 2006) framework may offer a more integrated approach that addresses the teaching and learning of academic practices taking place acrossthe university, while stil affirming students linguistic and cultural resources as egitimate tols fr aquring writing skils in the L omposition classroom (Lillis & Scott, 2007, p. 13).

# 1.1. Academic literacies

Lea and Street (2006) have sought an alternative to a deficit approach to academic writing that includes three overlapping perspectives: a study skills model, an academic socialization model, and their Academic Literacies model, which includes the first two but goes beyond them looking at how students writing is embedded within larger institutional power relations and practices (Lea & Street, 2006). Although academic literacie is a term frequently use by EAP practitioners, i is typically at the \*practical level of analyzing genres and discourses" rather than at the epistemological level of the Academic Literacies framework with literacy viewed as a social and ideological practice embedded in institutional practices and power relations (Blommaert et al., 2007). Moreover, the pluralistic concet of Aademic Literacies reflects stuents neowitch ther writing stles and gnre from one stting to another, to deploy a repertoiref litray prati ppropriat to each etting, and  hndle the socia menngs and dentitie ch oks (tt, 199, p. 233). Accordingly, the overall focus of Academic Literacies is on the wide range of language users situated practices-writers lived experiencesrather than simply their language use or text production; in other words, \*what it means to 'do' academic writing in different sites and contexts (Coffin & Donohue, 2012, p. 67). More specificlly, this social practice perspective of the teaching and learning of writing \*involves ways of reasoning, sharing ideas, expressing opinions, exploring perspectives, ..generating insights, establishing social relationships, expressing social identities, and using poken and written language" (Newell et al., 2015, p.17)

# 1.2. Purpose of the current study

Research on Academic Literacies has developed in recent decades; however, many scholars have pointed out that i has yet to be established into a "pedagogically useful framework" for the teaching of academic writing (Lillis, 2003; Tribble, 2015, p. 460) Consequently, Academic Literacies has been criticized for lacking real impact on currculum design, material development, and instructional practices (Trible, 2015). Nonetheless, there is great potential for Academic Literacies to be used as "a deign frame . to inform the theory and practice of student writing pedagogy" (Lills, 2003, p. 195). Despite these possbilitie, several scholars have noted that Academic Literacies research has paid littl attntion to the experience of international students (Coffin & Donohue, 2012; Wingate & Tribble, 2012), pointing to a need to extend the scope of this promising framework.

Moreover, Academic Literacies studies have almost exclusively focused on social interaction and dialogue between instructors and students regarding their experience with writing for assessment and gaps in expectations about writing requirements (Lea & Street, 1998, 2006; Lillis 2003, 2006). Minimal research has ooked at dialogue among students, and particularly within online learning components with the notable exception of Lea (2007). Additionall, online discussions are typically viewed only for their role in facilitatig social interaction rather than as significant academic texs part of students knowledge construction (Lea, 2007). Thus, the platorm of online discussions may be an optimal space to explore international students writing moves as they co-construct text meaning.

Furthermore, although Lea and Street (1998) have claimed Academic Literacies is a practices approach that takes account of the cultural and contextual component of writing and reading practices' (p. 158),students' cultural and ingustic ifferences have only been superficially mentioned across the iterature without exploring how they contribute to writers practices, identities, and meaning-making processe. Their cultural experiences and knowledge ought to be closely considered as they indeed matter within the inherent power structures of Academic Literaciesagap thistudy seeks to addres. root my understanding of the complex and highly contested concet of culture in Stree's (1993) discursive notion of culture deming this most compatible with an Academic Literacies approach given its focus on the wide range of language users situated practices. Stret (1993) has claimed culture should be denominalized and deconstructed to expose what culture do rather than what iti. Framing culture s verb, hetreats culture as the active construction of meaning (p. 23). Thus, rather than looking at culture as a fixed, static product based on racial or national boundaries, in this study, culture isviewed as a dynamic proces, and cultural resources the knowledge rooted in individuals' lived experiences.

This study contributes to the scholarship on Academic Literacies addressing its application as both a pedagogical design frame and logic of inquiry. It does so by exploring Chinese international students' engagement in one common academic writing practice in Western higher education institutes minimall ddressed in the Academic Literacies research-online discussions as an embedded component of a face-to-face course. More specifically, the following research questions guide this study:

1 How do Chinese international students use writing moves within online discussions to help them construct the meaning of texts? 2 How do Chinese international students use writing moves to consider their cultural experiences and knowledge related to news articles?

# 1.3. Brief review of relevant academic literacies studies

Goodfellow (2005) has argued texts generated in online discussions should be viewed from an Academic Literacies perspective as this academic writing is also shaped by power and authority, and this virtual space may provide students opportunity to resist dominant literacie as they develop their own modes of participation. Similarly, Huang and Archer (2017) have called for Academic Literacies research to move beyond traditional writing practices to account for writing in the digital age by including multimodal composition. They have clamed writing practices in higher education are changing due to the rise in digital technology, leading to different modes of communication. Most closely resembling the ams of this present study is Lea's (2007) exploration of online learning in higher education as she called attention tonline textual interactions as sites of academic writing (p. 80). In a case study of online writing, Lea looked at the communication as a process of knowledge construction by analyzing students' intertextual moves, metadiscoursal moves ofalignment and distance, and ownership of ideas and authority in their commitment to propositions. Ultimately, she claimed these online writings should be viewed as important in the process of knowledge construction as students work together to negotiate meaning within an institutionally significant space.

# 1.4. Academic literacies and online discussions

Online discussons, also known as "computer-mediated communication (e., Hirvela, 2006; Payne & Whitney, 2002), \*web-based bulletin board discussions" (e.g, Kamhi-Stein, 2000), and \*threaded discussions" (e.g, Weasenforth et al, 2002), have become an increasingly more common academic writing practice in Western universities. I have chosen the term \*online discussions' to emphasize the dialogic nature of this academic practice and how it may mirror discssons taking place i clsrooms as students figure things out together and work toward understanding through the use of language.

Online discussions give opportunity for students reluctant to speak up in clas to have a voice in the conversation and contribute to the learning (Bikowski & Kesser, 2002; Payne & Whitney, 2002). Through student dialogue, online discussions not only promote relationship building, but also play a productive role in cultivatig language learning asstudents can provide one another feedack and clarification (Weasenforth et l., 2002). They may produce more comple language in online discussions than face-to-face ones (Payne & Whitney, 2002) because increased time and space can offer them greater opportunity for reflection (Hirvela, 2006).In particular, electronic communication can create a positive "distancing efect" which lends itself to increased student empowerment and increased desire to expres oneself in the target language ecause the computer sems to minimize the risks involved in communication in a foreign language" (Hirvela, 2006, p. 234). Thus, students may experience reduced anxiet (Kamhi-Stein, 2000 and develop more positive attitudes toward the English language through online communicative opportunities (Payne & Whitney, 2002).

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Instructional context

This qualitative case study grounded in discourse analysis is part of a larger ongoing study of ES. Composition courses at alarge land-grant midwestern university in the United States (U.S.) recognized for its high international student enrollment (Institute of International Education, 2021). The data reported in ths study was drawn from one ESL Composition course offered in Autumn 2018 comprised of 19 Chinese international undergraduate student. Chinese constitute the highest population of study abroad students both in the U.S. and at this university (Enrollment Services Analys and Reporting, 2018; Institute of International Education, 2021).

Online Discussion Assignment Prompt

# Week 1 Guidelines

Each week you will respond to the reading assignment on the online discussion board. You should respond by Friday midnight with a 200-250 word response total for the two questions combined and then comment on two of your classmates' posts by Sunday midnight with a 50-100 word comment to each classmate. (Please include the word count in parentheses at the end of each post.)

# Week 1 Discussion Questions (Please respond to both)

1) Discuss the points you agree with, disagree with, and/or questions you have about the issues raised in this reading. You may also include other reactions you have like what surprised you, confused you, or impressed you in the news article.

2) Based on your personal experiences and knowledge, how might the issues explored in this news article look different in your home country's cultural context? For example, do you see cultural similarities or differences in the problem, solution, and/or perspectives presented in the text?

\*Please make meaningful connections to the readings in your response to the discussion questions to give evidence that you have read and related the ideas to your own.

Fig. 1. Online discussion assignment prompt.

Most students in these ESL Composition courses are freshmen pursuing various majors. Informal onversation suggests they come from diverse educational backgrounds with high school degrees from domestic and international schools in China, as well as different English-speaking countries.

The course is required for many international undergraduate students based on their ESL Composition placement test scores when entering the university. The test asesses students' familiarity with U.S. universt-level expectations for critical reading and using sources in academic writing. Thus, it isassumed students placed in the course need to acquire skill in summarizing, paraphrasing, crafting an argument, citing sources, etc. The course seems implicitly grounded in an EAP model largely reflecting an academic socialization approach, although this is my interpretation as a former instructor and not necessarily the program's intention. For instance, according to the syllabus, the course focuses on language strengthening in the context of writing with sources to support students' extensive practice with developing academic writing and research skills that willbe important throughout their undergraduate career.

At the time of the study, the course met face-to-face twice a week for 1 h and 20-min sessions. An online learning platform supplemented instruction and supported student learning engagement. Online and in-classcontent and instruction were pedagogically connected. As the instructor, I tuctured the course to be dialogic with instructional activities centered on social interaction and talk as students engaged with reading materials and in the academic practice of using textual sources and written responses. Online dis cussions were based on readings from National Public Radio (NPR) news articles chosen throughout the semester as thematic material for in-clas discussions to cultivate critical thinking and develop source-based writing skill, such as summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting, which were core objectives f the clas. In prearation fr in-class iscussions and lerning activitie, students participated in online discussions of different news articles. These online discussions focused on engaging with the text topics whereas in-class discussions focused on learning academic writing skill from these source texts. Students participated in these online discussions every week for the first seven weeks of the semester, and then students drew upon these texts and skill acquired engaging with them to generate topics and construct academic essays and presentations, the focus of the later half of the semester. Thus, these online discussions fit into the course's larger pedagogical infrastructure.

Online discussions represented $3 0 \%$ of students' grades. They were required to respond to weekly readings with 200-250 words total and comment on two classmates posts with 50-100 words each. Responses were posts in direct reaction to the originating news text, whereas comments were reactions to classmates'responses to these new texts. This online discussion component was included each semester, but in Autumn 2018 was reconstructed explicitly asking students to draw on their home cultural knowledge and experiences in order to connect their cultural identities with the curriculum as shown in Fig. 1 below. This pedagogical move was made to deliberately incorporate the prior experiences and knowledge students bring from other contexts to acquire les familiar literacy practices, reinforcing Street's (1993) perspective that culture is actively constructed by its users.

Although these were group discussions, they were graded individuall, and written feedback was iven on each student's critical thinking, organization, word choice, and syntax, but scored primarily on effort to engage with the reading texs and attempts to create dialogue with classmates. As instructor of the course, I gave individual written feedback through the learning platform, as well as verbal feedback to the whole group inclas, particularly guiding them on how to further the conversations through their comments on classmates' online posts aer quickly realizing that some students were critiquing one another's writing rather than responding to their ideas (Roose & Newell, 2020).

# 2.2. Data sources

The data sources were two NPR news articles and students' online discussions in response. I rovide description of the news artices from Week 1 and Week 7, along with rationale for this selection below. Afterwards, Iexplain how students engaged in weekly online discussions and justification for the groups of focus in this study.

# 2.2.1. News articles

For the reasons stated above, data for this study was drawn from 19 Chinese intenational undergraduate students enrolled in an Autumn 2018 course. Specificall, this study is based on intertextual analysis of two online discussions: the first and last of te se. mester. Week 1 Online Discussion of NPR news article "Are Helicopter Parents Ruining Summer Camp?" by Kamenetz (2007) focuses on the difficulty summer camp directors face trying to maintain a ban on cellphone use not because of resistance from campers and counselors, but instead, noncompliant parents accustomed to frequent connection with their children. Perspectives of directors, counselors, parents, and campers are shared within the news article offring various vantage points and opening the topic up for debate. This discssion was selected beause anedotal evidence suggest t may be diffiult fr intenational students to participate in classroom discussions on U.. centric topic, making obvious the value of providing them regular instructional support to engage in conversations by drawing upon the cultural resources they bring into the classoom. It was also the students' irst experience with online discussions in thecourse (and quite possibly at the university, suggesting the academic conventions of online discssions were likely unfamiliar to many students.

The last online iscussion occurred midway through the semester with Week 7 Online Discussion of NPR news article entitled \*To Focus on Students' Emotional Well-Being, India Tries Happiness Classes" by Bowman (2018). This article iscusses how the Delhi government inroduced \*happiness classes" to address public concerns over students mental health. The motivation behind this educational reform initiative and intended benefits of decreasing students stress anxiety, deression, and suicide rate are discussed from the perspectives of govenmet fficials, educators, and students. This discssion was selected beause took place in Week7,so students had several weeks of engagement with online discussions, and thus, increased familiarity with this academic convention.

Moreover, as opposed to the news article from Week 1 based on a U.S. centric topic, the news article in Week 7 was rooted in an international context, and one the students seemed to personall relate to more. Thus, the timing and text source content both made this a meaningful choice for further analysis of student engagement in online discussions in response to news articles.

# 2.2.2. Online written discussions

Each week students were randomly divided into several different discussion groups in Canvas, an online learning platform, and responses and comments from three students Liang, Xin, and Rong (references to allstudents in this paper are pseudonyms) in Week 1 Online Discussion Group B are the focus of the first phase of ths study. This group was selected because they showed the greatest amount of dialogism, engaging with the content of one another's responses, as opposed to other groups who frequently made eval. uative comments to one another's writing quality. Moreover, the students in Group B explitly drew on their cultural background multiple times in their discussin, making it a rich text to use for this study rooted in an Academic Literacie framework. The three members of Group B were in different groups in Week 7 based on randomized groupings. One focal student Liang, from the original discusson group in Week 1, and his new group members (Shuqiong, Han, Yanxi, and Junfei), were chosen for further analysis. These students in Group D were selected because they made the most dialectical moves, showing divided reactions to both the text and their classmates' responses, making it compelling to analyze in relation to studying academic writing as a social practice.

# 2.3. Data analysis procedures

Analysis of Week 1 Online Discussion included 11 language excerpts: the assignment prompt, news article, three student responses, and six student comments. The thre student responses totaled 653 words with an average of 217.67 words per response, and comments totaled 422 words with an average of 70.33 words per comment. Analysis of Week 7 Online Discussion included 17 language excerpts: the assignment prompt, news article, five student responses, and ten student comments. The five student responses totaled 1149 words with an average of 229.8 words per response, and comments totaled 587 words with an average 58.7 words per comment. In total, this study includes 28 language excerpts, with 2811 words of student writing (responses and comments combined.

Intertextual analysis (Bazerman, 2004) was conducted in various ways to examine the moves students make in relation to one another as they make connections between texts and act and react to one another. Moves refer to actions people take in writing to get work done" (VanDerHeide, 2017, p. 3), and intertextual analysis llows researchers to analyze how writers put \*words together in new ways to fit [their] specific situation, needs, and purposes" (Bazerman, 2004, p. 83). In this study, writing moves refer to actions students take in online discussions to co-construct the meaning of texts and negotiate thir stances toward them. Various types of writing moves are specified and illustrated in the data analysis procedures as follows.

Week 1 and Week 7 Online Discussions were analyzed sentence by sentence reflecting the boundaries students chose to communicate their ideas to readers. Initially, online discussion data was coded to capture connections between students' responses and comments by color-coding sources and drawing lines between texts to reflect dialogism (Appendix A, Figure A1). Analyzing connections between texts, I was able to understand how students use words and position themselves in relation to multiple texts (Bazerman, 2004).

Wynhoff Olsen et al. (2018) define intertxtual connections as the \*actions writers make to insert a previous text into a new text" (p. 62). Drawing upon their analytic approach, I then further examined students' responses and comments for thematic and lexical intertextual traces of the originating news artices and their clasmates posts I considered it a thematic trace when students borrowed an idea, topic, or content from another text (e., the originating news texts or those students produced in the online discussions) and a lexical trace when they borrowed a word or word phrase from these text (p. 6). Then I reanalyzed these traces to see how students made intertextual moves through (1) repeating previous texts, (2) responding to them, and (3) extending them with new ideas (Appendix A, Table A1). Repeating happens when writers quote, paraphrase, or summarize ideas, words, or phrases maintaining them rather than developing them further. Responding happens when writers interact with previous text s a way of engaging in an ongoing conversation. Extending occurs when writers develop themes or lexicon to create something new (p. 66). These intertextual moves helped to lluminate "what people do with and through writing and how social relationships are created and sustained through in tertextuality" (Wynhoff Olsen et al., 2018, p. 84).

To further explore the moves students made in these online discussions, I identified moments when students expressed agreement and disagreement to see how they negotiated text meaning and shared their diffrent viewpoints. Agreement to various degrees was identified through exresions sch s I age wth you ply agee/ totlly aee/m totll n amentt s so rue/ is a ood idea/It i a good thing. Likwise, diagrement was idenified through negating expressions such as  disagre with t/ didn ee ny difference/I really do not think," and syntactical features such as conjunctions and adverbs demonstrating contrast and alternative perspectives, such as "but/although/however/instead."

Furthermore, to complexify the analysis of how students negotiated meaning, expressed their viewpoints and engaged with one another as members of these online discussion groups, I drew upon Hyland's (2005) approach to metadiscourse analysis. His inter actional dimension of discourse seemed particularly relevant for the analysis of online discussions as the \*metadiscourse here is essentially evaluative and engaging, expressing solidarit, anticipating objections, and responding to an imagined dialogue with others" (pp. 49-50). The interactional dimension of discourse rfers to the ways writers make their views explicit expresstheir textual 'voice, convey judgments, and (dis)align themselves from their readers. In particular, this type of discourse is expressed through interactional resource, including hedges, boosters, atitude markers, self-mentions, and engagement markrs all of which helped to complexify the analysis of students' stancetaking in their online discussions (Appendix A, Table A2).

Lastly, I also identified instances when students made intercontextual references to past or future events outside of their immediate context (Bome et al. 205) by drawing upon their cultural knowledge and experiences. More specificall, intrcontextual references were identified when students made personal claims that cultural similarities and differences existd in relation to the originating news articles. hee cultl similrities we idntfied through explicit phase uch as  didnt see ay diffeence betwethe ctures on these stuations" and In China, the situation is the same," and other more implicit ones, such as In China, the competition is also very intense," and "Just like what happened in China ..." (emphasis added).

Likewise cultural dfferences were identified through several explicit expresions such as A difference between China and America appears here .., "However, unlike American parents, for Chinese parents ..,' and "'One thing I find somewhat different from my country ... These intercontextual references complemented the intertextual analysis because they point to actions writers may take to go outside of originating texts as they engage with them.

# 2.4. Findings and interpretations

The findings and interpretations from Week 1 and Week 7 Online Discussions will now be explored according to the two central research questions and situated within an Academic Literacie framework. Findings from Week 1 Online Discussion have be reported previously in a preliminary study (Roose & Newel, 2020), but the analysis here has been expanded and new insights have emerged.

# 2.4.1. Negotiating multiple viewpoints, Co-Constructing meaning

To address the first research question, Iexamined how international students writing moves helped them construct and contest the meaning of the text. Findings revealed dialogism (Bakhtin 1981) occurred through the negotiation of viewpoints between several different writers on multiple levels throughout the online discussion. Students intractio with the news article and post of thr peers underscores writing as a social practice where students co-construct meaning (Lea & Street, 2006).

First, students interacted with various perspectives voiced in the news article and negotiated their stances in relation to one another through agreement and disagreement with specific points raised in the texts. For example, Rong begins his response summarizing the news article, \*the article mainly talks about the advantages and disadvantages about using phones on summer camps when there are helicopter parents. He then goes beyond repeating text ideas to responding tothem expresing agrement with perspectives voiced in the news article, \*children willbe more activate active] and easily make new friends without phones. These ideas can be losely tied back to the news article where activities such as swim[ming] in the lake" and building friendships" are mentioned. Rong then extend these ideas by elaborating on his stance against phone use t camp: \*Without phones, children can better practice their communication ability instead of watching YouTube that can neither mprove their ability nor give their happiness. He then identifies tension within this position partially greing with a contrary perspective voiced in the text: However, using phones can help parents know if her children are in some danger or share the happinessof their children have. This can be thematically traced back to the news article as parents voice concerns such as, "Are they OK? Were they sent to the hospital? I can't reach my child, they haven't texted yet to say they're safe." Rong continues to adjust his position on cellphone use as he considers the parents' perspective: "Since it i the parents instinct to care about their children, there are no exactly true or false on these questions. He eventually takes  more moderate stance suggesting, \*children should learn how to use their phones properly so they can make knew [new] friends, practice their commun. cation ability, and also let their parents fel relieved. This final position shows thematic tracing of several ideas found in the news article and demonstrates he has considered various perspectives of diffrent stakeholders as he negotiates his own position.

Second, students not only expressed agreement and disagreement with perspectives within the source text but also within their classmates' responses. Different dgree of grement wth one anothr were ignaled through afirmative phrase, such as "I agree with the idea that, t iso rue that nd totll gee. Their disagrement was indicated es emotively through conrasting words such as \*although" and however." A prime exampleofthis is the lexical tracing of proper phone use in thefollowing conversation unfolding between students. Rong expresses his position on the cellphone policy repeating phrases from the originating source text, namely incoporating adirct quote: ts nsary to lt childr s th phons inrope way, s sthefather d, just be awareof when you're using it" (emphasis added). This same lexical tracing emeres in Liang's comment: I agree with the point that children should learn how to use their phone properly." In this way, Liang repeats prior phrases and identifies a point agrement with Rong, but then he qualifies this agrement taking an evaluative stance: \*However, lots of tenagers do not have enough self-ontrol to do so. As a result they need some external factor lik teachers and parents to help them keep away from the phones. Thus, he responds and moves the conversation forward extending the ideas through consideration of an opposing position and providing rationale for his own.

# 2.4.2. Making moves: stancetaking through dialecticism

In Week 7 Online Discussin, I loked again at how international students' writing moves helped them contestext meaning and negotiate their stances toward it. Interestingly, findings revealed much more dialecticism than in the first discussion, as students responses to the news article were marked by stronger critique and more divided reaction.

First, Liang (the focal participant) is highly critical of the idea that happiness casses could benefit students. After briefly sum. marizing the news article (i.e., repeating), he quickly responds and extends this idea taking a strong personal stance against it:

I reall do not think this kind of class can be succes in India.As we all know, Indian contain 1.2 bllion people which means that the competition in India is significantly difficult. Because the number of jobs is way lower than the population in India (emphasis added).

His use ofthe booster \*eally andengagment marker as we l know" mphasize his certainty n his position and his ttempt t tablish authority in his textual voice. He sets up an argument taken up by others that the gap between the high population and limited employment opportunities in India makes happines classes unsuitable or preparing students fr successin a competitive society.

Shugiong enters the conversation first establishing a relationship with Liang (the first writer and now intended reader) She affirms his response and articulates greement with his central argument that happines classes would not solve the root of the problem: You explain the main rason of students stress wll I'm gree with you that the causation of their stess remains and could be impossible to solve. Students frequently make this move as they explicitly refer to one another and tend to respond with partial agrement before they articulate their own positions; i other words, they seem to seek harmony and unity before introducing any conflic. In this way, Shuqiong goes on to repond sharing her own vantage point that iffers from Liang's strong oppositional stance: \*But f the program of happiness clas could hae a tte it of ffet on relieving ther strs then it should e ecouragd. en thogh the crl problem remains, we should always think about ways to relieve." Although Shuqiong claims that the \*idea of happiness cass s a good idea," she raises new concerns: however I'm holding a skeptical attitude towards it. Is it rally beneficial for children or is it just a formalistic action? I hope they do this for the mental health of children, not a superficial comfort." Using a hypothetical question to engage her readers as participants in the conversation allows her to question the moties of the educational reform. She alo extends this argument bringing additional ssues to consider when evaluating the happinessclasses, such as wealth gaps and socioeconomic disparities in education: I also hope this program could benefit students living in all kinds of areas, not only for the richer areas."

Han now enters the discussion expressing agreement with ideas previously set forth claiming \*the happines course may not be effectie inredcing stdents stres bause stdnts have to face the comptitions sooner r later e nonthes rponds, since it is an innovated proramme,  hold the opnion that it i ance ty n reucing stdents stses" (mphis added). The phrase " nice try' is taken up in various ways by other students in the discussion to qualify their positions when they critique India's education initiative. Yanxi's comment shows multiple leical and thematic traces of prior statements: "I totall agre with your opinion that the roo reason of the intense compttion i the large populatio .. Theefore, the happines course in India is a ood try to help students get a little rlief (emphasis added). He communicates certainty and solidarity in his position through the oster \*totally" and his estatement (reeating) f former arguments made. Also, as can be see,\*a nice ry" now appears as aood try" and is ate revoiced by other students as "a good beginning" and "a good start."

In fact, Liang (the focal participant), who initilly took a strong stance against happiness classes, now modifies his position acknowledging that students may feel incresingly high levels of pressure and may benefit en if marginall from happines courses. He states: I think i's a good thing for government to realized the necessit of students mental health, and setting up a happiness course is also a good y mphasis added). He makes textal reference to the news article again as he explains the happiness ourse could release students from their busy schoolwork even if only have $3 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and offering them a personal space to thinking." He extends this argument providing an example: "afer students calm down they might even be more eficiency than before." He seems to renegotiate his stance alluding to prior concerns raised but ultimately asserting that the educational initiative, while not a proper solution, may be a starting point for reform: \*Although, it will be much better if thereare some comprehensive ways, the happiness' course is a good beginning of this long journey" (emphasis added).

Junfei is the last student to enter the discussion. He, like others, begins with agreement repeating details from the news article brought up earlier: \*the happines clas only take about 35 min" but could \*relax the mentality of students grely. He provides further rationale and extends the conversation by directly quoting the news article: \*More seriously, students in India have a high suicide rate and educators have seen the mental health consequence (Bowman, 2018, p. 2)." He also incorporates a new perspective from the originating source, a 7th grader quoted saying, \*'We should work hapily .. when you work sadly, your work will not be good." Through explicit reference to himself and his position he states: "From my perspective, this kind of innovation is a good try in edu. cation, and i ems to have positie effcts on kids mphis added). Heultimatly qualifie his tance ting the happiness courses may be \*more accessible for young kids because they need to have consistent interest in study for the future." In this way, he supports the happines courses but clams they are more appropriate for younger than older children. Yanxi, however, disagrees with this new point raised although he makes sure to maintain the relationship first by complimenting Junfei's perspective as "persuasive" and "interesting. Then he moves toward responding with disagreement as he believes happiness classes should not be age-dependent "However, I think everyone who is undertaking a huge pressure needs a happines course' in order to keep mental health." Thus, students make many complex moves as they expressagreement and disagreement with the news article and one another's responses to it. As they do this, they develop language to express their stances and construct social relations through these rhetorical moves.

# 2.4.3. Doing the dialogic through cultural comparison

To addres the second research question, I looked at what happens when international students draw upon the resources they bring into the academy (Lilli & Scott, 2007), namely their cultural experiences and knowledge, to make meaning of the texts they read. I found in Week 1 online dscussion students responded to the curricular adjustment made to this assigment in very meaningful ways as they incorporated their cultural knowledge to analyze the text and connected this literacy event to other events in their lives. For example, Liang claims Chinese parents are "unlike the American parents" who send their children to summer camp and then give their children a mobile phone to ease their fear. He explains Chinese parents typicall tust teachers more than their children," and they tend to send their children to school rather than camp during the summer. There i evidence of ubstantial thematic tracing here as the efforts of American parents to get phones to their children at camp are voiced in the news article: Parents will give their children a decoy to turn in and a second phone to keep hidden," ad  few years ago, an 11-ear-old was sent a cllphone in a care package. This intertextual connection allows Liang to claim key cultural diffrences in parents' behavior toward those in authority and helps him extend the conversation adding new ideas from beyond the text.

Xin and Rong both initilly agree with Liang about this cultural difference. Through lexica tracing, Xin repeats phrases from Liang and corroborates his perspective providing details to explain the rationale behind Chinee parents position and extends this point with

his own example:

I couldn't agree with you more. Chinese parents prefer to trust teachers, while American parents prefer to trust their children. A lot of Chinese parents think that teachers are more trustworthy than children. My example is that Chinese parents seldom ask children about exam performances of the whole class. Instead, they would like to choose to ask teachers directly.

Iowever, Rong identifies a disagrement with part of Liangsargument: \*lthough Chinese parents want their children to have classes t the vocation [vacation to get a good grade, they willalso send ther children to join the camp because ther also want their children o be self-dependent." Despite many points of cultural difference raised by students, Rong disagrees and responds:

I didn't see any difference between the two cultures on these situations, because parents' love to their children are same allover the world. Parents always worry about their children and want to know how they live, whether their children are happy, or if their children have got hurt.

here are lexical traces here to the news article where parents voiced concerns about their children being in danger at camp. Rong rivileges the concerns of parents over the camp directors and campers, and in doing so, universlizes their experience and challenges is classmates' appraisal of cultural differences.

Interestingly, the majority of intertextual traces between students texts are in response to their peers' discussion of cultural similarities and differences, rather than interretations of thetx itef or positions taken on the entral deate of th text. By collectively reflecting on how the isues and perspecties presented in the news article were similar to or different from their lived cultural expe. riences and understandings in ther homecountry, stdents ncorporated tside sources tongage with the tex topic and construct thir responses to it. From a discursive perspective of culture, students negotiate their different experiences in light of the articles.

# 2.4.4. Challenging and critiquing through cultural resources

In Week 7 news article, I also looked at what happens when international students draw upon their cultural resources (e.g., the knowledge rooted in individuals' lived experiences) to make meaning of the texts they read. As this was specified in the assignment task, what is most important to note is notthat the students did this but how they did it. Interestingly, this news article was situated in an international context to which students articulated greater cultural similarity than the U.S. context in the first discussion. This perceived cultural similarity appeared to provide students greater opportunity to establish authorial voices and evidence greater analytical ability drawing upon a seemingly deer understanding of the educational context. More specificall, they critiqued the feasibility and appropriateness of the happiness clases as a proposed solution to the mental health ssues students fce in a highly populated, intensely competitive society by drawing upon their cultural knowledge and lived experiences.

Early in the discussion, Liang (the focal participant) employs Chinese saying to support his position that hard work and study, not happiness, ar eential for ultimate success i ife, forming the basis of his citique f the hppiness courses. He explains, In China there is a saying that i you do not work hard when you are young, the only thing you can do after you grown up iskeeping in sadness." Speaking directly to the reader, he conveys a sense of authority and certainty in his voice:

If you want to be succes in such a competitive environment, you can hardly be happy or comfortable unles you are a genius. Consequently, if you are in an education system which pay more attention on if you are happy or not, you can barely win when compete with people who work hard. As a result, you may be poor, busy, and hard to live. (emphasis added) His word choices hardly" and barely" emphasize his certainty in his postion. lso, his cause-efect language consequently and "as a result" are strategically used to express the logic of his argument. Liang, as others do later as well, xplicitly aserts understanding of the Indian educational context based on his lived experiences in China:

In China, the situation is the same. Children have tostudy as hard as they can just for gakao' which is the test after graduating from senior high school. And according to the grade they receive, they wil be divided into different university. People graduate from better university can have better opportunity when finding jobs.

n doing so, he explains his perspective on the Chinese educational context and provides justification for the value of hard work andth mplications of this in Chinese society, and by comparison, implies this would be true for the Indian context as well.

Likewise, Shuqiong claims similarity between the cultural contexts roted in their competitive environments and uses this to question the underlying motie ofth happiness cass. She assers, In China, the comption is aory inense. In ddressing her initial skepticism of the educational reform, she explains, From my own biased perspective, some of these kind of programs with beautiful slogans such as benefit for student' are just shows." She provides details to clarify:

Some people take advantages of these program by counting these as their achievements to be promoted. Some people look for opportunitie to take money from these programs. They never really care about students. They only troubles students and waste their time.

Furthermore, Shuqiong uses her position as a student to establish an authorial voice:

Actually, as a student, sometimes I really don't want any change even though some program's purpose are really good. I think it's useles most of the time because it never solve my real problem-I need good grades to enter good universities to find good jobs in the future.

hese concerns echo those raised by Liang above and are central arguments against happines classes brought up by student epeatedly throughout the discussion.

As others have done prior in the discussion, Yanxi draws a parallelbetween China and India's educational contexts and uses these points of similarity to discus the ifficulties of being a student in a highly competitive society with a large population. He states, Just like what happened in China, students be highly concentrate in their schoolwork even since kindergarten because they faced many competitors." Liang extends this point bringing in standardized tests (contextual information provided in the news article):

The same things also happened in China. As a country contained a huge population, standardized test is also the only choice for most of students. With the growing up of children, they undertaken more and more pressure from school and parents. Whereas these students provide many arguments against happiness clases based on perceived cultural similarit, Junfei draws upon his cultural experiences to support the value of happiness classes:

When I was in high school, I had many classes each day, and there was a huge amount of homework at that time. In order to have a good grade in all my subjects, I had to stay up til midnight. I was lack of sleep and stressed out. He also incorporates specificultural knowledge based on his regional context t elaborate upon the pressure and stres students face.

In my home town Zhengzhou, the pressure of competing for better education is much more fierce than all ther provinces. In light of that my hometown holds most population of all provinces and there is only 1 university that can be ranked 211' universities, so it the only chance for you to get into a excellent college is always be better than your mates.

These supporting detail allow Junfei to elaborate on how his personal experiences reflect the difficultie students face. He then hypothesizes the possible benefits happiness casses could have afforded him in his academic journey: \*What if my high school had such a course to learn happines, I would be etter to manage my stres in my high school." He quickly considers an alternative angle though exhibiting emerging analytical skillfulness:

However, on the other side, the learning experience in high school really help me a lot in adapting the life in universty. For instance, I am able to manage my time and I have many suitable studying methods which I developed in the high school.

In many ways, students drew upon cultural resources, their experiences in China, to make their views explicit and align and disalign themselves with othersultimately, extending the onversations with these new ideas and guiding ther co-construction of the meaning of the texts (Hyland, 2005). It i true that participants often invoked nationalistic notions of culture in their iscourse of "American? and \*Chinese culture, but it i also true that they contest esentilizing these cultures by raising disgrements with their pers based on regional differences and their varied personal experiences.

# 3. Conclusions

In this study, I have explored the writing moves Chinese international students make as they co-construct text meaning in online discussions. This study makes smallstrides in addressing gaps in the Academic iteracies scholarship by focusing on (a) international students, (b) their daloge with peers t instructors, c) within onlin discussions, andd)how they draw uponultural knowledge and experiences avaluable ource i their writig The gol is not to make genelizations from hismallsample and daaet but t suggest some tentative theoretical claims. The studys findings lend support to the notion that reading texs and writig about them is socially constructed process of people interacting with each other and multiple texts" (Bloome et al., 2018, p. 254). The findings also may challenge normative understandings of source-based writing. Instead of predominantly an individual cognitive activity that is text-based these students drew upon multipl source eyond the source text to make meaning, including ther prior experiences andthe texts produced in these online discussions. In these ways, both intertextualit (Bazerman, 2004) and intercontextuality (Blome et al. 2005) semed to play central role in students' analysis of the texts as the dialogue moved beyond the immediat text and social event

Previous work in Academic Literacies has made minimal rference to students' use of cultural resources, but this study highlights how well students responded to curricular adjustments asking them todraw upon prior experiences and knowledge rooted in ther home cultural ontext to engage with texts and write about them through online discussions with peers. Given that his was part of the assignment guidelines, students likely had instrumental motivation to do so. However, students appeared to welcome the opportunity to bring their cultural resources into encounters with academic literacy and this supported their development as readers and writers. It seems when the students entered into online discussions in response to written texs and brought their cultural knowledge and ex periences into relationship with other writers ideas, they contested the meaning of texts and negotiated their stances toward them. This is evidenced by their consideration of various perspectives within the texts and outside of them, rationale for their own positions and response to opposing ones, as well s connections made between the texts and their own lies. This view of Academic Literacies pushes back against one-way socialization and instead embraces the idea of students as knowledge makers,constructors of meaning. They took the opportunity this assignment afforded to draw upon the dialogue and their own cultural knowledge, positioning these as valuable sources in co-constructing the meaning of texts and negotiating their stances toward them. Within the tensions in their social interactions and dialogue, students contested the meaning of texts and their responses to them. This hapened not in spite of their cultural backgrounds but because of the valuable knowledge and experience they brought to the texts. In other words, the course reconstruction may have released students into writing in a way that might otherwise not have occurred.

# 3.1. Future research

This study has focused exclusively on intertextual analysis of online discussions, but future research could ook more closely tthis component within its larger instructional context to trace transfer of learning and changes over time, along with students' emic perspectives of this literacy practice (Bloommaert et al., 2007; Coffin & Donohue, 2012). Additionall, VanDerHeide (2018) has suggested, it may be that students partcipate in classroom tal, they intenalize the ways they participate--the moves that they make-- and can then act in these same ways on their own, such as in their writing" (p. 4-5). It seems equally plausible students writing moves in online discussions might inform classroom talk, which anecdotal evidence as the instructor of this course suggests. Thus, a promising line of reearch may be to look more closely at the bidirectional relationship between academic talk and academic writing. For instance, in this course the online and in-clas content and instruction were pedagogicall connected throughout the semester; each likely shaped the participation patterns of the other. In other words, students were learning new ways to talk through writing and new ways to write through talking.

# 3.2. Pedagogical implications

This study rooted in an Academic Literacies framework has meaningful implications for the teaching and learning of writing as a social practice. Online discussions can do more than simply facilitat social interaction; they can become significant aademic texts in students' knowledge construction (Lea, 2007). Instead of "reading and writing in solitude," students can co-construct text meaning through participating in online discussions (Hirvela, 2007, p. 40). In this context, students' pers are positioned as their primary audience rather the instructor, which may heighten the dialogic nature and meaningfulness of these written texts. Moreover, participating in each online discussion over several days can provide students greater time for individual reflction and classroom collaboration (Hirvela, 2006). Online discussions also provide writen record of students' dialogue and can serve as "valuable scaffolding for further writing" (Hirvela, 2007, p. 53), as was the case in this classince these online discussions were used as thematic material to learn academic writing sills in class on a weekly basis and students were encouraged to return to them to generate material for academic essays during the second half of the semester. The online discussions also incorporated digital literacy and engagement with authentic materials, as well as required students to evaluate texts for a communicative purpose with a real audience (their peers). Thus, thee short informal piees of writing can help foster students' development as writers as they can strengthen their analytical skills and audience awareness, supporting their overall language acquisition and literacy development.

Moreover, online discussions can provide space for students to \*participate in social action to achieve particular goals through making moves" (VanDerHeide, 2017, p. 5). Students' engagement in these online discussions suggest they were learning to make writing moves through social interaction with one another. The meanings they constructed of the texts and their stances toward them were not stagnant Small changes were evident in their witing moves as their conversations unfolded with a progression from repeating (e.g., summarizing the source text ideas) to responding e.., agreing or disagreeing with stances in the text and those of ther peers) to extending (e.g., providing new ideas from the texts and their own lives to justif stances). Through dialogue in this online discussion space, students seemed to be larning how to justify and qualif the positions they took in response to the text topics. Considering his finding, instructors should pay atention to what is happening in online discussions and bring these writing moves to students awareness, encouraging them to pply thm  ther writing tass and contexts. Through this dialogic proces, they can also uild upon What students are already doing and scaffold these writing moves and others into their instruction. (For example, these students primarilycritiqued the texts based on their own lived experiences. This is valuable starting point, but instructors could help students move toward evaluating source texts based on the quality of their arguments, warranting, evidence, etc.). Through a social practice perspective of writing, instructors can provide students ample opportunity to acquire writing sills by engaging in dialogue with peers and drawing upon their cultural knowledge and experience as valuable sources in the meaning-making proces. When instructors intentionally design curriculum to incorporate students' cultural resources, this can increase their authorial voices as multilingual writers and their overall personal investment in their learning as it validates students background knowledge in the service of learning new academic skills that can transfer to future courses and contexts.
