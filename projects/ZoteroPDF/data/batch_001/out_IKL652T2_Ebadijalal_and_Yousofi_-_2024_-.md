# ABSTRACT

The current mixed-methods study aimed at incorporating a virtual reality (VR) tool (i.e. Google Expeditions) into the writing process of Iranian English as a foreign language (EFL) learners, examining its impact on their writing motivation and performance. To that end, 42 EFL learners were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups, exploring their favorite places in the world with and without Google Expeditions, respectively. Independent-samples t-tests and paired-samples t-tests were run to investigate the participants’ writing motivation as well as their performance on the pretest and posttest. As the quantitative results demonstrated, the experimental group significantly outscored the control group in both writing motivation and overall writing performance at the end of the experiment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the participants’ attitudes toward Google Expeditions, casting further light on the initial quantitative findings. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data lent support to the contribution of this VR tool toward boosting the participants’ confidence, general knowledge, and autonomy on the one hand and reducing distraction and anxiety on the other. Implications are discussed and future research avenues are outlined.

# 1.  Introduction

Expeditious development of information technology and mobile devices has given rise to the growing popularity of technology-enhanced learning (Chen et  al., 2020; Zou et  al., 2019). Applied to language learning contexts, modern technologies have been reported to boost students’ motivation, engendering among them positive attitudes toward English language learning (Li et  al., 2019). An emerging and highly promising type of technology that can be well incorporated into education is that of virtual reality (VR) (Howard, 2017; Jensen & Konradsen, 2018; Parmaxi, 2020; Yang et  al., 2010). Defined as ‘an immersive computer-enabled technology that replicates an environment and allows a simulation of the user to be present and interact in that environment’ (Lloyd et  al., 2017, p. 222), VR offers learners a sense of presence in a virtual context (Blyth, 2018; Dubovi et  al., 2017). While not necessarily connected causally to learning (Klippel et  al., 2019), this sense of presence has the potential to enhance task performance (Lee et  al., 2010), foster interpretation of information (Li et  al., 2002), positively influence students’ attitudes (Katz & Halpern, 2015), and reinforce their real learning experiences (Cheng & Tsai, 2019).

When applied to educational settings, VR tools bear considerable benefits (Bonner & Reinders, 2018), namely reducing distraction and requiring no specialized technical skills on the part of teachers (Bonner & Reinders, 2018); helping students deeply connect with the material (Gadelha, 2018); fostering motivation, engagement, and active learning (Chen, 2016); opening up opportunities for richer collaborative and experiential learning (Kukulska-Hulme & Viberg, 2018); reinforcing learnability (Wang et  al., 2019; Yeh & Lan, 2018); and being inherently less anxiety-provoking, compared to face-to-face classes (Barrett et  al., 2020). VR devices allow for a full sensory immersion (Barrett et  al., 2020), which is particularly beneficial to foreign language learners who are often deprived of the opportunity to immerse in the target language (Wang et  al., 2020). Immersion in the virtual environments has been acknowledged to bear important educational benefits (Pack et  al., 2020), promoting learning and fostering the transfer of skills from virtual environment to the real world (Kwon, 2019).

As a pedagogical tool, VR has gained increasing popularity over the past two decades (Pack et  al., 2020). The increased availability and affordability of these tools have led to their growing inclusion in various educational milieus (Bonner & Reinders, 2018; Pack et  al., 2020) including foreign language teaching and learning ones (Rau et  al., 2018; Wang et  al., 2019). Further still, the use of VR in second language (L2) acquisition is still in its infancy (Alizadeh, 2019; Pack et  al., 2020), most probably due to the presumption that teachers feel intimidated and are reluctant to incorporate VR tools into their classes (Bonner & Reinders, 2018). In addition, much of the recent VR-related research, inspecting students’ language production, has mainly centered upon L2 speaking and listening (e.g. Awada & Diab, 2018; Chien et  al., 2019; Ebadi & Ebadijalal, 2020; Lan et  al., 2016; Xie et  al., 2019), relatively unmindful of L2 writing (Pack et  al., 2020). Given that L2 writing is an attention-demanding, complex, and time-consuming activity (Han & Hiver, 2018; Xu & Qi, 2017), producing an eloquent piece of writing does not come easily to foreign language learners (Brown, 2004), particularly if they are of low motivation (Wu et  al., 2019). Although VR has largely been regarded as motivational and useful (Tai et  al., 2020), general motivation has mainly been the target. Nonetheless, motivation is domain-sensitive and accordingly, writing motivation may differ from motivation to improve other skills (Lee et  al., 2018). Added to this, empirical evidence in favor of motivational value of VR tools is still limited (Lan et  al., 2016; Tai et  al., 2020), with reports mostly tapping into teachers’ self-reported data (Li et  al., 2019). Also dominant in the literature on VR in L2 learning are qualitative studies, relying merely on students’ self-reported perceptions of the merits of VR for language learning (Bonner & Reinders, 2018; Tai et  al., 2020). That being said, more quantitative studies (Parmaxi, 2020) and classroom-based evidence (Li et al., 2019) are required to explore the potential of technology-enhanced language instruction in foreign language classrooms. To address the above-mentioned lacunae in the literature, the present study, as an initial endeavor, aimed to investigate the impact of Google Expeditions on Iranian English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ writing motivation and performance.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  VR in language education

Three decades following its first debut in the 1960s, researchers began to deploy VR in various educational milieus (Rau et  al., 2018), including language learning ones. As regards English language learning, VR has been reported to furnish students with realistic learning experience, enjoying great potentials for heightening learning achievement (Yang et al., 2010) and furthering learning motivation and engagement (Adolphs et al., 2018; Alizadeh, 2019; Chen et al., 2019; Lan et al., 2019; Makransky & Lilleholt, 2018; Melchor-Couto, 2019). As a potentially valuable tool for language education (Barrett et  al., 2020), VR has been reported to ‘greatly enhance learners’ both communication skills and linguistic competence’ (Wang et  al., 2019, p. 20). The rising popularity of VR tools in educational milieus has encouraged researchers to deploy a variety of such tools in language teaching and learning contexts, namely Google Earth (e.g. Awada & Diab, 2018; Chen et  al., 2019), Google Tour Creator (e.g. Nobrega & Rozenfeld, 2019), Google Street View (Shih, 2015), and Google Expeditions (e.g. Ebadi & Ebadijalal, 2020; Xie et  al., 2019). Google Expeditions, among others, has drawn the attention of researchers and educators alike, transporting individuals to manifold virtual environments, otherwise inaccessible (Alizadeh, 2019). Initially released in 2015, Google Expeditions enables teachers to take learners to myriad virtual destinations all over the world without having to leave the classroom, proffering learners a first-hand experience beyond the limitations of traditional texts, images, and videos (Alizadeh, 2019). In an endeavor to explore the merits of Google Expeditions in an Iranian EFL context, Ebadi and Ebadijalal (2020) lent empirical support to the significant contributions of this VR tool to language learners’ willingness to communicate and oral proficiency. Further, the participants asserted that Google Expeditions enhanced their general knowledge, confidence, enthusiasm, cultural awareness, and motivation.

# 2.2.  Motivation in L2 writing and the role of VR

As the principal predictor of writers’ performance (Hayes, 2012), motivation shapes students’ writing experience (Abdel Latif, 2019), impacts how they approach writing, and how likely they are to proceed with the tasks when they become challenging (Bruning & Horn, 2000). Students with more positive motivational attitudes toward writing perform better on writing tasks (Graham et  al., 2017). Those with lower motivation levels, on the other hand, avoid writing situations, demonstrate anxious composing habits, write fewer words, and procrastinate writing tasks (Abdel Latif, 2019; Mahfoodh, 2017) and are, thus, less likely to succeed in language learning (Dörnyei, 2009; Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2011; Lasagabaster et  al., 2014). Accordingly, the majority of English language learners are struggling writers (Chen et  al., 2019), with writing being the least-developed skill among these learners (Cloud et  al., 2009), one potential reason for which lies in low motivation (Wu et  al., 2019). As the most essential predictor of language learning outcome (Sugita & Takeuchi, 2010), motivation plays an indispensable role in overcoming such undesirable conditions (Guilloteaux & Dörnyei, 2008). Further, as Bruning and Horn (2000) averred, a high level of motivation is requisite for effective writing.

Due to the influential role of motivation in writing, therefore, motivating students to write and helping them overcome negative attitudes toward writing merit research attention (Abdel Latif, 2019). Fostering learners’ motivation will most probably exert influence on the type of writing activities learners decide to perform, increasing their engagement with L2 writing tasks and enhancing their writing development (Zarrinabadi & Rezazadeh, 2020). Accordingly, for L2 researchers and teachers, finding ways to reinforce students’ writing motivation, and writing performance in turn, seems requisite. One such proposal is the integration of VR tools into writing classrooms. Despite all the benefits associated with the use of VR in language learning contexts, such tools have not received adequate research attention in L2 education and their application to language classrooms has remained limited so far (Alizadeh, 2019; Bonner & Reinders, 2018). Less attention has been directed at their affordances when applied to L2 writing in EFL contexts. In a scarce study, Chen et  al. (2019) examined the impact of Google Earth on English language learners’ expository writing. The results evidenced the EFL learners’ engagement in the writing environment and their positive attitudes toward Google Earth. Dolgunsöz et  al. (2018) made use of VR headsets through which students watched three-dimensional VR videos, providing context and information for a writing assignment. Analyzing the participants’ writing scores and comparing them to those who had watched two-dimensional traditional videos for the same purpose, Dolgunsöz et  al. (2018) maintained that although VR did not impact short-term writing performance it did positively influence long-term retention of information provided by the videos.

Founded upon the above argument, the present study aimed at investigating the effect of Google Expeditions VR tool on EFL learners’ writing motivation and performance, and is, thereby, guided by the following research questions:

1. Is there any significant difference between the learners who attended Google Expeditions-enhanced writing classes (henceforth, GE) and those who did not (henceforth, NGE) in terms of writing motivation?   
2. To what extent does Google Expeditions assist the development of the learners’ L2 writing performance?   
3. What are the participants’ attitudes toward the integration of Google Expeditions into their L2 writing classrooms?

# 3.  Method

# 3.1.  Design

The current study employed a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design (Creswell et  al., 2003), the main purpose of which lies in using ‘a qualitative strand to explain initial quantitative results’ (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011, p. 84). More precisely, the participants’ performance on the pretest and posttest along with the writing motivation scale results were analyzed quantitatively. Afterward, the qualitative data, obtained from semi-structured individual interviews, were thematically analyzed to corroborate and refine the quantitative findings.

# 3.2.  Context and participants

English language, as a compulsory subject of study from Grade 7 to Grade 12 in the educational system of Iran, is the most popular foreign language taught at state schools and private language institutes (Moradkhani & Ebadijalal, 2021). Given the large number of students in state schools and the focus of state-run English language instruction on explicit teaching of grammar and reading, rather than communication (Hayati & Mashhadi, 2010), students seek support beyond state schools and enroll at private language institutes, which enjoy more freedom to choose the coursebook and teaching methodology that serve their purposes (Moradkhani & Ebadijalal, 2021). This has given rise to the considerable number of students attending English language institutes in Iran to improve their L2 skills (Moradkhani & Ebadijalal, 2021).

A total sample of 47 EFL learners, zealous to further their writing skills, voluntarily enrolled in this experiment. In accordance with the language institute’s standards, the participants were at the upper-intermediate level. To further homogenize them, they were requested to take part in the DIALANG test and submit the results. As a web-based assessment tool, DIALANG evaluates general language proficiency of individuals, presenting the results in the form of levels ranging from A1 to C2 based on the Common European Framework of Reference for language (CEFR). Five participants, whose proficiency levels were too low or did not submit the test results in due time, were excluded from the study. The resultant 42 upper-intermediate EFL learners, parallel to B2 in CEFR taxonomy, were recruited as the participants of this study. The sample comprised 18 females and 24 males whose ages ranged between 19 and 25 years. None reported prior experience with Google Expeditions or any other VR tool. The participants were all born and raised in Iran and had Persian as their first language. They were all majoring in non-language disciplines. To further assure that the participants were comparable in terms of writing, they were required to write a summary of the last trip they took, which was regarded as the pretest. Thereafter, the participants were randomly assigned to experimental $\left( \mathrm { N } = 2 1 \right)$ ) and control $\left( \ N = 2 1 \right)$ groups.

In respect of ethical concerns, prior to data collection, the participants were provided a general overview of what they were to do throughout the study and their informed consent was obtained. Additionally, the participants were assured that they would remain strictly anonymous; their performance and opinions would be disclosed to no one, including their teachers and language institute authorities; and all elicited data would remain confidential and would be solely used in this study.

# 3.3.  Instruments

To ascertain the participants’ writing motivation, Waller and Papi (2017) writing motivation scale was adopted. This scale comprises seven items (e.g. I really try to learn how to write in English), addressing language learners’ motivation to write in English, adapted from general motivation measures developed by Taguchi et  al. (2009). The items are presented on a six-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always). The present authors piloted the scale with 35 EFL learners studying at the same language institute, with Cronbach reliability estimates demonstrating a high internal consistency in this regard $\stackrel { \prime } { \alpha } = 0 . 8 5 )$ ).

To explore the participants’ writing performance on the pretest, as mentioned above, a summary of the last trip they took was required. As for the posttest, the participants were to travel back in time to The Middle Ages, explaining how they assumed their lives would be if they were to live in that era. On both pretest and posttest, the participants were given 45 minutes to individually compose and submit their writings (250–350 words).

A background questionnaire was designed and distributed among the participants so as to obtain information regarding their English language studying experience, native language, and level of familiarity with Google Expeditions and other VR devices. In addition, the first author conducted semi-structured individual interviews with 19 volunteered GE participants to explore their attitudes toward Google Expeditions (see Appendix A for the list of questions).

# 3.4.  Procedures

Data collection procedure was carried out over nine weeks. To start with, the participants filled out the background questionnaire and writing motivation scale. In the same week, an orientation session was held by the first author (henceforth, the researcher) to familiarize the GE participants with Google Expeditions. They were required to use their smart phones, and the researcher, who was already familiar with Google Expeditions, instructed them on how to connect and manage the application. The instructions were provided in Persian to avoid any misunderstanding on the part of the participants. They were also allowed to ask clarification questions, if any, and to practice using the application to ensure that they would be able to use the tool competently and effortlessly.

Starting from Week 2, the intervention sessions commenced and went on for five consecutive weeks, with two sessions being held each week. The tasks for the participants to perform as well as the time to spend on them were determined after conferring with their EFL teachers at the same language institute so as to ensure what the participants were to do throughout the study would be within the realm of their capabilities. At the beginning of each session the participants were divided into three groups of seven. There were two main rationales behind this classification. First, a limited number of users (or devices) could seemingly connect to Google Expeditions at a given time. Second, since it was their first experience with Google Expeditions, the participants were offered some time to help each other and resolve concerns on how to use the application, if need be. Thereafter, the researcher provided them with a list of favorite places they would like to visit in the flesh. Each group was supposed to pick one place for a session.

The GE participants were required to take a virtual trip to the destination they had chosen with the assistance of Google Expeditions in 30 minutes. Subsequently, they were given 15 minutes to share their perceptions of the virtual trip they had taken. Afterward, each participant was provided 45 minutes to write a summary of the trip also elucidating if they liked to visit that place in real life. They were allowed to take notes during the trips and to reflect upon them in the 15-minute group discussion. In the writing phase, however, they had no text to resort to. Each session lasted from 90 to 100 minutes. Care was taken so that no same group members would work together for more than one session. The exact same procedure was followed for the NGE group. The only difference between the two groups lay in the integration of Google Expeditions into GE group’s writing sessions and its exclusion from the NGE group’s ones. More specifically, each of the three NGE groups received a tablet PC on which they were afforded some pictures of the given destination they had chosen to visit, accompanied by textual information. The information was retrieved from the Google Expeditions application so that both groups could have access to the same information, one through Google Expeditions (in the case of GE participants) and one through pictures (in the case of NGE participants). Furthermore, the NGE participants were provided with the same amount of time, as GE ones, to explore information, discuss, and write their texts.

In Week 7 the participants took the posttest, following which, they filled in the writing motivation scale anew. All in all, the participants spent 36 minutes on average to write their texts. Writings submitted by the GE participants ranged from 247 to 332 words and those submitted by NGE ones were between 269 and 356 words. During Weeks 8 and 9 semi-structured interview sessions were held so that the participants could share their perceptions of the experiment. To secure mutual understandability, the interviews were conducted in Persian. Each interview session was audio-recorded and lasted between 12 and 20 minutes.

# 3.5.  Data analysis

The analyzed data in this study comprised the background questionnaire, participants’ performance on the pretest and posttest, two independent administrations of the writing motivation scale, and semi-structured individual interviews.

# 3.5.1.  Quantitative data analysis

IELTS writing rating scale was utilized to assess the participants’ writing performance (see Appendix B). Regardless of the language under investigation, this rubric evaluates writing performance in terms of task achievement, coherence and cohesion, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy. It affords learners band descriptors ranging from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating better writing performance. Both authors of the present study had the experience of using the IELTS writing rating scale to evaluate EFL learners’ writing performance. Nonetheless, to enhance the objectivity of the scoring process, the rubric was discussed in full detail and joint understanding was guaranteed. The written texts were separately graded by both authors. Importantly, to avoid biased scoring, all texts were graded anonymously. Inter-rater reliability was conducted to corroborate the consistency of scoring, with results demonstrating fairly high consistency in this regard $\mathbf { \Psi } ( \mathbf { r _ { \alpha } } = \mathbf { \Psi } . 9 1 \mathbf { \Psi } )$ ). Further, areas of discrepancy were discussed and resolved. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19. Independent- and paired-samples t-tests were run to address the first two research questions, inspecting the writing motivation and performance of GE and NGE groups prior to the intervention (Time 1, T1) and subsequent to it (Time 2, T2). The assumptions of these parametric tests were also checked in advance to ensure that the obtained data could be analyzed using them. Further, to avoid the possibility of Type-I error, owing to multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of 0.01 was utilized.

# 3.5.2.  Qualitative data analysis

The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim into Word document. To secure the credibility of the transcriptions, member checking (Dörnyei, 2007) was conducted. In doing so, the transcribed interviews were sent to the participants, allowing them to check the data for accuracy and to make any modifications, if needed. To address the third research question, upon receiving the participants’ feedback, the transcripts were thematically analyzed through a three-stage process (see Figure 1). At the first stage, the authors read through the transcriptions multiple times and identified core themes reflecting the participants’ attitudes toward Google Expeditions (i.e. theme assignment stage).

![](img/18a21726275e3650d6aa6975b0abf8210537ba03a2e1712757d5873bcc9e198e.jpg)  
Figure 1. S chematic representation of qualitative data analysis.

Thereafter, the identified themes were combined, revised, or removed and themes with similar content were merged into a single category (i.e. categorization stage). Lastly, each category was assigned a label in accordance with its underlying content (i.e. labeling stage). To ensure objectivity, both authors coded data in isolation, with inter-rater reliability estimates indicating an acceptable consistency $\mathbf { \Phi } ( \mathbf { r } = \mathbf { \Phi } . 9 0 )$ . Further, areas of ambiguity were discussed till consensus was secured.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  Quantitative results

To address the first research question, inquiring the participants’ writing motivation levels at T1 and T2, paired-samples t-tests were run. Mean differences between the participants’ writing motivation at T1 and T2 are presented in Table 1. As the results indicated, there was a statistically significant difference in GE participants’ writing motivation between T1 and T2 $\operatorname { \ t } = - 6 . 6 8 3$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ , $d ^ { 1 } = 1 . 4 5 9 _ { , }$ ). In other words, as a result of deploying Google Expeditions, the GE participants’ writing motivation significantly enhanced. With regard to the NGE group, however, no such statistically significant difference was observed $\mathrm { ( t = - 1 } . 2 2 9$ , $p = . 2 3 3$ , $d = . 2 6 8$ ).

To answer the second research question, addressing possible differences between GE and NGE groups in terms of writing performance, a number of independent-samples t-tests were conducted. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for pretest and posttest in the two groups. Levene’s tests for equality of variances did not reach the level of significance, so equal variances were assumed. The results of the independent-samples t-tests revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups’ scores on pretest in terms of task achievement $\mathrm { \Delta t } = - . 7 3 5$ , $p = . 4 6 6$ , $d = . 2 2 7 ,$ ), coherence and cohesion $\mathbf { \left( t = - . 9 5 7 \right. }$ , $ { p }  { = }  { \ } . 3 4 4$ , $d = . 2 9 6 )$ , lexical resource $\mathrm { \mathit { t } } = 1 . 1 0 1$ , $p = . 2 7 7$ , $d \ : = \ : . 3 3 9 .$ ), grammatical range and accuracy $\mathrm { ( t = - } . 8 8 4$ , $ { p } = \ . 3 8 2$ , $d \digamma =$ .273), and overall writing performance $( \mathrm { t } = - . 6 8 5$ , $p \ = \ . 4 9 7$ , $d = . 2 1 1 \dot { 1 }$ ). At T2, on the contrary, the results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the two groups in overall writing performance $( \mathrm { t } = - 6 . 2 4 1$ , $ { p } =  { . } 0 0 0$ , $d = 1 . 9 3 3$ ). More specifically, the results of independent-samples t-tests revealed that there were significant differences between the two groups in task achievement $\operatorname { \ t } = - 3 . 3 2 9$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $d = 1 . 0 2 7 ;$ ), lexical resource $\mathrm { ( t = - } 7 . 8 4 6$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 0$ , $d = 2 . 4 2 4 )$ ), and grammatical range and accuracy $\mathrm { ( t } = - 3 . 5 7 0$ , $p = . 0 0 1$ , $d = 1 . 1 0 3$ ). In terms of coherence and cohesion, however, no such trend was supported by the statistical results $\mathrm { ( t = - 1 . 4 0 4 }$ , $p = . 1 6 8$ , $d = . 4 3 5 )$ ). Put differently, Google Expeditions had the potential to significantly improve the participants’ L2 writing at least in three dimensions of task achievement, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy.

Note: Task Ach. $=$ task achievement, Coh./Coh. $=$ coherence and cohesion, Lex. Res. $=$ lexical resource, Gr./Ac. $=$ grammatical range and accuracy.

To further investigate if each group made significant advancement in writing performance at T2, compared with T1, paired-samples t-tests were carried out. In so doing, the scores of GE and NGE participants at T1 and T2 were compared. With regard to the GE group, the results revealed a significant advantage in task achievement $\mathrm { ( t = } - 3 . 6 2 7$ , $p = . 0 0 2$ , $d = . 7 9 2 )$ as well as in lexical resource $\mathrm { ( t = - } 8 . 8 0 0$ , $p = . 0 0 0$ , $d = 1 . 9 2 3$ ), grammatical range and accuracy $\mathrm { ( t } = - 3 . 9 9 0$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 1$ , $d \ = \ . 9 4 6 )$ ), and overall L2 writing $\mathrm { ( t = - 7 . 9 9 4 }$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0 0$ , $d { = } 1 . 7 7 4 \rangle$ , while no significant difference was observed in coherence and cohesion $\mathrm { ( t = - 1 } . 0 9 6$ , $p = . 2 8 6$ , $d = . 2 3 9 )$ ). It is safe, therefore, to conclude that the inclusion of Google Expeditions tool in the writing process, made a significant contribution to the participants’ writing performance. Nevertheless, taking the NGE group into consideration, no statistically significant progress was found in overall writing performance $\mathrm { ( t = - 1 } . 5 2 4$ , $p \ = \ . 1 4 3$ , $d = . 3 3 2 ,$ ), nor in task achievement $\mathrm { \Phi } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { t } = - . 8 9 0$ , $p = . 3 8 4$ , $d = . 1 9 4 ,$ ), coherence and cohesion $\mathrm { ( t = - } 6 7 9$ , $ { p } \ : = \ : . 5 0 5$ , $d = . 1 4 8 ^ { \cdot }$ ), lexical resource $\mathrm { ( t = - } 6 1 6$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } } . 5 4 5$ , $d =$ .136), and grammatical range and accuracy $( { \mathrm { t } } = - . 9 0 0$ , $ { p } = \ . 3 7 9$ , $d \digamma =$ .196) at T2.

# 4.2.  Qualitative results

The three-stage thematic analysis of the qualitative data, addressing the third research question, yielded three major themes.

# 4.2.1.  Google Expeditions and L2 writing

The interviewees maintained that Google Expeditions assisted them in generating ideas and enhanced their confidence in L2 writing. As Student [1] mentioned:

Generally speaking, it is challenging to write in English. On the one side, you have to come up with generative ideas that are relevant to the task. On the other, you have to write them in English, which is not your native language. But this application [Google Expeditions] provided me with lots of innovative ideas. All I had to do was putting them into written words, which made writing less challenging to me.

Student [2] stated:

I don’t usually feel confident enough to compose a good text in English, because I always think that I might end up turning in a blank piece of paper to my teacher. When we took those virtual trips in groups, however, I felt much more confident, having access to all those interesting information to refer to in my writing.

As corroborated by Student [3]:

During the writing time, I was wondering how I could put ALL [emphasis added] those brilliant ideas into words, which I was determined to do.

Also inferred from these excerpts, the GE students made endeavor to address all pieces of information provided by Google Expeditions. This might help explain why they made no significant headway in coherence and cohesion of their texts. Striving to put lots of information within a single piece of writing, possibly without establishing logical connections among them, may diminish the coherence and cohesion of the text.

Student [4] attested that:

I paid close attention to all the bits and pieces of information available on the application, especially to vocabularies. That is why I learned so many new words during the experiment. Ones that I could not have acquired otherwise.

As substantiated by Student [5]:

Given that I was to compose a text, when I was placed in those virtual environments, I was curious to grasp how, as a reliable and authentic tool [based on the interviewee’s perception], Google Expeditions managed the content. I mean what grammatical structures were used to convey the message. Because I think grammar plays the most important role in one’s writing and I wanted to make use of the same structures as were used by the tool.

Student [6] also expressed:

The most enjoyable part of those virtual trips was the absence of those who tend to evaluate you. The teacher was not there and we were all busy exploring that new world together, leaving no room for subjective judgments.

The above excerpts, in conjunction with further similar remarks made by the interviewees, may help to clarify the GE participants’ significantly higher scores in lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy at T2. Finding themselves free from the subjective judgment of others, the GE students felt free to pay closer attention to the words and structures of the texts provided by Google Expeditions.

# 4.2.2.  Google Expeditions and L2 writing motivation

As corroborated by the statistical results, employing Google Expeditions in the writing process significantly promoted the participants’ L2 writing motivation. As Student [7] uttered:

I could not wait for the next session to start. I downloaded the application to practice with and I came to know that using it in the class with peers was far more motivating.

Student [8] argued:

I believe it [Google Expeditions] increased our motivation beyond my expectations. Some of us decided to utilize the application outside the classroom to improve our other skills-, speaking most probably.

Student [9] substantiated:

Google Expeditions did increase my motivation. I was willing to write in L2 not only in the class but also out of the class.

A noted in the above excerpts, Google Expeditions enhanced the GE participants’ motivation in general and their writing motivation in particular.

# 4.2.3.  Further merits and drawbacks of Google Expeditions

The affordances of Google Expeditions, as perceived by the learners, were not limited to fostering L2 writing motivation and performance. As Student [10] explained:

When I am to write in English during class time, [although it doesn’t actually occur] I constantly feel that the teacher is staring at me, wondering why I am not writing anything. So I start to panic, I feel anxious, my palms sweat and, therefore, I receive low scores when it comes to writing. Being in those virtual environments together with my friends and classmates, made me feel free since no one was there to pass judgment on me. That is the part I liked best in this experiment.

Substantiated by further interviewees, it seems that the GE participants found Google Expeditions environments, compared to face-to-face ones, less anxiety-provoking as they were free from teacher’s and peer’ judgment. Further benefits of Google Expeditions, brought up by the interviewees were easy access to information and enhancement of general knowledge. Student [11] averred:

It [Google Expeditions] offered us a bunch of easily accessible details to enhance our writings. I think using this application makes people more knowledgeable.

Student [12] also noted that:

Speaking from experience, Google Expeditions gave us easy access to information we never knew.

The students also embraced the occlusion of the real world distractors stemming from the immersive virtual environment of Google Expeditions. Student [13] maintained:

I was so engrossed in the virtual environment of the tool that I lost track of time.

Student [14] also uttered:

It felt like a real trip. I mean, we could travel to interesting places without having to pay for it.

As the GE participants bore witness to, a further benefit of Google Expeditions was the feeling of autonomy that the tool offered, fostering their independent performance. As Student [15] enunciated:

The app allowed us to work autonomously, boosting our confidence, and letting us enjoy the sense of independent learning.

Last but not least, the majority of participants requested Google Expeditions to be part of their writing classes as they came to the conclusion that this VR tool promoted their L2 writing. Student [16] suggested:

Please ask our teachers to take us to virtual trips if they want us to write better.

As an educational tool, Google Expeditions comes with its own limitations, to some of which the GE participants referred. As Student [17] contended:

Each session some of us had connection issues and we couldn’t figure out why.

Besides connection problem, rather than reducing real world distractions, some GE members found the tool distractive. Student [18] asserted that:

I did not feel relaxed in those virtual environments. Although it was a worthy experience, I found Google Expeditions unnatural and distractive.

Student [19] added:

Sometimes it made me forget what I already knew rather than helping me generate ideas. During some sessions I drew a blank and it took me some minutes to realize what I should write.

# 5.  Discussion

The quantitative results demonstrated that, in contrast to that of the NGE ones, the writing motivation of the GE participants significantly increased at the end of the experiment. The GE interviewees acknowledged that Google Expeditions boosted their motivation, conforming to the literature on the position that VR tools foster learners’ motivation and engagement (Adolphs et  al., 2018; Chen et  al., 2019; Enkin, 2022; Lan et  al., 2019; Makransky & Lilleholt, 2018; Melchor-Couto, 2019). Ebadi and Ebadijalal (2020) also substantiated that Google Expeditions has the potential to foster EFL learners’ motivation. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the participants of the current study had no prior experience with Google Expeditions. Consequently, in all probability, the novelty of the tool had heightened its motivational effect, a finding bore out by Barrett et  al. (2020).

The quantitative findings evinced that the GE participants not only made significant advancement on the posttest, compared to the pretest, in terms of task achievement, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and overall writing performance but also significantly outperformed the NGE ones. In a similar vein, Tai et  al. (2020) and Shih (2020) appreciated the VR technology environments boosting vocabulary acquisition and retention on the part of the EFL learners. Taken together, such findings stand in contrast to that of Dolgunsöz et  al. (2018) who reported VR not exercising influence upon their EFL students’ writing performance. Nevertheless, it accords closely with Chen et  al. (2019)

study, acknowledging the contribution of VR environment to EFL learners’ expository writing. Taking the coherence and cohesion into consideration, the GE participants did not show significant improvement on the posttest, as compared with the pretest, most probably because, as the interviewees averred, they regarded the information Google Expeditions offered them as valuable and sought to use them all in their writings probably without establishing the requisite logical connections.

Paralleling the conception put forth by Han and Hiver (2018) that psychological factors, including motivation, determine the level of effort that learners are willing to invest in the writing process, the GE participants affirmed that they were willing to continue L2 writing. Such willing learners tend to be more interested in the language they study and more likely to pursue their goals (Dakowska, 2007; Kurk, 2019). As the GE interviewees stated, they also felt less anxious in the Google Expeditions environment, compared to those of their regular face-to-face classes, as they found themselves free from teacher or peer’s judgmental opinions. This finding resonates with that of other studies in the literature (e.g. Barrett et  al., 2020).

The convenient access to rich information and the increased general knowledge were among the further benefits of Google Expeditions noted by the GE participants, mirroring the findings of Barrett et  al. (2020) and Ebadi and Ebadijalal (2020), respectively. The occlusion of real world distractions (Bonner & Reinders, 2018), stemming from the immersive virtual environments was another affordance that Google Expeditions offered to the GE participants. Along the same lines, Gadelha (2018) contended that ‘by blocking out visual and auditory distractions in the classroom, VR has the potential to help students deeply connect with the material’ (p. 40), reinforcing their task performance (Lee et  al., 2010). Positive relationship between perceived sense of presence and motivational beliefs in virtual environments has also been established in the literature (Lee et  al., 2010; Makransky & Lilleholt, 2018). The GE participants recognized that Google Expeditions was a boost to their confidence, a finding supported by Parmaxi (2020), as well as to their independent performance. Part of the reason might be that, as Peterson (2011) asserted, the nature of virtual environments provides opportunities for learner-centered performance. Notwithstanding such benefits attributed to Google Expeditions, the GE participants complained about the connection problem when using the application. Further, although most interviewees reported that Google Expeditions occluded distractions of the physical environment, some found the tool distractive in itself, corroborating Kessler’s (2018) presumption that VR platforms may be a diversion to some students.

# 6.  Conclusion

Given the scarcity of empirical evidence on the utility of VR tools (Lan et  al., 2016; Tai et  al., 2020), the present study set out to amplify the empirical work in the field by exploring the influence of Google Expeditions on 42 Iranian EFL learners’ writing motivation and performance. Built upon the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data, major conclusions drawn from this mixed-methods study are as follows. First, Google Expeditions was found to significantly enhance the participants’ L2 writing motivation. Second, this study affords evidence that Google Expeditions fostered participants’ overall L2 writing, especially in terms of task achievement, lexical resource, and grammatical range and accuracy. Additionally, as attested by the participants, Google Expeditions also boosted their confidence, general knowledge, and autonomy on the one hand and mitigated distraction and anxiety on the other. The participants also relished Google Expeditions providing them a safe environment to explore language learning and redeeming them from the subjective judgment of others.

This study has some implication for the field as well. Aligning with Parmaxi (2020), a contribution of the present study to the field is that VR has a growing potential when applied to language classrooms. As a potentially valuable addition to language learning (Barrett et  al., 2020), VR seems to invigorate language classrooms with the help of increasingly ubiquitous phone devices. In the light of the benefits that the GE participants of this study enjoyed, L2 teachers and practitioners are invited to consider the integration of VR into language teaching and learning milieus so as to assist learners in improving their skills, and generating and maintaining motivation. Be that as it may, they are recommended to avoid over-emphasizing the potentials of VR tools and gain a good knowledge of the limitations and drawbacks of such tools prior to putting them into use. After all, as Felix (1998) enlightened us, ‘intelligent use of technology requires awareness of the balancing disadvantages’ (p. 55). Further, VR tools can be efficiently integrated into language teaching and learning contexts to support struggling EFL writers who lack motivation, proffering them opportunities to practice and advance their L2 skills in a relaxed environment. Additionally, examiners are recommended to consider the development of innovative and real-life tasks in virtual environments. Policy makers may also want to explore the possibilities of integrating practical and low-cost VR tools into education in order to boost teachers and learners’ classroom performance and positive feelings.

This study has some limitations that should be borne in mind. First, the present study employed a short-term program. Potential researchers should extend the duration of their studies to assess long-term effects of VR intervention. In addition, the current authors attempted to investigate the influence of Google Expeditions on L2 writing and motivation. Thereby, care must be taken in generalizing the results to additional VR platforms and L2 skills. To gain a fuller picture of the effectiveness of VR tools in EFL milieus, further studies, examining a variety of VR tools, are to be conducted. A further pertinent issue is the novelty factor. In all likelihood, the novelty of deploying Google Expeditions heightened the participants’ motivation and interest. Future researchers are recommended to investigate the impact of VR on learners who have prior experience with such tools. Additionally, given that writing is an under-explored skill in VR-related research (Parmaxi, 2020), further research on VR-enhanced L2 writing is recommended. This study was limited by the sample size and proficiency level of the participants as well, examining a larger number of students from among a variety of differential proficiency levels may yield novel results. Accordingly, although care must be exercised in generalizing the findings of the current study, the overall insights gleaned from this experiment may extend beyond EFL learners to include learners of other languages.

The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the present research.
