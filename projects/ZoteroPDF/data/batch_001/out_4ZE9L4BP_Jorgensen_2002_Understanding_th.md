# Understanding the Conditions for Public Discourse: four rules for selecting letters to the editor

KARIN WAHL JORGENSEN Cardiff University, UK

ABSTRACT Using the work of deliberative democratic theorists, this paper investigates and critiques the criteria letters editors at newspapers use to construct their column. Deliberative democratic theory values egalitarian public discussion on matters of common concern, and worries about providing the conditions for this discussion. The paper identi es four rules for selection; referred to as the rules of relevance, brevity, entertainment and authority. First, the rule of relevance refers to the demand for the content of the letter to be “relevant”, or respond to issues and events already on the agenda. The rule of brevity, in turn, encapsulates the requirement to write short, punchy letters that state the reader’s view in less than 300 words. Thirdly, the rule of entertainment highlights how editors prefer spectacular, punchy letters. Finally, the rule of authority captures the rejection of ungrammatical writing, and letters written in unconventional styles.

The paper demonstrates that the rules of selection are not entirely in line with the visions of deliberative democrats, because they privilege particular forms of expression. Nevertheless, these rules make it practically possible to open up a site for public discussion in the newspaper.

# Introduction

The letters-to-the-editor section is one of a few arenas for public discussion by regular citizens, and can be seen as a key institution of the public sphere (Habermas, 1989). This is, at any rate, the belief of many editors, who proclaim the section to be “among the few outlets available to the public for voicing opinion”, “the community’s heartbeat”, and “a debating society that never adjourns” (e.g. Kapoor and Botan, 1992, p. 5; Kapoor, 1995). Likewise, readership surveys show the letters section is one of the most popular items of the newspaper, read by about half of the newspaper audience (Hynds, 1994).

In the current historical moment there is a yearning for the kind of public debate made possible by institutions such as the letters section, and a sense that its scarcity spells disaster for democracy. Beginning in the late 1980s, journalists, scholars, politicians and pundits have become concerned about alienation and cynicism among citizens (e.g. Blumler and

Gurevitch, 1995; Fallows, 1996; Capella and Jamieson, 1997). They nd evidence for a “crisis of public communications” (Blumler and Gurevitch, 1995) in plunging rates of citizen participation in politics. In response, the “public journalism” movement seeks to reform newspapers’ relationships with their readership by engaging local communities in newspaper coverage (cf. Rosen and Merritt, 1994; Charity, 1995; Merritt, 1995; Rosen, 1996; Glasser, 1999).

While discourses on this perceived democratic crisis offer a range of explanations for the decline of public participation in politics, most voices in the debate agree that citizens must be empowered to speak up in public. The reason for the public’s silence, scholars suggest, is the lack of opportunities and places for speaking (cf. Eliasoph, 1998; Ettema and Glasser, 1998). And, as Cottle (2000) points out, whose “voices and viewpoints structure and inform news discourse goes to the heart of democratic views of, and radical concerns about, the news media” (p. 427). Against this backdrop, I suggest that it is crucial to assess the potential of already existing forums, and this is what this paper sets out to do, by looking at the case of letters to the editor.

Over the last 50 years, many scholars have investigated the letters section (e.g. Buell, 1975; Volgy et al., 1977; Sigelman and Walkosz, 1992; Hynds, 1994). Most studies of letters are conducted from a social scientic, quantitative approach, and set out to test “empirically the degree to which letters writers are similar to the electorate”, or whether, in demographic terms, they differ from the “public” (Buell, 1975; Volgy et al., 1977, p. 32). Many study the degree to which the letters page can be considered a “public opinion thermometer” (Sigelman and Walkosz, 1992), and the consensus among journalism scholars has been that letters are, at best, “hazy reections of public opinion” (Grey and Brown, 1970, p. 450), because letter writers are not representative of the general population.

This body of scholarship rarely asks the question of whether a “public forum” such as the letters section provides us with an opportunity for the kind of debate democracies need. This paper interrogates just that problem by identifying and critiquing the rules that editors use when selecting letters. Although small papers accept up to 80 per cent of the letters they receive, large papers are forced to scrap a much larger percentage.1 The New York Times, for example, publishes less than six per cent of the letters received (cf. Reader, 2001). Despite the great variation among newspapers in terms of how many letters they receive and publish, this paper sets out to show that editors at US newspapers, regardless of their size and type, share certain fundamental standards of selection: editors agree on what makes good and bad letters, and by following those conventions they standardise the public debate of letters to the editor.

On the basis of analysis of two studies of letters editors’ work, the paper derives four different “rules” or criteria for letters to the editor, referred to as the rules of relevance, entertainment , brevity, and authority. These are the criteria that emerge repeatedly in editors’ discussions of letters. By identifying “rules” for selection of letters, this paper does not propose that letters are chosen according to rigid, unalterable institutional instructions. Instead, the paper is concerned with how “repeated practices and forms that media workers use to do their job” (Shoemaker and Reese, 1996, p. 105; see also Sumpter, 2000, p. 334) favour certain forms of expression. The criteria identied here are also rules in the sense that they rule the public discourse: they determine what kind of debate occurs on the letters pages. By constructing the public of letters to the editor through their “cultural mediation” (Cottle, 2000, p. 443), they determine whose voices and concerns are systematically privileged, and whose never stand a chance of being heard.

To assess the construction of the public through the selection of letters, the paper asks whether the kind of discussion that takes place on these pages squares with an ideal of democratic discussion, as embodied in theories of deliberative democracy, or, as Cohen (1997) denes it, the belief that “democratic politics involves public deliberation focused on the common good, requires some form of manifest equality among citizens, and shapes the identity and interests of citizens in ways that contribute to the formation of a public conception of common good” (p. 69; cf. also Christiano, 1997, p. 243). Ju¨ rgen Habermas, in his work on discourse ethics (e.g. 1993; 1995; 1996), reconstructs the ideal of deliberative democracy with an eye towards more fully characterising the relationship between deliberation and the justication of normative claims. I draw on this work to specify how the concept of deliberation allows us to think of equality and access in public debate.

The paper demonstrates that while the rules of selection are not entirely in line with visions of deliberative democrats, because they privilege particular forms of expression, they nevertheless are the necessary bases for opening up a site for public discussion.

# Method

To arrive at the rules governing letters selection, the paper analyses two sets of data related to the cultural practices of the newsroom in general and the letters section in particular. First, the paper looks at letters editors’ discussion of their work in more than 60 articles in the trade journal of the US National Conference of Editorial Writers, The Masthead. The Masthead has published a range of articles on letters, and offers a rich explication of how editors would like their letters section to appear, and how their visions have changed over time. Articles in The Masthead about letters to the editor since 1967—which was when the journal began to carry its rst detailed discussion of letters and op-ed pages—are read in an attempt to understand the reasons for and consequences of the practices that shape the letters section. The methodological approach employed here seeks to investigate how the institutional practices and constraints of journalism congure access to and diversity and deliberation in the letters section (cf. Garnham, 1994, pp. 360–62).

The paper further draws on evidence gathered in a series of 23 in-depth, ethnographic interviews with letters editors at San Francisco Bay Area daily and weekly newspapers. The interviews, conducted between 15 June and 15 July 1999, lasted between one-and-a-half and four hours.2 These interviews were conducted as part of the author’s doctoral dissertation work. Though convenience was the primary reason for conducting the study in this area, the San Francisco Bay is also uniquely suited for a study of citizen participation in complex contemporary societies: it is a multicultural, heterogeneous area grappling with the value clashes that come with difference and structural inequality, on issues such as racism, growth, abortion, gun control, welfare, and crime.

The Masthead articles offer a detailed overview of the criteria editors use in selecting letters, while the in-depth interviews provide an opportunity for elaboration of editors’ justications. The analysis directs us to the ways in which “ideology is a function of the discourse and of the logic of social processes, rather than an intention of the agent” (Hall, 1982, p. 88). It points to the profoundly systematic, socially grounded origins of the rules of selection. It thus transcends the examination of individual motivation, making the assumption that the actions of individuals are indicative of the social context in which they operate; in this case, the culture of the newsroom. Articles in

The Masthead, then, are analysed as discourses that are the hiding places of common-sense theories about public discourse and democracy. These discourses are produced by editors to justify the way they work, and how they select letters. They encapsulate the fantasies and frustrations of democratic conversation as understood by newsworkers (cf. Hardt and Brennen, 1995), and offer a way for us to better grasp our own feelings, as a collectivity, about the difcult democratic process.

# Deliberative Democratic Theory

To assess the practices that make up the letters section, the paper draws on theories of deliberative democracy, with particular attention to Habermas’s work in this tradition. Deliberative democratic theories are especially appropriate to the study of letters to the editor as a site for public debate. First, they coincide with the normative beliefs of letters editors about their section’s role in democracy as a site for the articulation of public opinion (cf. Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001a; 2001b), encapsulating the belief that “without conversation … democratic journalism will have no body” (Kunelius, 2001, p. 50). As such, they can be used as a vantage point for critique, and for theorising alternatives to existing norms and practices. Secondly, they offer a compelling justication for the value of conversation to democracy, by insisting that it is only by rational deliberation in the company of others with whom we share the world that we can make just decisions. Such an understanding puts a heavy duty on the shoulders of the commercial press: it sees the press not merely as a “fourth estate” that keeps government accountable through constant scrutiny, but also as the place where citizens can have their say.

Deliberative democratic theory grounds the self-governance of democracy in a process of reasoned deliberation among citizens who are presumptively and procedurally equal. To deliberative democrats, “the will of the people” is arrived at in common, rather than being the sum aggregate of individual opinions (cf. Taylor, 1990, p. 109). Discussion in public “around alternative conceptions of the public good”

(Cohen, 1997, p. 68) is the only way to arrive at legitimate laws (cf. Elster, 1997). To borrow Barber’s nice turn of phrase, in deliberative theories “the right of every individual to speak to others, to assert his being through the act of communication, is identied with the precious wellspring of human autonomy and dignity” (1984, p. 311). As Habermas (1995) suggests in his work on discourse ethics,

Thus, Habermas (1995) proposes that to gain a valid understanding of other people’s situations, and formulate decisions that affect their lives, you must actually consult them as equals, respecting their points of views and listening to their stories (p. 67). Moreover, this intersubjective discursive cooperation must take the form of what Habermas calls “communicative action”, that is, communication oriented toward reaching understanding.

news organisation itself. They should also allow for members of the public to introduce topics, and open them up to the critical scrutiny of public debate.

Habermas, along with other theorists of deliberative democracy, argues that the intersubjective discussion should never be divorced from “the concrete point of departure of a disturbed normative agreement” (1995, p. 103). These disruptions of the normative consensus set the agenda for the discussion (cf. Habermas, 1995, p. 103). Practical discourses hence depend on concrete, substantive content external to the abstract understanding of norms—they depend on material fed into it from the outside. As Schudson (1997) points out, democratic “talk centers on public matters. This also means, I believe, that what democratic conversations are about comes from public sources. The newspaper is the historically central source of democratic conversation” (p. 305). Beyond offering information, newspapers must also solicit new ideas from citizens. Therefore, letters to the editor selected for publication should not merely address normative concerns as reected in ongoing stories placed on the agenda by the

For the process of introducing and guiding topics of discussion to be truly democratic, deliberative democrats insist on the centrality of procedural justice and equality. Procedures are just when the connections between deliberation and outcomes are evident—that is, when the conditions of association are discursively determined, radically open, and transparent (e.g. Cohen, 1997, pp. 73–74). In diverse modern societies, where the sheer act of communicating across boundaries of difference and disagreement can be an almost insurmountable challenge, we need basic ground rules that spell out the nature of the deliberative interaction (cf. Benhabib, 1996). As Schudson (1997) has suggested, the “fully public democratic conversation takes place … in settings where talk is bound to be uncomfortable” (p. 306). Public deliberation is by its very nature an uneasy kind of social interaction, and to minimise the squirming, blushing, or bursting out in rage in the company of Others, we need some formal measures shared by everyone—measures that are rooted in the conception of democracy as the process of public deliberation among free and equal citizens. When we consider the criteria for letters to the editor, as articulated by the “gatekeepers of the public sphere”—the newsworkers who construct the public of the letters section—it is useful to think of the criteria in those terms: we must keep in mind the necessity for “ground rules” of a procedural nature that can ensure equality in the public discourse. At the same time, we should also critically examine these same criteria to understand the ways in which they, as institutional practices, help and hinder democratic public deliberation.

If editors see public deliberation as the sine qua non of democracy, and the letters section as one prime site for its articulation, it is useful to ask to what extent their discussion of letters squares with democratic ideals. Needless to say, it would be quite unfair to subject the editors—as professionals and as the front line in the difcult struggle to make democracy work—to the exacting standards of political philosophers: given that deliberative democrats pose an ideal vision, and its realisation can be found only in utopia, the editors’ visions and practices could never measure up to the yardstick of deliberative democracy. Nevertheless, it is useful to have high standards in sight; without them, we could hardly change the ways in which we conduct our lives, our democracies, and our press.

# Criteria for Selection of Letters to the Editor: the rules of relevance, brevity, entertainment, and authority

The Rule of Relevance

Editors of the letters section spoke eloquently of their democratic visions on the pages of their trade journal, The Masthead, and in the in-depth interviews.3 Alongside their belief in the centrality of public discourse, their work is also inuenced by the everyday constraints of journalism. In particular, their decisions about which letters to pick for publications are informed by dominant news values, or understandings of what constitutes bona de news. Scholars have come up with fairly extensive typologies characterising news values (e.g. Galtung and Ruge, 1965; Gans, 1980; Fuller, 1996, Harcup and O’Neill, 2001). Though these reconstructions differ in their exact composition, most agree that news should be relevant, useful and of interest to the readers (see for example Brooks et al., 1992, pp. 6–10). For an event to be newsworthy, it should “touch the health, safety, environment or education of signicant segments of the public … The more of your readers who may be affected and the more direct the effect, the more relevant—and therefore the more important—the story will be” (Brooks et al., 1992, p. 6). Stories that are useful, in turn, are those that enable citizens to think and act in ways they want and need—whether by providing them with information about the events of the world, or by helping them ll out tax forms (Brooks et al., 1992, p. 7). Finally, the news value of interest emphasises events that touch the lives and emotions of readers; such as features on groups and individuals in the community, photos from sporting events, and stories about the lives of celebrities, politicians and other public gures (Brooks et al., 1992, p. 9). These key news values, shaped in part by concern for the public interest and in part by the need for newspapers to succeed in the market, also play a central role in helping letters editors to decide which contributions from readers have a legitimate place in the newspaper column.

First and foremost, the debate of letters sections is constructed by an allegiance to the rule of relevance: it takes the form of a response to items already placed rmly on the agenda by the paper—news items that are “relevant”, “timely”, (cf. Pierce, 1988, p. 8) of “general interest” (cf. Cox, 1976), or about “important and topical” issues (cf. Fretz, 1988). One editor on a local weekly, in discussing letters that she felt were “mediocre”, pointed to the frequent letters she receives from gun enthusiasts:

Topics must have earned a legitimate place in the public debate by virtue of newsworthy events or actions by institutions or other sources of authority, which means that regular citizens’ attempts at introducing their own topics to the agenda will almost invariably fail. Studies indicate that most letters reect the issues of the front page and editorials, and some editors even institute a practice of only using letters that refer to op-ed page content (cf. Pritchard and Berkowitz, 1979; Romanow et al., 1981). And though this satises one of the conditions of debate outlined by thinkers of deliberative democracy, that of providing content for debate, it does not allow for citizens to introduce their own ideas; the agenda setting that Schudson (1997) sees as crucial to democratic participation. Readers can merely be the “watchdogs” over a newspaper’s point of view.

The rule of relevance also manifests itself in the requirement for letters to arrive from within the newspaper’s circulation area. As one editor put it,

As a community newspaper, serving this community, I don’t publish letters that are sent from other parts of the country, because it has nothing to do with this community … the topic of the letter is irrelevant. It’s the fact that I don’t have space to publish people’s viewpoints from some far away place in a community newspaper serving [the local community].

Another editor recalled the case of the Columbine High School shootings in Colorado. The shootings caused great shock and sadness throughout the United States, and the editors I interviewed mentioned, without fail, the immense emotional outpouring in the form of letters that resulted from the occurrence. To the editor discussing the Columbine letters, the notion of the “local” was a crucial criterion for selection, but his was a more philosophical twist on the concept:

editors. And indeed, some of those who voiced their concerns on the pages of The Masthead spoke of their letters feature as the only, and much-needed, site of communication with readers. As Ryon (1992) suggested, the “most signicant contact many of us have with our readers is through their letters to the editor” (p. 3).

Nevertheless, it excludes any out-of-town contributions that may be of interest or concern to members of the community. By such exclusiveness, necessary for the efcient operation of the newspaper, the rule clashes with the vision of universal access embodied in the thought of deliberative democrats; the idea that “all those concerned” with an issue may have a voice in the debate. It poignantly identies one of the key problems of the press as a democratic institution: the selectivity that makes it exclusive, rather than inclusive of all voices.

# The Rule of Entertainment

His reection captures the power of public discourse on topics that emotionally engage participants, and such emotional engagement is central to his understanding of the local; that which “touches home”. In his story, relevance is a complex concept that has more to do with passion than with public interest.

Editors often explained their preference for locally generated content by arguing that it fosters a higher quality of debate. Local letters, they argue, create more of a “back and forth”, as one editorial assistant for a San Francisco alternative weekly paper put it, because readers can more readily and immediately identify with the topic and with the writer of the letter. This rule makes sense if the letters section is conceived primarily as a site for readers to commune with other readers, journalists and

In an article that succinctly demonstrates the concerns of many letters editors, Kingsley Guy (1992) of the Sun-Sentinel (Florida) argued that “newspapers are in danger of becoming irrelevant because they are failing to meet the amusing illustrations in the form of syndicated cartoons, and a more appealing format” (p. 9). The basis for this editor’s gripes with lengthy letters lies in the problem of keeping up with the competition in a media marketplace characterised by an emphasis on entertainment. This worry is echoed by other editors, who suggest the letters feature may be an endangered species because owners of newspapers fail to see the connection between its existence and commercial success (cf. also Hynds, 1994). In this view, the feature needs to move beyond “bland, boring, and humorless” discussion that merely provides a “grueling kind of sameness” (Anderson, 1990, p. 4). Newspapers can turn on readers by offering more sparkly, entertaining op-ed pages and letters sections. They “ought to be ame throwers; there are too many pilot lights that don’t even singe your ngers when you touch them”, offered one editorial writer (Anderson, 1990, p. 3). As one editor of a local weekly known for its letters page suggested, “some people like a local newspaper basically because of the spiciness of the letters”.

By throwing ames and spicing up the news, papers deprioritise civility and the presumption of rational discussion that underlies deliberative democratic theory. In its place, they institutionalise the punch of hard-hitting entertainment that might emotionally re up readers, but might also, by its more agonistic nature, endanger the pursuit of shared understanding and empathy that deliberative democrats view as so central to public discourse. Such worries for the health of public discourse under the regime of entertainment do not merely burden deliberative democrats, but constitute, as McNair (2000) points out, the “prevailing scholarly and critical orthodoxy” (p. 209) on political communication in general, and journalism in particular. McNair (2000) has suggested that critics rally against

As McNair pointed out, however, critics of political journalism are too quick to denounce a set of complex developments that come out of the increasingly commercial imperative of the press, but may result in a journalism that is more in tune with the needs of the public, and more effectively places power holders under the sharp light of publicity. Moreover, entertaining letters can capture the imaginations of audiences and engage them with topics of common concern; it can bring a public to life. Sparking debate is, indeed, the editors’ prime objective. Thus, one editor described his delight with receiving letters from rst-time writers: “I like any debate that engenders response from people … [Writing a letter for the rst time] means that our newspaper has sparked them to want to communicate in a way that they never did before.”

While deliberative democrats may condemn a form of debate that primarily entertains and provokes rather than bringing about rational discussion, the editors shows the ip side of this argument: they suggest that entertainment can be one powerful way to create and fuel a public debate (see also Wahl-Jorgensen, 2001a). Thus, neither entertainment nor brevity are, in themselves, necessarily counterproductive to public discourse. Indeed, they might foster added involvement and understanding of the situation of others, which are among the most important ends of deliberative democratic theory.

# The Rule of Brevity: bite-size debate

The rule of entertainment is closely related to a third requirement for letters: they must be both short and sweet. Most papers strictly enforce a 300-word limit on letters to the editor, so as to allow for the greatest number of individuals to voice their opinion, and to do so in a succinct and punchy fashion. Though the rule of brevity has governed the letters section during at least the past 30 years, the demand for increasing the number of letters and decreasing the “bulk” of individual (and more entertaining) ones has grown stronger.4 USA Today, the national US newspaper at the forefront of print media’s turn to bite-size information, now cuts all its letters down to 100 words or less, and many other papers studied in the interviews and Masthead articles are following suit, or at the very least limiting contributions to 150 words.

The smaller the bites, the argument goes, the more of them we can swallow. As Guy (1992) suggested, he’d “rather see 10 letters of 100 words than four of $2 5 0 ^ { \prime \prime }$ (p. 9). Guy argued that by enforcing a maximum limit of 250 words editors express their willingness to say no to “writers who think they have a God-given right to fulminate ad nauseam”. “Hey, newsprint is expensive,” Guy complained (p. 9). This approach ultimately protects the quantity of individual expression, rather than the quality and depth of argument. The bite-size debate approach expresses the desire to hear the opinions of as many persons as possible. As one editorial assistant for an alternative weekly put it, “we try and get as many people’s voices in the paper as possible, so really short”. This means that newspapers put the premium on a diversity of names tagged onto opinions, rather than the opinions themselves. What this approach ignores, however, is the importance of occasionally transcending self-interest in favour of the shared interest that comes about when a variety of opinions are heard. This approach places the burden on the minority opinions— those who have valuable, but undervalued views will not have the same opportunity to voice their concerns in the letters sections as the voices of privilege; the voices of the majority who can ood the editor with contributions.

Another implication of the 300-or-less word limit, interlocking with the rule of relevance, is that it becomes difcult for newspaper readers to engage in detailed deliberation. It is not feasible to develop more than a truncated discussion of an issue in 300 words. A far cry from the intersubjective rational-critical discussion envisioned by Habermas, the limit sets the stage for a discursive situation in which “the public is allowed to respond by acclamation— or by withholding acclamation—but the public is not expected to respond substantively and discursively” (Salmon and Glasser, 1995, p. 446). Editors suggested, however, that short letters can be optimally politically efcacious, because they actually engender more interest than longer ones. One editor for a successful local bi-weekly newspaper put it as follows:

The rule of brevity is an earnest attempt to address a fundamental reality of newspaper production: the limited time and space available for writing; the “news hole”. Within the constraints of a rationalised business (cf. Hardt, 1998, p. 179) the newsworkers are struggling to open up a site for citizens to speak, alongside the voices of the already privileged elite.

# The Rule of Authority: cultural capital as entrance requirement

Though editors readily identied the rules discussed above, they denied any editorial bias toward particular opinions or individuals. As one editor for a local weekly suggested, “for me to say, well, I favour one letter over another would indicate a bias and would indicate I would give more space to one issue over another because I like it. That would be unethical in my view.” Indeed, almost all the editors interviewed stressed the importance of avoiding the appearance of preferring particular points of view over others, and extolled the virtues of a “balanced letters page”. However, an examination of a fourth rule, referred to as the “rule of authority”, reveals a subtle proclivity for the words of authority. This rule is perhaps the most slippery one, since its existence is often denied—and rightfully so: it is not based on a conscious choice, but is built into the structure of the newspaper business, which depends on eloquence and readability for its success. It has to do with selecting culturally specic forms of competence for participation in public conversations. This rule rears its head in two ways; one overt, and one covert. And while the overt manifestation of the rule seems a thing of the past, its covert form is still alive and well.

The overt expression of the rule of authority, evident only in Masthead issues from more than 25 years ago, captures the idea that letters editors, as one of them put it, “will give some preference to letters from persons of authority or deep experience” (cf. Cherniss, 1968, p. 15). For example, while Hap Cawood (1976) of the Dayton Daily News argued against the publication of the words of “illiterates” and “madmen” (p. 15), Carl Andrews of the Rocanoha (Virginia) World-News (1968) shared his elation over the occasional “letter of unusual importance, particularly from a prominent person” (p. 13). This proclivity, then, elevated the display of excellence in the letters section over the ability to transcend self-interest and social status so central to the egalitarian premises of deliberative democracy.

However, such remarks have disappeared in the face of powerful counter-arguments from those in favour of cultural diversity. Indeed, since 1990, editors have argued against the bias for the words of the powerful. Thus, one editor suggested that “robust discussion of public issues should characterize the editorial page. Who would live in a community where the only ‘facts’ that could be expressed were those certied by a higher authority? … The challenge is to nd new voices and to give space to people who are not just the easily recognised political and civic leaders” (Phillips, 1990, p. 9). Ringham (1990) proposed that the letters section “gives voice to people who don’t usually have one, or who don’t usually choose to use it”, (p. 11) while Runyon (1990) argued that “op-ed pages should no longer be a matter of prestige, nor should they be a last bastion for elitist ponticating. At their best, they hold the pulse of the community and the region” (p. 12). Concerns for diversity have become an increasingly central part of the editors’ selfunderstanding, and have inuenced their practices profoundly.

Nevertheless, the consensus of editors appears to be that the ideal contributor to the letters page is the “informed outsider” (Clark, 1990) who knows how to write well. Indeed, as one editorial assistant for an alternative weekly expressed it in the interview, the rule of authority is underwritten by common sense: “Letters that are well written do stand out. I think that does add to your cause because like everything in the paper, interesting letters are better than boring letters, well written letters are better than poorly written letters.” And herein lies the more covert and complex manifestation of the rule of authority, which embodies the desire for letters that adhere to cultural standards of eloquence and expertise. To gain such status, one needs more than the basic competencies to speak and act that Habermas and other scholars of deliberative democracy see as the criteria of qualication for participation. As journalism scholar Bohle (1991) noted, it is not enough to have things to say; one also needs a background of skill to say it. Broadly speaking, editors are concerned with three different, yet intertwined kinds of “cultural competencies” (Bourdieu, 1984, p. 2) or knowledge of decoding and encoding practices: spelling, grammar, and persuasiveness. One needs to be well versed in hegemonic standards of expression, but also knowledgeable on the topic under discussion.

The rule of authority, manifested in the requirement for linguistic eloquence, is problematic for two different reasons. First of all, it excludes a large proportion of letter writers from getting their opinions published. Geoff Seamans (1992), of the Roanoke Times and WorldNews (Virginia) wrote that “though a reasonably literate critical letter is likely to be published, we publish only about half the letters we get” (p. 8). A study by journalism scholars Suraj Kapoor and Carl Botan (1992) indicated that about one-half of editors use grammar as a factor in their decision making. Secondly, the demand for competence may exclude a large proportion of the public from participating in the process of letter writing a priori. As Bourdieu (1984) pointed out, the knowledge of cultural practices, or “cultural competence”, is closely linked to educational capital, measured by formal qualications and social origin. It is, then, necessary to know the rules of the culture to play the game of democracy, and mastery of these rules is restricted to those privileged by their backgrounds. This means that the balance of the letters pages, despite a genuine desire for diversity, privileges those with ample cultural capital: as most studies of letter writers indicate, the column is dominated by white, middle-aged and well-educated males who are rmly situated in a community and have the excess time and energy required for a commitment to political activism (cf. Sparks and Perez, 1991). The subtle bias induced by the “rule of authority” points to the slippery nature of “competence” as a normative criterion for inclusion in public debate, and demonstrates the impossibility of entirely leaving social status out of the public forum: competence is a culturally specic concept, and is closely related to social and economic privilege.

Even if editors wish to include everyone in the discussion, regardless of their background, they cannot, under the current constraints of the newspaper, include those who lack basic competencies, as dened within the culture of the newsroom. Thus, social status becomes an entrance variable for public participation. This shows a problem in the thought of deliberative democrats: supposedly neutral rules for entry into the public sphere, such as basic competencies in writing, are ultimately grounded in culturally specic understandings .

# Rethinking Letters to the Editor

The nature of the letters section precludes the kind of universal access to intersubjective public deliberation that Habermas and other deliberative democrats call for: the public debate of the letters section is a constructed creature, pieced together by selected opinions and voices, appearing on a regular, but not immediate basis, in response to news items. The four rules identied here create an exclusive public forum that, despite the best efforts of editors, often works against the diversity of expression. The ndings of the paper caution us against relying merely on rules to create expressive justice, proving right Fraser’s (1992) admonition that “protocols of style and decorum [are] themselves correlates and markers of status inequality” (p. 119).

All of the rules identied here are, in the editors’ views, necessary for the smooth running of the letters section. As we have seen, the rules of relevance and entertainment can, in some situations, help to foster debate, and give us grounds to question the deliberative democrats’ focus on rationality to the exclusion of fun, feelings, spectacle and solidarity. But we have also seen that the rules of brevity and authority are the enemies of egalitarian intersubjective deliberation: while the rule of authority might squash the voices of the underprivileged from the get-go, the rule of brevity truncates the detailed discussion we need to come to an informed agreement. As such, these rules ought to be challenged or, at the very least, understood more exibly in the culture of the newsroom.

Because of the interplay of these rules, the letters section can, at best, offer a necessary mechanism of accountability and legitimation for the newspaper, composed to maximise its success in the market. As Thornton (1998) has suggested, the letters page can be the site for an “ongoing conversation about journalism” (p. 37). It represents the privatised understanding of public opinion as the sum aggregate of individual opinions: the idea that if we add up all individual gripes, we will understand how the “public” feels. This is a thin understanding of public opinion formation, and one that we ought to rethink.

Theories of deliberative democracy offer a vision of communicative action that emphasises dialogue and calls for the active participation of media institutions in providing opportunities for critical debate. When applied to letters to the editor, this body of work indicates that debate cannot ourish unless everyone affected by that debate can participate. Hence, this application of the deliberative approach points to the need for a proactive effort on behalf of the media to seek out a diversity of voices. More than that, it shows the necessity for providing assistance to those who are usually left out of the debate because they lack the kind of competencies required to gain a voice. Also, the issues taken up by the debating citizens of the public sphere should not be limited to “current events” and news items on a media agenda; on the contrary, the subjects of debate should include the core premises and structures of society.

James Carey (1997) suggests that the press must “support the maintenance of public space and public life; it must nd ways in which the public can address one another, and it must enhance those qualities of discourse such as decent manners and formal social equality that allow public space to develop and to be maintained” (pp. 12–13). Key to such an effort would be to raise the question of how to hear the silent, clumsy and messy citizens.

A realisation of the ideals of deliberative democracy would require radical changes in the operation of news organisations, and is probably too much to hope for. Nevertheless, there is evidence that journalists are transcending the rules of selection in their practices, in recognition of their problems. Some editors acknowledged the necessity for more detailed inquiry that can afford to be oblivious to word limits. Carter (1992) suggested that a “wellwritten, well-reasoned letter that is over your word limit can be used as a guest column” (p. 10). The practice of inviting community members into the pages and assisting them with the process of expression is a step in the right direction, and a fairly common one (cf. Kirwan, 1991, p. 18). The conscious choice of guest columnists from a variety of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds could bring more diversity to the op-ed pages and provide an avenue of compensation for the unequal distribution of cultural capital (cf. Overholser, 1992, p. 19).

Perhaps most importantly, recent years have witnessed hopeful developments towards making newspapers more sensitive to their communities. In particular, the public journalism movement has taken important steps toward improving public life through the institution of journalism. Jay Rosen (1991), one of the foremost proponents of the movement, urges that

We can try to nd ways to engage more citizens in public life while we make public life more engaging. We can encourage serious discourse to become “more public” while we make public discourse more serious. (p. 269)

While the public journalism movement does not set out to solve all that is rotten in the state of newspapers (cf. Hardt, 1999), it has brought about a genuine concern for reforming journalism to better serve the public. The consciousness that the public is worth worrying about is an indispensable step in the right direction, and it is one that goes hand in hand with reworking the letters section to allow for a greater variety of voices.

# Notes

1 This is the estimation of editors interviewed for this study.   
2 Please note that for reasons of condentiality, names of editors and their papers are not disclosed here, although other information (e.g. size of paper, nature of editors’ position) is included when deemed signicant.   
3 Please note that in the following sections, when citing articles written by editors in The Masthead, these individuals are identied not only by name, but also by the name of the newspaper for which they were working at the time of writing. This, however, does not imply that they can presently be found at that publication. First of all, the articles picked for analysis go back to the 1960s. Secondly, the newspaper industry is one marked by high turnover rates, and nally, some of the newspapers mentioned here have long since folded. Cf. Dix (1968) and Craig (1968), who both write, in 1968, that, as letters editors, they limit contributions to 200 words. See also Hynds (1994) and Kapoor and Botan (1992) for a discussion of the almost universal 300-word limit.
