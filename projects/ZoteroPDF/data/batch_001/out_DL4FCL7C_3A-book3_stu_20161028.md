# The Project

Funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust and spearheaded by The Open University of Hong Kong, the Open Textbooks for Hong Kong project aims to pioneer collaborative production and sharing of copyright free open textbooks among teachers and students at primary, secondary and tertiary levels in Hong Kong. These digitized textbooks are accessible online at no cost and are available in affordable printed copies through recommended printing shops.

All textbooks in the project adopt a Creative Commons license, which means that the owners of the textbooks retain the ownership of content, but grant the right in advance to others so that the content may be revised, reused, remixed and customized, and redistributed. These open textbooks therefore allow teachers to tailor the content to their course.

In addition to adopting open textbooks owned by others, the project has itself produced Hong Kong’s first free of charge open textbook series, Open English (for Primary 1 to Primary 6, and Secondary 1 to Secondary 6), which is specially designed for primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong in accordance to the HKSAR’s English Language curriculum. Printed versions of Open English can be used in schools in tandem with their e-versions. Teachers can also customize Open English to produce their own version in order suit their students' need.

# The Open University of Hong Kong (OuhK)

The OUHK is the only government established self-financing tertiary institution in Hong Kong. Since inception in 1989, it has stayed true to its mission of Education for All by offering education opportunities to aspiring learners, benefitting over 100,000 graduates. The OUHK launched its first full-time programmes in 2001, and became part of the Joint University Programmes Admission System (JUPAS) in 2007. Currently, the OUHK has a population of nearly 20,000, about evenly distributed between full-time and part-time programmes. Its full-time students make up one sixth of the university student population in Hong Kong.

The OUHK is one of the few self-financing institutions in the territory which enjoys selfaccrediting status granted by the Government and its academic and teaching quality is widely recognized. To meet society's needs, the University has in recent years invested additional resources in the development of professional and practical programmes, among them are our signature programmes in nursing and healthcare, creative arts, childhood education, business administration and testing and certification. These programmes are highly acclaimed by both the industry and the general public, nurturing high-calibre talent to benefit the society.
