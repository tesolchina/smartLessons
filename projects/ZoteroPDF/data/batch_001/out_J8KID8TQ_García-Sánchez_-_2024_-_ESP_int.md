# ABSTRACT

This research explores intralinguistic communicative mediation in an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) online journal writing to enhance professional development through the co-construction of meaning. It accentuates research gaps specific to learning English in the field of law under the approach of collaborative Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and the Vygotskian pedagogical model of semiotic mediation with tools. The online journal writing allowed learners not only to engage in the discussions but to develop cognitive messages expressed at levels $B 1 + / \mathsf { B } 2$ of the Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR). The 69 participants were ESP students of English Law, a compulsory subject in a professional accredited university master’s degree in law, needed to work in Spain. The findings revealed that the three main strategies for knowledge building and intraliguistic communicative mediation were: linking to previous knowledge (class content or other), adapting the language, and breaking down complicated information. Moreover, the collaborative journal writing reinforced students’ accuracy on expert vocabulary learning through purpose-driven mediation of texts, concepts, and communication in the context of law. Further results indicated that collaborative journal writing was an effective pedagogical tool to make meaning for ESP through different interactive affordances of mediation (linguistic, cultural, social, pedagogical, and professional) by comparing legal contexts from Spain, the United Kingdom and United States.

# Introduction

Mediation is a term fundamentally linked to cognitive development, coined by the Vygotskian sociocultural theory of learning. It highlights that knowledge is created by interacting with the world, through cultural resources or artefacts and especially through the role of language as the primary mental tool for mediation (Azadi, Biria, & Nasri, 2018; Moll, 2000; Thompson, 2013; Vygotsky, 1981). In English language education, intralinguistic mediation (English to English) functions as a constant and necessary skill so that communication occurs among L2 peers. In today’s global, multicultural, and multilingual world, university English for Specific Purposes (ESP) students and life-long learning professionals must mediate ubiquitous worldwide knowledge, which is applied to their expertise and influenced by technological advances. Appropriate technological tools should therefore be integrated to foster ESP learning.

Moreover, the latest version of the Common European Framework of References for Languages, Companion Volume (CEFR CV, 2020) has delved into the concept of linguistic, cultural, social, pedagogical, and professional mediation as both a communicative language activity and a communicative language strategy. This implies a considerable progress in the communicative approach now that mediation and interaction have been acknowledged as key in the communicative learning process of a foreign language (Piccardo, North, & Goodier, 2019).

The current study examines research gaps, specific to learning ESP under the framework of collaborative Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and the Vygotskian concept of mediation, which is discussed in line with the latest interpretations of the CEFR CV (2020). Mediation, thus, is described as a communicative language competence that establishes a constructive dialogue between the self and the community through social interaction or the exchange of ideas/concepts in the professional field of law (Guerrero Nieto, 2007). To that end, the meaning of mediation, here, deals with linguistic communication and learning ESP, both autonomously and collaboratively through journal writing. The initial hypothesis is that the communicative learning design of the collaborative journal writing task must be clearly ingrained with purposive content, instructions, and goals. This learning project affords the enhancement of intralinguistic communicative mediation so that the ESP learning community can actively interact and contribute to their specific knowledge building through the written artefacts or messages produced by 69 participants. The online journal writing is presented as the asynchronous CALL tool for semiotic mediation in two directions: between the individual and the community and between the teacher and the individual-community. This research is, therefore, guided by the following related questions:

RQ1. What communicative mediation strategies were used by ESP students to co-construct meaning and develop conceptual language and expert vocabulary for the law profession?

RQ2. From a pedagogical perspective, which intralinguistic mediation affordances were performed on the journal writing task?

# Collaborative CALL and online interactions

Several scholars have argued that present communication is technology-mediated, computer-supported, constructive, multimodal, and multidimensional, since learners participate in both synchronous (with tools that imitate face-to-face communication in real-time, e.g. a video call) and asynchronous (e.g. a discussion forum) engaging environments (Dillenbourg & Tchounikine, 2007; Kim, 2013; Peng, Zhang, & Chen, 2017; Roschelle, 2020; Valeiras-Jurado & Moll, 2020). Among the affordances of synchronous and asynchronous CALL (autonomous vs collaborative; formal vs informal; onsite vs online), online communication is crucial to extend the possibilities of language learning outside the formal, planned classroom, not only individually but collaboratively and with a professional, formative goal (García-Sánchez, 2015; Kessler & Bikowski, 2010; Smith & Craig, 2013; Su & Zou, 2020). Thus, online communication inevitably involves collaboration to engage learners in specific meaningful conversations and immersive interactive experiences (Piccardo & North, 2019).

Correspondingly, collaboration implies a mutual coordination and engagement of participants to accomplish the learning task (Dillenbourg & Tchounikine, 2007; Oxford, 1997; Roschelle, 2020). Research has shown that collaborative tasks are group-based and carefully planned with the intention of developing skills and constructing meaning rather than form (Alghasab, Hardman, & Handley, 2019; Bygate, 2016; Hsieh, 2017). Further, as Kukulska‐Hulme and Viberg (2018) revealed in their literature review the benefits of mobile collaborative language learning resulted in some purposeful affordances such as flexibility, continuity, timely feedback, self-efficacy, self-evaluation, and orthographic awareness, among others. Either way, collaborative CALL, therefore, aims at enhancing engaging interactions, which are linked, shared, and negotiated while knowledge is created by the community members in authentic learning environments (Kim, 2013; Shadiev, Liu, & Hwang, 2020; Yeni-Palabiyik & Daloglu, 2016).

Given that collaborative language learning was founded in social constructivism, there is a significant link between the individual or personal and the community or social. The implementation of the Vygotskian theory in a collaborative language learning environment accentuates the need for cognitive development through social interactions so that mediation between the internal (mind) and the external (other, the world, the learning community) spheres occur (Daniels, 2001;

Guerrero Nieto, 2007; Newman & Latifi, 2021). In doing so, learning ‘is not an isolated act of cognition, but rather a process of interaction via mediation through which learners learn as other participants such as teachers and peers assist them to learn’ (Azadi et  al., 2018, p. 133). Vygotsky emphasised this social engagement between the learner and the community through cultural tools such as speech as paramount in any communicative learning approach. This entails extending the discussion towards the original Vygotskian perspective on mediation and cultural/social interactive learning (Vygotsky, 1981, 1986), and the more recent implications of mediation as an activity and a strategy by the CEFR CV (2020).

# ESP mediation and the (co-)construction of meaning

There is a meaningful transition regarding mediation from the initial Vygotskian claims to the more recent interpretations of the CEFR CV (2020). In the latter, mediation is defined as a communicative language strategy, an activity, and even a competence or function that together with reception, production, and interaction facilitates communication or interpretation of messages between two or more speakers or groups. As an activity, mediation implies that learners/agents/users can mediate texts, concepts, and communication, and therefore interpret and explain in their own words. As a language strategy, the most recent changes of the CEFR CV distinguish five strategies for mediation: (1) it can link to previous knowledge, (2) it can adapt language, (3) it can break down complicated information, (4) it can amplify a dense text and (5) it can update a text. Likewise, mediation combines reception, production, and interaction, not just to communicate but to develop a message in the foreign language.

In Vygotskian ontological implications, mediation addresses the notion that we cannot act directly upon the world but only by way of cultural artefacts (discursive, material, symbolic…). Semiotic mediation is therefore described as knowledge construction due to social interactions through the students’ Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky, 1978). ZPD is the gap between students’ ‘actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving’ and their ‘potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers’ (Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86).

On the same note, Daniels and Tse (2021) argued that, in the original conceptualisation of mediation, Vygotsky’s ‘was concerned with the ways in which cultural tools or artefacts, such as speech, mediate engagement between the social and the personal’ (5). The link between the individual and the social is preserved since mediation highlights the ‘two key notions of co-construction of meaning in interaction and constant movement between the individual and the social in language learning’ (North & Piccardo, 2016, p. 36), which Vygotsky advocated long ago (Piccardo et  al., 2019; Vygotsky, 1978, 1986).

Besides, Vygotsky had already determined that the individual was an active agent in development (this is now emphasised in the CEFR CV) and that mediation takes place through the context and the tools provided at a particular time and in a particular place. The user/learner, as an active social agent, (co-)builds meaning while engaging with others. On the other hand, as a social agent, the user/learner produces communicative messages (or artefacts) by combining the individual and the social domains so that linguistic, sociolinguistic, and pragmatic communicative language competences take place (North, 2016; Piccardo & North, 2019; Vygotsky, 1978, 1986). Daniels and Tse (2021) claimed that due to social, cultural, and historical circumstances, ‘different language modalities and specialised mediational properties emerge’ (9). This implies that interpersonal, social exchanges of thoughts are shaped providing the specific experiential context (e.g. law situations/cases).

Additionally, several studies have addressed that mediation adds a real-time situation, a cultural-social experience to communicate in the foreign language (Gimenez, 2020; Peng et  al., 2017; Porto, 2019) through the general competences of knowledge (savoir) or know-how (savoir-faire) and the existential competence (savoir-etre). Mediation, thus, is defined as the most advanced competence in an autonomous learner, ‘the ability to learn’ (savoir apprendre), as explained in the CEFR CV (Figure 1). Learning English through mediation envisions a constructive, changeable, circular method, which corresponds with learners’ needs, real-life tasks, and language acquisition (CEFR CV, 2020; North & Piccardo, 2016).

Founded upon the above arguments, mediation, in the present study, is expanded to a more extensive scope and in a social dimension for the construction or reformulation of a written message using key expressions applied to the students’ professional field.

Figure 1. M ediation as language competence for ‘the ability to learn’ (CEFR CV, 2020).

Learning, therefore, is defined as a dynamic communicative process in which (co-constructive, social/cultural) mediation and interactions are required. In this learning cycle, the teacher’s role, as an expert in ESP, is to design the task and then, supervise, guide, and explain the semiotic potential of learners towards specific goals. The teacher-researcher, who uses the artefact of the collaborative journal writing as a tool of semiotic mediation, must design the task to bridge the individual and social perspectives. Hence, the students can be engaged in individual written production with reflections, reports and interpretations that are shared in the collaborative journal writing.

# Methodology

This exploratory qualitative research was framed within a collaborative CALL case study and relied on online journal writing. As a case study outline, learners’ intralinguistic written mediation was concerned with communication and ESP knowledge (co-) building set in the professional field of law at levels $\mathrm { B } 1 + / \mathrm { B } 2$ of the Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR). On the one hand, an analytical approach was used to rigorously code and compare the data and classify the students’ mediation strategies through the co-construction of specific meaning. On the other hand, collaborative journal writing was introduced as a task model to enhance linguistic, cultural, social, pedagogical, and professional mediation for English language learning and cognitive development.

The ESP educational community was contextualised in their professional legal field comparing Spanish legal cases and legislation with those based on the United Kingdom and the United States. Journal writing was therefore described as an interactive communicative task for learners to co-construct their ESP written contributions and mediate/ understand the language from a professional perspective through collaborative CALL.

# Participants

The participants were 69 postgraduate students, 26 men and 43 women, in the compulsory ESP course English law of a master’s degree in Law, a necessary qualification for them to work as lawyers in Spain. This subject offered 4.5 ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System) credits in English, which meant having 45 synchronous teaching-learning hours and around 67 hours of out-of-class independent, cooperative, and collaborative learning. The interactive online lessons were divided into seven full weeks with six intensive hours organised in 3 days a week, as well as two other weeks with 2 hours each. The online platform used for the synchronous interactive sessions was MS Teams, which was supported by Moodle with guidelines for the course content, the tasks, and the assessment. The collaborative journal writing task had an asynchronous forum design on Moodle. Because of the Covid-19, this subject had to be offered fully online in the academic year 2020–2021.

# Task design

As a collaborative learning task, the journal writing (JW) demanded careful planning to engage learners in building meaningful written texts. There was a correspondence between the course syllabi and the topics prompted in the journal writing task. Based on the legal content of the United Kingdom and the United States, the six learning units covered the ESP linguistic perspective, as shown in Table 1. This course syllabi implied facing inter- and intra-linguistic communicative mediation with frequent comparisons between the Spanish legal concepts, situations, and processes and those pertained to the UK and the US. The JW entries were, therefore, linked to the ESP course content with further reflections, case studies, comments and information students could add, while dealing with different cultural legal scenarios. Table 1 shows this correspondence between the course content and the discussions elicited in the JW task. Moreover, it includes the number of students voluntarily assigned to each collaborative JW and the types of intralinguistic mediation expected in each situation:

Each JW, which was co-produced by the learners of each collaborative group and posted on the forum, elicited the use of the mediation strategies proposed by the CEFR CV (2020), especially those addressing the link to previous knowledge (class or other), the adaptation of language and the breaking down complicated information with further examples and explanations. At the same time, each JW was intentionally prompted by the instructor with specific questions, words to enhance semiotic professional mediation for English language learning and cognitive development (Vygotsky, 1978), as it can be seen in the Appendix. This was determined by the ZPD so that learners could enhance their writing performance and develop their potential through communicative mediation, peer-to-peer interaction, and the teacher’s guidance.

JW0 (Figure 2) was first explained in class and then posted on the Moodle forum, providing learners with instructions and some suggestions/tips to successfully complete the written assignment. Also, a sample journal writing paragraph was provided by the teacher. The instructions explained that participants had to be concise and write between 100–120 words on the topic chosen, adding personal and/or professional references (in past, present and/or future), whenever possible. Optionally, they could add multimodal materials to support or extend their work (e.g. links to videos, documents, or photos). This assignment ( $1 0 \%$ assessment) was marked by the teacher with constructive feedback regarding both content and language. For the latter, the corrected mistakes were differentiated in red and the good practice (correct language

structures, ESP vocabulary or collocations and orthography, for instance) in blue.

Once the JW0 was posted on the Moodle forum, the six topics were organised in smaller collaborative learning groups with prompts that addressed specific vocabulary, situations or questions related to law so that the 69 students contributed to the online task at least once. To do so, the participants were encouraged to choose the topic for them to engage in the collaborative journal writing. The teacher/ researcher, then, noted down the names proposed voluntarily for each JW situation (JW1-6) to ensure all students were involved in the task (Table 1).

JW1 addressed the topic of Legal English vocabulary with the use of 20 ESP concepts and collocations (lawyer, attorney, litigation, qualified, right of audience, practise, barristers, law firm, appear, solicitors, clients, judge, legal practise, advocacy, pleading a case, partnership, training contract, acting for, represent, specialise) previously introduced in class. Every voluntary student (ten) was then assigned four different concepts so that they could build different contextualised paragraphs including those ESP terms. JW2 required ten different students to do some research about 10 types of law (law of contract; commercial law; company law; land law; law of tort; law of equity and trusts; employment law; family law; criminal law; international law) so that participants could connect to previous knowledge and explain their preference in the type of law firm they would like to work in. JW3 was based on an online flipped class about British English and American English differences. Five students volunteered to watch this video so that they mediated this audio-visual document and linked it to their experiences regarding English language learning and its application in the legal professional field. JW4 was oriented to the skill of English public speaking and delivery, linked to learners’ personal and professional reflections, with questions such as: How often do you deliver speeches in English? Who is your audience? Have you ever used English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) with other international speakers in a meeting/course? Six students participated in this post. JW5 dealt with another interesting topic that allowed thirteen new, volunteering postgraduates to mediate with communication and learning by comparing differences between the Spanish legal system versus the American and British legal schemes. Finally, JW6 covered both concept and communicative written mediation through different tort law cases such as negligence, trespass to land/to a person, nuisance, defamation, false imprisonment, libel, and slander, for instance. Twenty-five participants built a case based on those tort types or provided examples of popular past cases set in Spain, the UK, or the US.

# Instruments and data

The data collected from the journal writing forum was classified according to topics, number of students participating in each JW, the mediation strategies used and the types of intralinguistic written mediation activities: texts, concepts, or communication (Table 1). Since students chose the topic of their preference themselves, the subject with the highest number of collaborative interventions was JW6 with 25 students’ contributions, followed by JW5 (13 learners). JW1 and JW2 had the same number of contributions (10 each). Next, JW4, related to public speaking in law, contained six contributions, and JW3 was the topic with less contributions (5), as shown in Table 1.

Together with the students’ contributions, the teacher’s feedback and peer-to-peer interaction were considered for data analysis. Every contribution was marked by the teacher and shared on the platform with the intention of improving all learners’ intralinguistic written mediation by highlighting accurate ESP expressions and constructions, together with common mistakes. A few examples of interaction were performed by students.

# Findings

This section focuses on the qualitative data analysed towards intralinguistic communicative mediation in the professional field of legal English through online journal writing. The findings confirm the 69 students performed written mediation through contextualised reported paragraphs in ESP. It is observed that this intralinguistic written mediation necessarily developed both input (reception) and output (production) communicative activities, also supported by the pedagogical approach, the teacher’s feedback, and peer-to-peer interaction. No examples of interlinguistic written mediation between Spanish and English were reported. The results are discussed in line with the research questions posed.

RQ1. What communicative mediation strategies were used by ESP students to co-construct meaning and develop conceptual language and expert vocabulary for the law profession?

Students’ overall intralinguistic mediation was bolstered with complex structures, and accurate collocations or expert vocabulary at level $\mathrm { B } 1 { + } /$ B2 as shown in Table 2. The ESP participants could make themselves understood with elaborated cognitive messages that were similarly co-produced in each JW. Table 2 shows the findings addressing the mediation strategies used and the examples of mediation of concepts (tort law; act for a client; commercial law…); mediation of cases or texts (pre-nuptial contracts; a rental agreement…) and written communication (I would work for an international firm; If I could imagine myself in 5 years…). A dialogic constructive discourse of interpersonal or social and intrapersonal or individual engaging mediation was produced in the journal writing task.

Based on the CEFR CV (2020), the results revealed that the three main mediation strategies employed by the 69 participants while co-constructing meaning were: linking to previous and additional ESP knowledge (class and out-of-class content), adapting language to contexts, and breaking down complicated information with further examples and explanations. Learners were driven to practise these mediation techniques since they were prompted in the JW instructions. It is believed that the two other mediation strategies for amplifying or updating a text (CEFR CV, 2020), were not produced because the task design did not encourage them.

The first strategy of linking the content to previous or additional information was performed by all students through frequent interactions of intralinguistic mediation mostly in JW5 and JW6 as shown in the extracts below. As part of the journal writing design, learners referred to different law areas (ESP professional knowledge) and reported on tort cases, providing examples of definite cultural locations (Spain, the UK, the US, and Australia). These social constructive references significantly shaped expert vocabulary building (zero-hour contract; tort law; contractual obligation; breach of contract; a civil wrong…) and writing mediation performance in the field of law. The extracts illustrate students’ original versions without any marking:

St1. If you’re pretending to move to the UK, it’s important that you know about the existence of the polemical “zero-hour contract”. This type of contract doesn’t reflect the working hours that will be done and the employee must be prepared to work whenever he’s required to. In this type of contract, you only get paid for the hours you have worked and it’s very typical in the retail and catering areas…

St2. The tort law in the United States is completely different from the model implemented in Europe, because there is no specific rule that regulates this matter in a general way in the country. As for the basic structure there is a great uniformity between the states, except for Louisiana…

St3. In which category could we introduce a vehicle accident? A contractual or non-contractual obligation? The tort law, as a fundamental legal category of private law, is a non-contractual obligation arisen from a civil wrong that causes harm or damage to the other party, just as it occurs in a vehicle accident. In this case, it cannot be considered a crime (criminal matter) by itself, nor a breach of contract, because it does not exist a contractual relationship between the parties…

The second mediation strategy of adapting the language was used by all students in all JW1-6 through interpreting, paraphrasing, and summarising. It is important to report that the mediation of tort cases (JW6) especially implied this adaptation of the English language to the legal professional context. There were incidents of plagiarism so that three students had to resubmit their work without committing this intellectual offence. Moreover, in JW1-2 and in JW5-6, students not only adapted the language but also mediated different legal systems and cultures (the UK, the US, Spain), as seen in examples St4 and St5.

St.4. This occurs because the extra-contractual civil liability is inspired by English common law, where it is the judge himself who takes into account the decisions of other states and federal courts. In addition, they usually follow the tort rules proposed in the Restatement of Torts…

St.5. I think to be hired by a law firm will be very difficult due to my age. On the other hand, I love employment law and I could enter into a partnership with my brother (judicial medical expert) in order to issue claims about disabilities,

Social Security rights, etc. But I also doubt about this idea since I should learn to pleading a case first and ask some solicitors…

The third mediation strategy of breaking down complicated information with examples and explanatory comments was developed by all learners in all JW (1-6). Obviously, there were frequent examples of this strategy when making comparisons with Spain (e.g. drafting a claim; the zero-hour contract; a donation contract). Some examples from JW4, which are presented as they were posted on the forum, are illustrated below:

St6. Last year, I signed a training contract with a law firm. One of the lawyers asked me to draft a claim about a breach of a donation contract by the donor. Unlike in Spain, common law cannot enforce a donation because free contracts are excluded from the English contractual scope…

St7. The zero-hour contract is not allowed in Spain, where the law establishes the maximum of 40 working hours per week…

Moreover, although it is not integrated in the CEFR CV, connecting the topic with their own personal-professional experience, was reported as another meditation strategy originated from the journal writing task (JW1-4). This seems evident because the design of this collaborative task was motivated by personal-professional contexts whenever possible so that 31 learners could explore the discussions with some reflections regarding their profession as lawyers. Extracts from students (St5-7) are shown below:

St5. Later, the idea of being a lawyer attracted me a lot, so I decided to do my training contract in a law firm, and, after that, I knew I wanted to dedicate my career to being a lawyer specializing in civil law and representing all clients who decide to hire my services…

St6. When I started studying English it was focused on BrE, both in elementary and high school. However, over the years I have assimilated AmE…

St7. I would like to work in a civil law firm. In particular, in the area of non-contractual liability. It’s the equivalent of the law of tort, characteristic of English and American law.

# RQ2. From a pedagogical perspective, which intralinguistic mediation affordances were performed on the journal writing task?

Pedagogically, and in line with Vygotsky’s theory, the findings revealed that the journal writing was used as a linguistic-social-cultural-professional tool for engaging cognitive discussions among the ESP peers through the semiotic item of written language. The specific language was professionally contextualised by combining the communicative mediation competence with reasoning and knowledge building. The online journal writing was reported as the asynchronous CALL tool for semiotic mediation in two directions: between the individual and the community and between the teacher and the individual-community through the constructive and interactive feedback.

The results reported that due to the structural and instrumental aspects of the ESP content and the journal writing task design, the different mediation affordances of linguistic, cultural, social, pedagogical and professional were performed. First, linguistic mediation was proved with the 69 written contributions of intralinguistic discourse in ESP. As mentioned earlier, these learners became creators and intermediaries of knowledge negotiation within the same language of legal English, while using language structures, and the specialised terminology and collocations accurately (Table 2 and Figure 3). Moreover, from a pedagogical perspective, the task design together with the individual corrections in red and the examples of good practice in blue (constructive feedback) posted by the teacher/researcher guided the students’ learning process towards language and content (Figure 3). This constructive feedback addressed the content exposed by all learners with some interaction aimed at engaging with the entire group: ‘Dear St XX and everyone,’ (Vygotsky’s social and cultural theory of learning). This mediated learning process, which was occasionally discussed in class to elicit accurate ESP law expressions, was intended for professional ends using English language gains.

Accordingly, cultural, social, and professional reflective views aimed at building language learners’ proficiency as lawyers. Cultural and professional mediation was projected towards JW3 and JW4. Learners especially discussed their learning progress in English and whether they were consciously aware of using British English or American English when speaking or writing in the foreign language. Also, in JW1, JW2, JW5 and JW6 most students mediated cultural and professional comparative differences between the Spanish legal system and those of the UK and the US (See extracts by St4 & St5 & Table 2). Moreover, the formation of law cases, contextualised in Spain or in English-speaking countries, contributed to reinforcing their cognitive professional development as lawyers. Students’ intralinguistic written mediation was improved by sharing complex, extensive, specialised mediation cases that corresponded with references to the ESP contexts in JW1, 2, 5 and 6. One example is shown in Figure 4.

From a social perspective, the journal writing task was framed in a collaborative CALL approach that bridged the social and the individual spheres (Vygotsky, 1981, 1986), considering that lessons were $1 0 0 \%$ online. This allowed participants to be active learners/agents/ users of their knowledge building and develop their ZPD by accomplishing the online individual-team task. The final product of the collaborative journal writing reinforced the social domain of interactive exchanges and communicative mediation for ESP, as seen in Figure 4.

These mediation affordances were complemented by the communicative functions of reception, production, interaction, and mediation. Additionally, the results suggest that, in this collaborative CALL environment, reception was a crucial communicative activity that was intentionally anticipated and was linked with the course content. Production, therefore, was achieved by learners who demonstrated the connection to previous or additional knowledge, adapting the language and providing examples and explanations, or who reflected on the target topic while comparing it with their personal and/or profession experiences. Participants performed an active role as ESP language learners and social agents/users. This fact is entirely linked to the dialogue between

Reading your post I felt truly identified.When I was a teenager, those TV shows and legal series awakened my passion for Justicethinking that I wanted to qualify as a lawyer who will act for her clients in the name of justice.In that moment I was only a dreamy gir who fantasized about making a better and fairer world.

Trying to achieve that goal I decided to study the double degree of law with businesses.Those six years opened my eyes and taught me that law wasnt my only vocation.Now Im stil looking for the path which allows me to combine my two passions and I'm sure thatI'm taking the appropriate steps to do so.

individual-community or interaction-mediation needed in this collaborative learning task. Furthermore, interaction was frequently used by participants who engaged with previous contributions (e.g. Dear friend, I feel identified with your text the same thing happens to me too.; I feel identified with the beginning of your Journal Writing because the reason why I studied law is very similar to yours. In my case, I liked business, but I wanted to have two degrees…).

Figure 4, extracted from JW1, shows the four language activities of reception, production, interaction, and mediation (CEFR CV, 2020). It is significant to underline that the creation of this paragraph successfully mediated the four ESP concepts assigned (justice; qualify as a lawyer; act for clients; fair) to this student, or in Vygotskian terms, it proves the higher mental functions of the language through interaction, knowledge building and communicative competence.

All in all, it is important to acknowledge that a purposeful learning design was required to address the different affordances described so that students successfully targeted intralinguistic mediation. In other words, the content and the structure of the online journal writing task aimed at clear goals, social interaction, professional content, hypothetical legal situations/cases, mediation strategies, experienced learning reflections, and word limits, among other. As a student-oriented task, collaborative journal writing served the purposes of enhancing learners’ communicative skills and written mediation in professional English with the teacher’s guidance and constructive feedback.

# Discussion

This study explored intralinguistic mediation strategies through the online collaborative journal writing to enhance the co-construction of meaning in the ESP context through six JW topics. As inferred from the findings, the written contributions made satisfactory mediation progress in this ESP communicative learning environment using the same linguistic code (English to English) with the formulation of a message for a third-party (being the online learning community). It is believed that learners benefitted from mediating with the language itself to make meaningful contributions in the field of law (Vygotsky, 1981, 1986).

The results of this study support that mediation is acknowledged to be proficiently integrated into the specific journal writing task as an advanced skill to support cognitive development, social interaction, and ESP learning (Thompson, 2013; Vygotsky, 1986). As corroborated by Vygotsky (1981), mediation is a human action for ‘reflexion, self-determination and active adaptation’ (pp. 151–152). The autonomous learners of the present study followed these steps during their communicative learning process and associated their contributions with social and individual scopes, using intralinguistic communicative mediation. Accordingly, these ESP active learners/agents/users performed communicative mediation by making themselves understood while reflecting on the professionally oriented content proposed by the teacher, and while reasoning, linking, or adapting it to their situations with specific expressions. Moreover, combining the co-construction of law-related content with the learners’ (personal-professional; self-other) experiences seemed a satisfactory approach for intralinguistic mediation, knowledge building and advances in their professional field.

It was also observed that students used the ESP terminology adapting the written assignments to the professionally oriented topics planned and by comparing Spanish and especially, British and American legal systems, cases and traditions. This result gained innovative significance. Through the co-construction of meaning, learners mediated their language learning by implementing some of the mediation strategies prompted by the CEFR CV: linking to previous knowledge, adapting the language, breaking down complicated information and connecting the topic with their experiences. The results suggest that students had some opportunities to enhance their communicative mediation in the ESP context of legal English during collaborative journal writing. In line with previous research, collaborative learning is reported as a communicative social process that contributes to multimodal knowledge building thanks to contextualised professional language and learners’ reflections (García-Sánchez & Burbules, 2017; Kukulska‐Hulme & Viberg, 2018;

Peng et  al., 2017; Roschelle, 2020; Shayakhmetova, Mukharlyamova, Zhussupova, & Beisembayeva, 2020; Vygotsky, 1986).

Another mediation affordance of ESP concepts, texts and communication was the learners’ professional development through their shared experiences, reasoning, and thoughts. Since mediation is considered a common practice in lawyers who are required to explain complex legal concepts, legislative articles, and procedures to (international) clients (Chovancová, 2018), the collaborative journal writing seemed to have enhanced learners’ co-construction of professional meaning while establishing a dialogue between the self and the other (Azadi et  al., 2018; Vygotsky, 1981, 1986).

Finally, it can be inferred that the present study supports the pedagogical benefits of autonomous (individual) and collaborative (social) CALL for ESP mediation, interaction, and online communication (Portman & Broido, 2019; Teng & Zhang, 2018). As recognised by Vygotsky, the collaborative journal writing task served as a tool to engage participants in the social aspect of mediation through their ZPD with the mediation of texts, concepts, and communication. The law learners acted as social agents/users of the language itself by making specific knowledge available to the community. The information that the students mediated and presented through written artifacts, although it was linked to the ESP course syllabi, prompted further exploration. Correspondingly, using collaborative journal writing as a contextualised task helped develop students’ English language skills through meditation in different learning affordances: linguistically, culturally, socially, pedagogically, and professionally (Kessler & Bikowski, 2010; North & Piccardo, 2016). The findings also reported that online journal writing can be presented as a collaborative task that comprises the four language functions established by the CEFR CV: reception, production, interaction, and mediation. This evidence resonates well with other studies in the literature (Gimenez, 2020; Leung & Jenkins, 2020; Li, 2018; Piccardo et  al., 2019; Porto, 2019; Such, 2021).

# Conclusions and future research

This small-scale research has intended to shed some light on communicative written mediation and the co-construction of ESP knowledge in the professional field of law, considering Vygotsky’s interactive learning approach and the most recent version of the CEFR CV (2020). In this study, intralinguistic written mediation of texts, concepts, and communication contributed to specific knowledge building and expert vocabulary for the law profession in different learning affordances: linguistically, culturally, socially, pedagogically, and professionally.

The ESP educational community was contextualised in their professional legal field comparing Spanish legal cases, situations, and legislation with those based on the United Kingdom and the United States. The 69 written contributions participated in three written mediation strategies for knowledge building: linking to previous knowledge (class content or other); language adaptation and breaking down complicated information with examples and explanatory comments (CEFR CV, 2020). Because of the task design, connecting the ESP topic with learners’ own experience resulted in another mediation strategy performed by students when creating meaningful paragraphs with accurate vocabulary and specific structures.

Moreover, the online journal writing task functioned as the asynchronous CALL tool for mediated learning between the individual and the community and between the teacher and the individual-community. Collaborative journal writing was therefore described as an interactive communicative artifact/task for learners to co-construct their ESP written contributions and mediate/understand/learn the language from a professional perspective.

Conclusively, mediating ESP communication, texts, cases, or concepts also enhanced the communicative language functions of reception, production, and interaction (CEFR CV, 2020). It has been acknowledged that a more interpersonal language use that addressed the ESP students’ professional and personal experiences was relevant in the production part. When mediating texts or concepts, learners used additional or explanatory information and adapted the language to newly created scenarios needed for the online discussion. It is important to underline that intralinguistic mediation has been considered an advanced communicative language competence/strategy in this study, providing the creation of a message or the explanation of new expert knowledge among ESP learners in an autonomous and collaborative learning environment.

This research, nevertheless, has a few limitations. The receptive and productive modes of written mediation were limited to a single case study related collaborative CALL, communication, and ESP learners in the field of law. Further explorations would be necessary to extend the investigation of intralinguistic communicative mediation, both as a communicative activity and a strategy in other ESP fields, and in both written and spoken forms. Students’ perceptions on the pedagogical efficacy of the online collaborative journal writing task could also be reported with qualitative data that included their feedback to the programme.
