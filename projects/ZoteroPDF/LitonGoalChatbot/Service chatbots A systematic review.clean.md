## Abstract

Chatbots or Conversational agents are the next significant technological leap in the field of conversational services, that is, enabling a device to communicate with a user upon receiving user requests in natural language. The device uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to respond to the user with automated responses. While this is a relatively new area of study, the application of this concept has increased substantially over the last few years. The technology is no longer limited to merely emulating human conversation but is also being increasingly used to answer questions, either in academic environments or in commercial uses, such as situations requiring assistants to seek reasons for customer dissatisfaction or recommending products and services.

The primary purpose of this literature review is to identify and study the existing literature on cutting-edge technology in developing chatbots in terms of research trends, their components and techniques, datasets and domains used, as well as evaluation metrics most used between 2011 and 2020. Using the standard SLR guidelines designed by Kitchenham, this work adopts a systematic literature review approach and utilizes five prestigious scientific databases for identifying, extracting, and analyzing all relevant publications during the search. The related publications were filtered based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment to obtain the final review paper.

The results of the review indicate that the exploitation of deep learning and reinforcement learning architecture is the most used technique to understand users' requests and to generate appropriate responses. Besides, we also found that the Twitter dataset (open domain) is the most popular dataset used for evaluation, followed by Airline Travel Information Systems (ATIS) (close domain) and Ubuntu Dialog Corpora (technical support) datasets. The SLR review also indicates that the open domain provided by the Twitter dataset, airline and technical support are the most common domains for chatbots. Moreover, the metrics utilized most often for evaluating chatbot performance (in descending order of popularity) were found to be accuracy, F1-Score, BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), recall, human-evaluation, and precision.

## Introduction

In the era of rapidly evolving conversational services, chatbots (like Apple Siri and Alexa Amazon) are the next important technological advancement, allowing businesses to enable users to communicate with messaging systems with artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. Due to the increasing use of chatbots in messaging platforms, this technology is the most preferred channel for customer services. This is evident from the number of active bots on Facebook Messenger, which has been increased from 100,000 bots in 2017 to over 400,000 bots in 2020, as the number of people currently using Messenger hit 2.32 billion (Lloyd, 2020). With growing numbers of users, the company found it effective to invest in this technology to serve its customers' needs. Companies can thus increase employee productivity and encourage more people to utilize their services.

The primary purpose of chatbots is to enable computers to conduct natural language conversations with humans; from the human's perspective, these should be as human-like as possible. Therefore, making this happen has become a central challenge, with many researchers looking for the best technique to enable the chatbot to converse like a human. A successful chatbot has a capability to understand the user's message in complying with the message, retrieves the necessary information accurately and responses

The existing chatbot's key concern would be to understand user inputs and respond within the right context because chatbots still rely on input pattern matching and try to find a pre-defined response that matches the input. The drawback of this approach is that it works well in a conversation with some specific purpose but does not provide satisfactory results in open-ended conversations. Early chatbots, such as ELIZA, PARRY, and ALICE, to name a few, relied on simple parsing, keyword retrieval, or pattern matching techniques to process the input from the user utterances and generating reply by utilizing hand-crafted rules. These kinds of techniques were precise in keeping context due to their domain-specific nature. However, as the information space became more substantial and expectations of users grew, these systems fail in predicting users' intentions and are not cost-effective. This is because these hand-crafted rules require a massive amount of work to create several patterns for generating replies.

Nowadays, with the advancement of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, researchers and developers have developed chatbots with different design techniques, indirectly making them more effective than one designed by the conventional approach. Lately, with the rapid advancement of the mobile device market and evolution of messaging platforms over the past few years, along with the added user benefits of having a familiar interface, no need for downloading or installing any extra application, and 24/7 availability, chatbots are becoming an increasingly popular option and receiving heightened attention in the industry. However, despite using improved techniques, chatbots still encounter several challenges while understanding user requests, processing them, generating appropriate responses and maintaining a user conversation. As such, researchers and developers keep on improving such chatbot development techniques for finding the solution that best fits the intentions of users and service providers and is satisfactory to both. Moreover, even though chatbots have been developed for decades and the chatbot technology concept has continuously evolved, the specification for evaluating chatbot performance does not keep pace and is likely to become obsolete soon as the technology changes rapidly. Therefore, it is pertinent to establish a proper evaluation strategy for chatbot development. Considering all these facts, there is a need for more research into the current literature on state-of-the-art techniques or models to enhance chatbot development.

Hence this paper provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, the most preferred method of conducting unbiased reviews by many researchers (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007; Kitchenham et al., 2009). This approach is useful for better reviewing, summarizing, and examining the trends covered by published articles in good quality publications on chatbot development techniques, thereby providing relevant information to researchers. This SLR is performed in accordance with Kitchenham and Charters (2007) and Kitchenham et al. (2009) guidelines. In order to provide the most significant insights for researchers in this domain, SLR uses evidence-based software engineering for aggregating relevant evidence in the field of study (Kitchenham et al., 2009). As a result, this review provides the following significant contributions:

- A comprehensive systematic literature review of the existing techniques and models used in chatbot development. This SLR will help better understand emerging trends and allow researchers and practitioners in the field to come up with solutions for existing challenges.
- A quantitative analysis of the latest service chatbots is presented, including the application domains, datasets, and various metrics used to evaluate the chatbots' performance.

The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 gives the background of the study, providing an overview of the development of chatbots. Section 3 describes the applied SLR methodology, while the SLR results are outlined in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 present the limitations and conclusion of the paper, respectively.

## Overview of chatbots

Chatbots, also known as chatterbots, or dialogue/conversational systems/agents, have received extensive attention in the last few years, growing into the most preferred platform

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

## Chatbot Components and Approaches

### General Pipeline Components

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming are applied on the user request to obtain structured data, which is fed to the NLU module.

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Processes every incoming user request by incorporating different strategies. It parses the user request and tries to interpret the user's intention and associated details. Some chatbots first apply NLP techniques as pre-processing to extract structured data, which is then fed to NLU approaches for meaning extraction.

- **Dialogue Manager**: Analyzes the input request transformed into understandable structured data, keeps track of the dialogue context (semantic frame), and determines the next system action. If the semantic frame is incomplete, it can seek clarification from the user to maintain relevant context and ensure completeness without ambiguity.

- **Data Sources**: Stores and retrieves information used by the dialogue manager. Sources can be internal (AIML templates, rules structures, built databases) or external (third-party services like Web APIs).

- **Response Generator**: Provides suitable responses from candidate options after action execution. Chatbots can be classified into two models based on response generation: retrieval-based and generative-based.

### Response Generation Approaches

#### Retrieval-based Approach

Chatbots using this approach search pre-constructed conversation repositories to select responses matching user requests. Benefits include no grammatical errors due to pre-defined responses, but they have limited flexibility for domain-specific responses. The key is finding the best request-response match, with rule-based chatbots using human-made rules for selection.

#### Generative-based Approach

These models use Machine Translation techniques with Sequence-to-Sequence models, translating input to output responses through training on large datasets. Also known as Artificial Intelligence Chatbots, they:
- Are highly flexible across domains
- Learn from extensive interaction data
- Are complex and expensive
- Generate real-time responses with potential sentence formation errors
- May require domain-specific knowledge bases
- Need higher intelligence than retrieval-based approaches

### Service Chatbot Techniques

Service chatbots follow three primary phases:

1. **Pre-processing (NLP)**:
- Prepares and converts data into appropriate text input
- Uses NLP for information collection, tokenization, and parsing
- May include removing unnecessary data (images, numbers, punctuation, etc.)
- Requires careful selection of techniques as different contexts need different approaches
- Some operations like stop word removal and stemming may affect meaning and context

[McTear, Callejas, & Griol, 2016]

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

### 2.2.1.1. Embedding

After pre-processing steps, the text data needs to be turned into a numerical form for a computer to understand the meaning of words or phrases. This concept is called embedding (encoding or vectorizing). There are several types of embedding, such as character embedding, word embedding, and sentence embedding, to name a few. Among these embedding types, the word embedding is mainly used.

Word embedding is a language-modeling technique employed to map words to real number vectors. In vector space, it represents words or phrases with multiple dimensions. The primary models of vector representation produce sparseness matrices that generate enormous amounts of data as the input data grows, such as Bag of words and Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Recently, current neural networks model exist for word embeddings such as word2vec, FastTex, and Glove. All of these models attempt to maximize conditional probability words for better prediction between similar words.

### 2.2.2. Processing (NLU)

The processing step is related to the natural language (NLU) component used to gather and handle conversations based on user-input data that have gone through the pre-processing step. To function properly, the designated model must consider the interactions between the models and users by building a representation semantics of the user's request. In the context of a request that has been previously transformed into plain text, the module will attempt to extract primary information that has been the user's intention (intent detection). Indeed, to better represent the information collected from the request, it is necessary to extract entities (slot filling) (i.e. price, names, company, etc.) that will be arguments or constraints of the identified intent. In addition, some researchers recently combined these two tasks (detecting the user's intent and labeling the slots) as joint models to predict user utterances better.

### 2.2.2.1. Intent detection

One of the most-used components in NLU is detecting intent (Tran & Luong, 2020; Zhao et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Khurana et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2016; Anantaram & Sangroya, 2017; Balodis & Deksne, 2019; Shin & Cha, 2019; Rychalska, Glabska, & Wroblewska, 2018). Intent detection is primarily concerned with matching the user's request to the most likely target. Therefore, it mainly involves classification; as the key role of the dialogue system or service chatbot is to answer questions within a limited context, there are a fixed number of pre-defined attempts available.

Earlier, the most widely used method was template-based to understand the natural language with keyword-matching techniques, as mentioned in a study by Yu, Black, and Rudnicky (2017). However, this method is somewhat restricted and requires labour-intensive efforts to generate a large number of hand-crafted rules. Hence, classifiers that learn from labeled examples are more effectiveness done by Liu et al. (2016). In his study, he has classified queries based on two different domains by implementing a support vector machine (SVM) technique as intent models. In the first type of intent model, used primarily in the communication domain, queries are classified into intents such as send a text message, make phone calls, and send emails. The other type of intent model, used in the device-control domain, manages the device functionality and involves such operations as an open app, open setting, change the setting, and check WiFi. To further enhance the intent model in these domains, he attempts to add the personalization features derives from the user's profile for the SVM classifier.

Notably, the new chatbots exploit neural network classifiers to detect intent with several techniques such as Shallow feedforward network (Balodis & Deksne, 2019), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (Anantaram & Sangroya, 2017), Long Short-Term Memory (

## Natural Language Understanding and Generation in Chatbots

## Language Understanding Components

### Entity Extraction
Character embedding fed through a biLSTM network enables entity extraction. The biLSTM captures entity patterns while character-generated word embeddings improve the model by extracting context from out-of-vocabulary words, enhancing entity extraction performance.

### Joint Intent Identification and Slot Filling
Most studies conducted language understanding in a pipeline manner, detecting user intent before labeling slots. This approach allows errors to propagate through the pipeline. To address this, researchers developed joint models that handle intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF) concurrently.

Firdaus, Kumar, Ekbal, and Bhattacharyya (2019) proposed an end-to-end hierarchical multi-task model using encoder-decoder architecture. The model extracts data through CNN and RNNs working hierarchically with biLSTM and biGRU. It employs a CRF classifier instead of Softmax at the output layer, improving slot filling accuracy by capturing label dependency.

A limitation of joint models is their tendency to perform well on only one task due to trade-off parameters between ID and SF loss functions. Xu et al. (2020) addressed this by combining both tasks into single sequence-labeling using an attention-based encoder-decoder with a new tag scheme.

## Response Generation (NLG)

Natural language generation (NLG) determines system responses based on available information. The component converts structured data into human-understandable language. Response generation approaches include:

### Rule-based Approach
Early chatbots used rule-based approaches. Augello et al. (2012) developed a domain-oriented Question-Answering system with three modules:
- Pre-processing of user sentences
- Ontology-based knowledge base expansion
- Complex response generation through inferencing

Chakrabarti and Luger (2012) designed conversational agents using:
- Knowledge engine for conversation content organization
- Conversation engine for semantic context management
- Grice's maxims as language model
- Probabilistic Finite State Automata for conversation control

### Retrieval-based Approach
Service chatbots can process varied user queries through data-oriented methods. They retrieve responses from pre-defined datasets. Recent studies enhance response selection through:
- DocChat method for unstructured documents (Yan et al., 2018)
- External knowledge integration (Yang et al., 2018)
- Topic information incorporation (Wu et al., 2018)
- Personalization features (Liu et al., 2018)

### Generative-based Approach
This approach uses sequence-to-sequence learning with encoder-decoder architecture. Common implementations use:
- LSTM/biLSTM (Aleedy et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019)
- GRU/biGRU (Aleedy et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2019)
- Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (HRED) (Peng et al., 2020)

Moreover, several studies test the functionality of end-to-end approaches by utilizing the seq2seq learning task model in task-oriented chatbots. The end-to-end strategies attempt to train dialogue systems without requiring each component to be specified. The training process is typically defined as generating a responding utterance based on dialogue history (context) and ontology. However, conversational task-oriented chatbots depend on slot-filling architecture makes it inherently challenging to expand such structures to new domains because state representation and action space must be hand-crafted (Bordes, Boureau, & Weston, 2017). To address this issue, Bordes et al. (2017) propose a set of synthetic tasks to test the viability of end-to-end models in a task-oriented environment, using a memory network to model conversation. These approaches learn from data in a supervised fashion based on the dialogue policy. A study by Shin and Cha (2019) also adopted an end-to-end structure by enhancing it to a new artificial neural network structure and recurrent cell. This structure was used in a restaurant setting, whereby it accurately modeled previously stated user preferences that appeared in the dialogue and gave appropriate responses. They use Task Dependent Recurrent Entity Network (TDREN) model with a new recurrent cell based on GRU in their work. The cells attempt to measure the degree of similarity between the input utterance and the keyword at the entity extractor (slot filling).

Patidar, Agarwal, Vig, and Shroff (2018) use the attention-based Seq2Seq model to assign labeled data to hierarchical categories. In cases when the response predictions were not consistent, a slot-filling method was utilized to determine which questions needed to be asked for accurate predictions. Ham, Lim, Lee, and Kim (2019) attempt to extend the Hybrid Code Network (HCN) version to minimize human effort while integrating external knowledge base with domain knowledge. This extended version of the HCN is more flexible and adaptable to change in the knowledge base, as it incorporates trainable neural networks to allow learning from data - these are Application Programming Interface (API) slot-value tracker and API result selector improve accuracy when measured against the ordinary HCN.

Chou and Hsueh (2019) bypass difficult and time-consuming development processes in task-oriented chatbots. First, they proposed a sentence generation model using RNN and LSTM models for generating sentences. Then, to improve the sentences produced, they combine the reinforcement learning and the generative adversarial networks (GAN) techniques. Hori et al. (2019) use a similar approach to Chou and Hsueh (2019). However, the difference between the studies is the technique used in generated response (decoder structure). Hori et al. (2019) optimizes the decoder structure by adding and combining the minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding technique and example-based response selection. They undertake to enhance objective evaluation metrics and human rating evaluation in developing better chatbots.

Apart from using only single response generation approaches, some works attempt to hybridize the retrieval or rule-based methods with the generative-based method. For example, Yang et al. (2019) introduce a hybrid neural conversation model that comprises a generation module, a retrieval module, and a hybrid ranking module. A significant drop in feature engineering overheads can be achieved using neural ranking models capable of learning representations and matching features about the context and response of generated dialogue candidates. Furthermore, a distant supervision approach has been proposed to create the training data required for the neural ranking function. In this method, the generated or retrieved response labels are automatically deduced by the system. Similarly, Bartl and Spanakis (2017) divided the proposed model into three distinct ways. First, they encode raw conversations in embeddings with the actual meaning by utilizing the HRED. Then, they integrate a retrieval-based method based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing

It can be observed that the studies in chatbots were proliferating from 2016 and became a hot area in the last two years, which shows that the latest and most significant studies are included in this review. It is clearly apparent that this is due to the explosion of messaging apps and technological advancement in 2016, which brought awareness to researchers about harnessing this technology.

## Summary of techniques used in designing service chatbot development

This section focuses on the RQ2 that identifies the techniques or models of service chatbots based on basic common workflow, as described in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2. Table 4 presents the three-phase architectural process and several components, techniques, or models used for each procedure applied to service chatbots from the studies considered for this SLR. We also present a brief explanation and the main advantages for each component and techniques used in the table. However, most of the selected articles for this SLR focus more on processing (NLU) and generation (NLG) processes as chatbots can directly use the NLU component and skip the pre-processing of user messages by feeding the message directly to the NLU module. As such, pre-processing steps are discussed to understand its functionality while developing a service chatbot.

As indicated in Table 4, we identified that the most used embedding is neural network character-based and word-based embedding methods such as word2vec, Glove, and FastText. Such word embedding techniques attempt to minimize vector space's dimensionality, dense vector representation and extract the relationship between words. For example, vectors that are close to each other represent words that are close to each other. In addition, character embeddings are well-known for their performance on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) and uncommon words. In contrast to word embeddings, which handle words atomically, character embeddings generate a vector for a word from its constituent characters. While word embedding models lack sufficient training data for unusual words, character embedding models can learn accurate word embeddings using the characters in words. Thus, incorporating both embedding techniques can learn better features of the input model. However, these methods are successful only when there is sufficient data, as they optimize conditional probability between similar words by using neural networks. In this case, cutting-edge deep learning methods cannot be used as there is insufficient training data, owing to the specific nature of the subject area of the system. Perevalov et al. (2019) proposed using the Shannon entropy method for question embeddings to address this problem. In applying this method as a solution, developers calculated the information rate: the amount of information contained in a word under consideration. They further developed a simple method to convert the word to its dense vector representation that did not require much data; this method worked well compared to classical and modern methods when there is a small and specific dataset. Therefore, the final solution entailed representing a word by its entropy distribution in the context of questions mentioned in the given dataset – using the approach of question embeddings based on Shannon entropy calculation.

Moreover, almost all studies are inclined to use deep neural networks such as RNN, LSTM CNN, and biLSTM to identify intent and entity extraction in the NLU module

## Expert Systems Applications

adding slot-filling tasks and a back-end knowledge base for classifying question type and intent and actively queries the user for missing information using a dialogue framework. Khurana et al. (2017) created a solution whereby frequently asked questions were grouped in an equivalence class of questions often asked and had a definite answer. They attempt to combine biLSTM-based Siamese and classification models with iterative training procedures (HSCM-IT). The Siamese network model takes pairs of input sequences (queries) and classifies them as similar and dissimilar semantically by leveraging the biLSTM model. In another study, Khurana et al. (2018) combine biLSTM layers and max pool layers arranged hierarchically. The first arrangement represents each user's utterances, and the second arrangement is to generate representatives for a sequence of utterances. This representative is used to identify the intention of users.

Most studies implement hybrid methods to learn feature representation for entity extraction better. For example, Tran and Luong (2020) adopted CRF (conditional random fields) as a sequence labeling in their work. CRFs are commonly used and produce cutting-edge results in many NLP problems. However, CRFs require a good feature set to construct a robust model. As such, the author uses and compares the

Neural models of biLSTM and CNN at both character and word-based embedding are used to learn features for CRF automatically. Although Liu et al. (2016) implemented the CRF technique for context extractors, it cannot be performed automatically to learn features as different methods are used for identifying intent. Zaity et al. combine CNN with RNNs (GRU and LSTM) to extract the relevant entity from the text. The authors formulate learning architecture as a hierarchy of spatial CNN features followed by the RNNs to model dependencies in the temporal domain.

Furthermore, from different types of response generation approaches as presented in Section 2.2.3, most studies employed deep neural networks and seq-to-seq learning based on an encoder-decoder architecture with varying enhancement techniques, as indicated in Table 4. In addition to response generation approaches, the seq2seq model is also implemented in other components such as multi-intent (Rychalska et al., 2018), joining model of intent and slot filling (Firdaus et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019), and task-oriented chatbot (Bordes et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Shin & Cha, 2019; Patidar et al., 2018; Chou & Hsueh, 2019; Hori et al., 2019).

Considering this fact, the seq2seq model is becoming a promising technique in developing service chatbots. However, the limitation of this approach tends to produce generic, meaningless and inconsistent responses. Therefore, as presented in Table 4, several enhancements of the seq2seq learning task model have been proposed. These enhancements can be categorized into:

- Deep reinforcement learning (Cuayáhuitl et al., 2019; Chou & Hsueh, 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020)
- Attention-based (Yang et al., 2019; Zhang, Lan, Guo, Xu, & Cheng, 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019; Hori et al., 2019)
- Adversarial learning (Chou & Hsueh, 2019; Olabiyi, Khazane, & Mueller, 2019)
- Adding extra features such as emotion (Peng et al., 2020)
- Topic information (Ren et al., 2019)
- Adding persona or user information (Yang et al., 2019; Olabiyi et al., 2019)
- Modification of deep learning algorithm such as adding additional gate into the gating mechanism (Wen & Young, 2020; Tran & Nguyen, 2019)
- Adding multiple encoder structure to fit difference topic information (Ren et al., 2019)
- Optimizing an objective function to adapt different conversation scenario (Zhang et al., 2018)

However, these enhancement techniques are not restricted to a single adaptation. They could be mixed with other suitable techniques as presented in Table 4 to obtain better response generation; for example, reinforcement learning can be joined with emotion or attention-based models. Such work of enhancement by Tran and Nguyen (2019) and Wen and Young (2020) integrate and jointly optimize sentence planning and surface realization into a single recurrent structure. Tran and Nguyen, 2019 leverage a combination of gating and attention mechanisms. Three semantic cells are added into a traditional RNNs-GRU model, namely: a Refinement, Adjustment, and an Output cell, to select, control, and produce appropriate sentences. The difference between

Generate an appropriate response. For example, Xu et al. (2019), Firdaus et al. (2019), Bashir et al. (2018), Balodis and Deksne (2019), Liu et al. (2016) and Chen, Hakkani-Tür, and He (2016) implemented this metric to assess the performance of the intent classifier and slot tagger in their research work. Peng et al. (2020) also used this metric which measures the emotional controllability in the generated response in their work, wherein the emotions of the generated responses were compared against the emotions of real responses in a dataset to compute the accuracy. However, this metric does not work well when a severe class imbalance exists.

As opposed to this, Perevalov et al. (2019) adopted F1-score in place of accuracy to evaluate a linear classifier such as logistic regression due to an imbalance in classes datasets. F1-score (also F-score or F-measure) is another evaluation metric used to evaluate the performance of a machine-learning model (or classifier). It indicates the balance between the precision and the recall of the classifier. A high F1-score indicates a high value for both precision and recall. For example, in studies by Xu et al. (2019), Firdaus et al. (2019) and Rychalska et al. (2018) to name a few, this metric was used to evaluate the performance of the different types of slots in datasets. Precision and recall are mathematical methods of automatic text summary assessment; these two metrics primarily deal with the extraction of context and data that is relevant to the human-computer exchange. Precision is a percentage measure of the number of times the data provided in a dialogue is consistent with the issue being discussed. On the other hand, recall refers to the percentage measure of the number of replies that the bot can classify into the relevant topics on the basis of human-computer dialogue. In some instances, precision and recall are vital in performing an automatic assessment of BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation).

## Evaluation Metrics for Chatbots

Aleedy et al. (2019) used BLEU as an evaluation metric to calculate the degree of likeness between the generated response and the actual reply as it is known to better correlate with human views, including generation of replies during exchanges, as compared to sentence-level BLEU (Yang et al., 2019). BLEU is a tool derived from the precision tool and to automatically test machine translation efficiency in comparison with human translation. BLEU evaluates the response or output based on the n-gam guideline where a BLEU score is between 0 and 1. A perfect score for the match is 1.0, and a perfect score for the mismatch is 0.0.

On the contrary, a study by Ren et al. (2019) does not use BLEU as an evaluation metric for assessing the performance of chatbots since there is a poor correlation between BLEU and human judgement. Considering this, they adopted perplexity as an evaluation metric in their study. Perplexity is another evaluation metric used to measure how accurately a designated model is able to predict a response. It is defined as the exponent of the average negative log-likelihood per word. A lower perplexity score indicates a better generation performance.

Human evaluation is another metric used to evaluate the performance of chatbots. When compared to human assessment, automatic evaluation has fewer overheads and is more time-efficient, but it fails in analyzing whether the generated reply is helpful, appropriate, and natural. A common method of human evaluation to assess user satisfaction is letting users communicate with the intended chatbot and measure their satisfaction using a Likert scale. Before rating, researchers may also request ratings from users on particular characteristics such as adequacy, informativeness, naturalness (Hori et al., 2019), fluency (Zhang et al., 2018; Cuayáhuitl et al., 2019), engagingness, consistency (Cuayáhuitl et al., 2019), among others. Moreover, Yang et al. (2019) used case studies with examples of responses; such examples are also needed to assess the consistency of the response fully.

## 5. Limitations

The aim of this SLR is to review and examine the primary studies on service chatbots. The study's validity may have been affected by multiple factors. However, there are a few drawbacks to be aware of:

- One significant drawback of this study is in relation to the process of data extraction. Though the data collected is rationally satisfactory, it is focused on the context of certain research questions. Therefore, there are a certain chance specifics not addressed in this analysis would be found by readers of this study; we, in fact, hope these will make a significant contribution towards better identifying research trends.

- Even though five bibliographic databases were considered for the retrieval of the relevant studies (as defined in Section 3), they are not thorough and, as such, may have limited the efficacy of this research.

## 6. Discussion

This section discusses the findings based on analysing the results found from the articles selected in this SLR. The findings are based on the literature from the past decade and demonstrate the different approaches, evaluation and dataset supported in designing the service chatbots. In responding to the stated research questions, which aims to identify the techniques or models of service chatbots concerning NLP, NLU, and NLG modules, it can be concluded that most of the used techniques incorporate deep learning and reinforcement learning to design a service chatbot. Consequentially, this conclusion corresponds to the finding from Section 4.1. Generally, the service chatbot is designed based on its general architecture, as mentioned in Section 2.1, which consists of several components that are gone through a pipeline or modular-based.

Oftentimes, developing a pipeline system requires large amounts of labeled dialogue data to train each component. The modular structure usually used in task-oriented or retrieval-based approaches makes the system easier to interpret and stable than its end-to-end (generative-based) counterparts. As a result, this approach becomes a more viable option in real-world businesses. However, it can be inferred the researchers recently attempted to adopt the end-to-end approach using the seq2seq learning task model based on encoder-decoder architecture. This model imitated from the neural machine translation task almost for other approaches. Such a result may be due to the end-to-end approach requiring minimal annotation to time-saving and cost-effective making it another attractive option for business applications.

Besides, each component in the pipeline system is optimized separately, and the performance of each element in a modularization approach does not represent a whole system. However, the end-to-end structure makes it more uncontrollable, leading to produce generic, meaningless and inconsistent responses. This may happen due to the nature of this dialogue system handled in an end-to-end style without emphasising individual modules. Therefore, researchers have proposed several enhancements of the seq2seq learning task model based on the selected article for this SLR. These enhancements can be incorporating the appropriate embedding techniques into representing the data. In addition, the most preferred embedding techniques are using character-based embedding and word embedding methods such as word2vec, Glove and FastText. These methods can learn word vector efficiently and perform well for out of vocabulary (OOV) words. Thus, infrequent words character embedding models can still learn proper embeddings of words with the help of characters in words.
