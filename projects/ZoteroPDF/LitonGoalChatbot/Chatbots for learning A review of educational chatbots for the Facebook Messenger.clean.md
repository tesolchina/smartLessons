## Abstract

With the exponential growth in the mobile device market over the last decade, chatbots are becoming an increasingly popular option to interact with users, and their popularity and adoption are rapidly spreading. These mobile devices change the way we communicate and allow ever-present learning in various environments. This study examined educational chatbots for Facebook Messenger to support learning. The independent web directory was screened to assess chatbots for this study resulting in the identification of 89 unique chatbots. Each chatbot was classified by language, subject matter and developer's platform. Finally, we evaluated 47 educational chatbots using the Facebook Messenger platform based on the analytic hierarchy process against the quality attributes of teaching, humanity, affect, and accessibility. We found that educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform vary from the basic level of sending personalized messages to recommending learning content. Results show that chatbots which are part of the instant messaging application are still in its early stages to become artificial intelligence teaching assistants. The findings provide tips for teachers to integrate chatbots into classroom practice and advice what types of chatbots they can try out.

## 1. Introduction

A chatbot is a software tool that interacts with users on a certain topic or in a specific domain in a natural, conversational way using text and voice. For many different purposes, chatbots have been used across a wide range of domains, including marketing, customer service, technical support, as well as education and training. Current developments in this area suggest that interaction with technologies, either by natural language or by speech, is possible because technology develops, and users become more used to interacting with digital entities. Rather than creating a human-like smart machine application, it is about creating effective digital assistants who are able to provide information, answer questions, discuss a specific topic, or perform a task.

Personal digital assistants like Siri from Apple, Alexa from Amazon, Microsoft's Cortana or Assistant from Google are at the forefront of technology of voice recognition and artificial intelligence. These digital assistants use machine-learning techniques and are able to manage some day-to-day tasks of traditional assistants or secretaries (such as email prioritization, highlighting the most important content and interactions) to help their users become more effective. A vast number of simpler and more domain-specific text-based chatbots complement target-specific functionalities such as raising support tickets to leave feedback, disseminating content for publishing sites, booking a hotel room, making a restaurant reservation, etc. Text-based chatbots typically follow a set of established rules or flows to respond to questions posted by a user. These rules or flows enable them to respond effectively to requests within a specific domain, but are not efficient in answering questions, the pattern of which does not match the rules on which the chatbot is trained.

## Chatbot Types and Platforms

- Desktop (example: Braina Virtual Assistant)
- Mobile (examples: applications Andy English, DoNotPay or Replika: My AI Friend)
- Web-based service
  - Integrated on the web (examples: popup window with customer service help)
  - Individual (examples: Mitsuku, Cleverbot)
- Integrated
  - Instant messaging apps (examples: Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, Skype)
  - Communication and collaboration platform (examples: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex Teams)

Social media and networking service Facebook opened up its Messenger platform to let chatbots into the application in April 2016. Since then, the Facebook Messenger platform has over 1.3 billion monthly users (Constine, 2018), accounts with over 300,000 chatbots, as well as businesses and customers that exchange 8 billion messages a day (Johnson, 2018). The major advantage of using a Facebook Messenger chatbot is a low barrier to entry for the creator and his target audience. Facebook Messenger is the third most-used mobile application in the world, used by 68 percent of users (Hartmans, 2017).

Benefits for the users are using a familiar interface, no need to download and install extra application, 24/7 availability. Drawback includes interference from other conversations in the instant messaging application (Pereira & Díaz, 2018). There are several advantages for the chatbot creator: using the existing infrastructure of social platform, personalization of the conversation, presence on mobile and web. Chatbots can be developed in any programming language or use a third-party no-code platform that uses a visual development environment. Issues with chatbots are that users are not familiar with a chatbot experience, poor mechanisms for discoverability and limitations based on policy and usage guidelines.

The purpose of this study was to explore the use of a chatbot in the instant messaging tool to support learning. The two following research questions were addressed in this study:

Research Question 1: What is the distribution of subject matter, use of language and development environment in chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform?

Research Question 2: What is the quality of educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform?

## Methods

### Search Strategy

Compared with applications stores like Apple's App Store, Microsoft Store or Google Play there is no single space where users can filter or discover educational chatbots. If we want to find a chatbot directly on the Facebook Messenger, we need to search the name of the brand or chatbot in the search bar. However, users would rather look for a specific service than the exact name or brand. There are independent web directories like Chatbottle (chatbottle.co) or Botlist (botlist.co) that find bots. Botlist directories list chatbots from various platforms (e.g. Amazon Echo, Skype, Slack, and others), with over 2000 Messenger chatbots in 29 categories.

Screening and assessment of chatbots for study inclusion were guided by a systematic review process and restricted to the Botlist directory. The directory was inventoried during the period of March–April 2018, resulting in the identification of 121 total chatbots (N = 121). Chatbots meeting the following inclusion criteria were analyzed further: (a) education category, (b) available to the public, (c) chatbot for Facebook Messenger. However, 32 bots were found inactive or not available, resulting in 89 unique chatbots (N = 89).

### Coding of Chatbots

A coding instrument was developed to identify chatbots in the following categories: language, subject matter, and platform. Each chatbot was first classified by Language, in which the bot communicated with the user. The majority of the chatbots used English as a communication language (89%). Other languages included French (N = 8, 9%)

## Evaluating and Comparing Educational Chatbots

## Quality Assessment Methods

Computers expect chatbots to handle questions and process orders while automating routine, repetitive communications. Interactions via Facebook Messenger tend to feel more natural than mobile apps or websites, with users simply asking questions and expecting answers. However, Weinberg reports that 70% of Facebook's chatbot interactions failed, requiring human intervention when AI couldn't understand users.

Radziwill and Benton proposed a quality assessment method for chatbots and intelligent conversational agents using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This approach helps solve multicriteria decision-making problems. Their framework evaluates quality attributes including:

- Effectiveness (functionality, humanity)
- Efficiency (performance)
- Satisfaction (accessibility, affect, behavior and ethics)

## Quality Attributes for Assessment

For this study, four main categories were considered using AHP:

1. Teaching
2. Humanity
3. Affect
4. Accessibility

### Quality Attributes Table

| Category | Quality Attribute | Examples |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Teaching | Recommends learning content | Links to web pages or documents with learning topics |
| | Provides feedback, Q&A | Quizzes and tests provide instant feedback on each question |
| | Set goals and monitor learning progress | Quizzes count scores; ability to resume tests |
| Humanity | Able to maintain themed discussion | Interprets commands accurately; natural conversation |
| | Able to respond to specific questions | Flexible interpretation of knowledge |
| Affect | Provides greetings, pleasant personality | Says Hello; greets human by name |
| | Entertaining, engaging | Uses jokes, humor, emoji, animated GIFs |
| Accessibility | Can detect meaning and intent | Responds appropriately to language/clarity requests |
| | Responds to social cues appropriately | Reads and responds to human participant moods |

## Results

The AHP method decomposes unstructured situations into simpler components, assigning values based on subjective pairwise comparisons. The study evaluated 47 chatbots using scripted questions adapted during conversations based on the chatbot's dialogue style. Each chatbot was rated on a 1-100 scale across all quality attributes.

## Analytic Hierarchy Process for Chatbot Evaluation

The relative importance between criteria is measured according to a numerical scale. If one criterion is more important than the second, we assign it a value sij ∈ {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}; otherwise sij = 1/sji.

By this mutual comparison, we constructed the matrix of pairwise comparisons. Table 5 shows the final comparison matrix for criteria where each cell indicates how much more important the criteria is in the row compared to the criteria in the column. For example, the comparison between Humanity and Teaching – Teaching is preferred strongly (5 times) over Humanity, so the value 5 is entered in position (1, 2) and the reciprocal value 1/5 is automatically entered in the transpose position (2, 1).

From the matrix, we determine the principal eigenvalue, eigenvector and by its normalization we get the required weights (the scale of priorities). The computed priority vectors represent the relative weights among the criteria compared. Teaching is 57%, Humanity is 23%, Affect is 15%, and Accessibility only 5% for educational chatbots. The criterion Teaching is the most important for our study. Teaching is 2.48 times more important than Humanity (3.8 times more important than Affect and 11.4 times more than Accessibility).

The same procedure was applied for all subcriteria. Based on the calculated weights, we get an overall evaluation and ranking of the variants according to defined priorities.

Having analyzed 47 chatbots using human-chatbot conversations, we concluded that the model was too complicated and not appropriate for the relevant decision. Therefore, we modified the model by selecting 10 chatbots which obtained the highest scores from all 47. The model for the final analysis is shown in Fig. 3.

According to the final evaluation, the AskFrank variant with the total weight of 14.9 was the best placed, representing an optimal decision based on the model.

The influence of each criterion on the top ten chatbots is shown in Fig. 4. The criterion of Humanity was very important for users of the top two chatbots (AskFrank and IFRSRookies). The Wordsworth and EnglishWithEdwin chatbots were better suited to users who mainly required teaching properties (setting goals, monitoring the learning process, feedback, etc.). Only two of the top ten chatbots (AskFrank and IFRSRookies) were primarily focused on the criterion of Humanity (able to respond to specific questions, able to maintain themed discussion).

The consistency ratio value is close to 10%, meaning our chatbot preference evaluation should be consistent and acceptable. Better consistency could be achieved by deleting the Accessibility property or reassessing subjective judgment.

The AHP package in R Statistical Software was used to define and evaluate the model. This application's advantage is the easy modification of criteria values, enabling solution behavior analysis through repeated simulations.

This research was the first to review educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform and examines them based on the subject matter, conversation language and development platform. The findings from our research show that the majority of the chatbots (89%) used English as a communication language. Results also showed, nearly half of chatbots (46%) were lacking any discussion techniques or simulation of human conversation and used button-based browsing or automated answers with additional information on websites outside the chatbot interface. Based on subject matter analysis, chatbots mostly deal with learning languages, economic topics or multiple subject matter. From the developer's point-of-view, the Chatfuel service was identified as the most common platform (40%) used between building tools.

Unfortunately, over (N = 23, 26%) of these chatbots give the impression of being short-lived – they were no longer available by the end of our study. Therefore, it remains difficult for teachers to provide guidance in terms of specific chatbots a student might consider an experiment with. However, findings of this content analysis do at least provide a general idea of the types of chatbots a student or teacher might take into account.

With the exponential growth of chatbots, we can ask how intelligent chatbots are? According to the report (Weinberg, 2017), 70% of Facebook Messenger chatbots were failing to fulfil user requests. Therefore, rather than building a large chatbots ecosystem, Facebook started to train Messenger chatbots to deal with a narrower set of cases so users would not be disappointed by the automation limitations. Next step for chatbots was recent progress in natural language processing and machine learning. They are constantly learning and improving from conversations with users and do generate responses based on collections of known conversations saved in databases.

This is perhaps an appropriate occasion to raise the question, if chatbots are built to process a large amount of data, why not use them as teaching assistants? In 2016, Professor Ashok K. Goel developed chatbot called Jill Watson for students enrolled in a Georgia Institute of Technology's Master program (Eicher, Polepeddi, & Goel, 2018). This virtual teaching assistant is based on IBM's Watson and is able to answer routine, frequently asked questions on the class discussion forum.

Lars Satow (Satow, 2017) developed a model for the future, which describes the levels of learning facilitation by artificial intelligence teaching assistants:

- Level 1: Personalized messages from the teaching assistant welcomes new learners.
- Level 2: Teaching assistant advises learning materials, suggests following steps, possible collaborators and professionals for cooperative learning.
- Level 3: Teaching assistant responses to usual questions posted by students.
- Level 4: Teaching assistant establishes the steps to meet learning objectives and supervises the improvement of learning.
- Level 5: Teaching assistant gives personalized comments.
- Level 6: Teaching assistant offers individualized comments and endorsements, analyzes individual learning requests and provides tutoring instructions.

In this study, we analyzed 47 educational chatbots using the Facebook Messenger platform against the quality attributes of teaching, humanity, affect and accessibility and listed the top 10 educational chatbots.

With the exception of two (Ask Frank, IFRSRookies), most chatbots are mechanic in their behavior and answers, they lack basic interaction and communication patterns, their responses are based on button-based navigation, and they miss the skills of text-based command recognition. There was no significant difference in accessibility between educational chatbots and reactions were generally limited.

## Computers & Education Study on Educational Chatbots

## Chatbot Capabilities and Features

Only Ask Frank was able to respond to simple questions, such as "How are you?", "Can we chat?" or "What is your name?". 

Conversational style, tone, and attitude of the chatbot — the personality is critical to the success of natural dialogue between human and computer. Due to data provided by Facebook developers can easily personalize the greeting text using the person's name. We found that (N = 23, 49%) of educational chatbots were able to greet the user with a person's name. The Facebook Messenger platforms also support rich media, like images, animated GIFs and videos. These dynamic elements go a long way towards imbuing chatbots with personality. They make the conversation more enjoyable, more immersive, and more visually engaging. Emojis are another way to add personality in an entertaining and evocative way.

Based on the Lars Satow's model of learning facilitation, educational chatbots on Facebook Messenger platform vary between Level 1 and Level 4. Personalized welcome messages are simple to implement. Learning content is part of the chatbot knowledgebase, could be obtained from the web sources (e.g. a computational knowledge engine like Wolfram Alpha for Ask Frank), as well as providing links to websites. Chatbots are using pattern matching to classify text and produce a response. To be able to answer typical questions asked by learners, the intelligence of a chatbot depends on how these predefined patterns are defined and how well the text is analyzed and processed. Another way is to use a generative model with support of a neural network. This self-learning chatbot is trained using a large number of previous conversations with the users. It is always ready to have a response but this could be random and not always make sense.

Implementing a Question & Answer system to a chatbot looks like a default setting, but it requires a critical amount of data and expertise to create a conversational flow. Findings demonstrated, however, that all of the top ten educational chatbots were using quizzes or a Question & Answer module, which can help during the learning process for users. Gamification is a great way to engage students. Supporting this, results showed a game element, like a point system, was applied in four chatbots (Feed.Mind, Kuni, NELA, Mastermind Games Bot) out of the top ten. A broadcast functionality in a chatbot is able to send users reminders and keep them engaged with the chatbot. Users of the Wordsworth chatbot can sign up for a daily lesson or take a fun quiz to test their vocabulary skills.

## Limitations

The present research was bound by several limitations, pointing out the directions for future improvement. For chatbot developers and even users, discoverability is one of the biggest challenges. There is no single place where can we find chatbots on Facebook Messenger. One limitation was that chatbots for our research were selected from the bot-listed website (Botlist.com) using the Messenger and Education category as a filter. It is important to bear in mind that the scope of this research simulates possible user's searching strategy. These chatbots are promoting themselves as educational, no matter what is the actual content. Therefore, they come into sight of users using common search terms. Furthermore, the findings of this research provide insights for the limited view of publicly accessible and user-marketed educational chatbots from a time period of March–April 2018. We may obtain different results of the equivalent study when repeated at a different time.

## Conclusions

The study examined the educational chatbots in the instant messaging application Facebook Messenger with focus to identify discoverability and characteristics as language, subject matter and developer's platform. The study also focused on the evaluation of selected chatbots to describe their current stage of learning facilitation using artificial intelligence. Educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform vary from the basic level of sending personalized messages, to recommending learning content. These findings provide further evidence to suggest that chatbot programming (especially on the
