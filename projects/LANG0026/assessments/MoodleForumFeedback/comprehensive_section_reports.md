Here's my unedited video transcript: 
 
Hello everyone. I'm Cao Wen Yan, and you can call me Yanny. So I would like to use three words to describe myself. First one is introverts and introverts person and outgoing and innovative. So as you see, I'm an introvert and extrovert person at the same time, because if you first meet me and I'm trying to talk to you, but after you get well known about me, I'm pretty sure that I welcome you to chat with me, or I like to chat with teachers in my free time. So yeah, and I always like to express my emotions and stories through creative arts, yeah, through making artworks. So because my older sister is a teacher who always teach Sen students, which means that I always observed and find out that if we are adults or people who gain more abilities, we should have responsibility, that we should guide or help younger children, which means we should nurture next generations with mature cooperations. Yeah, so. And also, I think, as a innovative person, we should promote more like diverse and creative solutions that which can dealing with some social problems, and I think we also carry out duties that we should maintain the rules and also contribute to society. Thank.

**Student's Transcript:**

> Raw Transcript    Here's my unedited video transcript:    Hi everyone my name is Cheng Chui Ling and you can call me Aimee.    If I need to use three words to introduce myself,i will definitely choose curious，compassionate and good lisener.    First,I think I am curious because I like to explore new things and think about "why" about everything. This kind of questioning has prompted me to change from passively accepting the teacher's teaching to actively looking for information.    Second, I think I am very compassionate because I can always put myself in other people's shoes and take the initiative to understand their situations. For example, I can empathise with the loneliness of elderly&nbsp;&nbsp;living alone, so I participate in some volunteer activities and stay with elderly people living alone at home.    Third, I think I am a good listener because I never rush to criticize or comment, nor do I interrupt others impatiently. Instead, I listen to what others say patiently before giving some suggestions. This also allows me to be very comfortable in teamwork and listen to and understand the opinions of different team members.    Then, my background influence my view of global citizenship is that there are foreign teachers in my primary school.I think they are friendly and are my first window to the world. Through them, I realized that I am not the only one living in the world. There are many people from different countries, cultures, and languages on the earth, and we live together on the earth. It made me realize that we are all part of a global society. Being a global citizen means taking on the responsibilities of a citizen, focusing on major global issues like global warming and the Sustainable Development Goals rather than just focusing on my own concerns. And I want to actually do things well, not just pay lip service to them. Thank you

**Student's Transcript:**

> Hello guys, my name is duanrunyan,and you can call meScarlett. Studen id:5475 I choose 3S to describe myself. Sparky,beacause I often have many spark of ideas, and igniting engaging discussion with playful curiosity.Self-aware,I have always been quite clear about my goals and value my own feelings.Skeptical,sometimes,I really enjoy criticizing and doubting things, which sometimes makes it difficult for me to quickly accept new ideas. However, it also helps me think deeply. To talk about my background ,which shape my view of global citizenship ,I think the most important things is my hobby,I have always been a fan of multiculturalism since childhood, even at that time I don’t know this word, from literary works around the world,I steeped in cross-cultural dialogue,by publishing comments and create works,i build digital interconnection with international friends , who have similar preference with me.Gradully,I begins to explore the cultural, historical, political and economic issues underlying the work. Personally, being a global citizen not mean to me as a fixed identity, but as a continuous practice. I see it as the willingness to engage empathetically with diverse perspectives, while critically examining my own positionality. I will rise Awareness of global issues inequality, climate, justice.And have Responsibility to act ethically and sustainably beyond borders.And remenber,Critical engagement—respecting diversity without romantically imagine it, and examining my privileges and biases. Always reminded me that true global citizenship requires active listening, not just connection. It’s less about where you’re from, and more about how you choose to navigate and contribute to a shared world. thank you.

**Student's Transcript:**

> “My name is fan ching yin. You can call me George, and if you want me to give, give you a three best adjective to describe myself. I guess I am creative, open mind and persistent. So I think it's, it is because of my strong artistic background. In order to make an impressive artwork, I have to do a good idea brainstorming or even interpret the same concept in different way. So it requires a strong creative mind, or even open mind, to accept many point of views. So I strongly believe that my strong artistic background can assist me to become a good global citizen. Is because, for me, the concept of global citizenship&nbsp;is about a global vision and and and the ability to understanding other people and that may that may be from different background, or even unique tradition and unusual idea that I haven't here before. So for me, being a good global citizen is quite challenging, because sometimes I prefer staying alone rather than talk to others. So my experience of socialization is is insufficient so, so being a good global citizen is like a comfort zone, step step outside of comfort zone from individual to the society. So I think I can do is take social responsibility, engage more like voluntary work, or even join more social activity to enhance myself.“

Hello everyone! My name is Fang Ke, but you can call me Jennie. Today ,I gonna share a bit about myself and my views on global citizenship.If I had to describe myself in three words, I would choose motivated, observant, and open-minded. 
 
To start ，I’m a motivated person ,cause I always seek to improve myself and take on new challenges in my studies and personal life. like travel to a new place. 
I’m also observant; I love to notice the little details around me, which helps me understand other perspectives.Then, I’m open-minded person, due to II welcome new ideas, even if they differernt from my own beliefs. 
Growing up in Shenzhen has shaped my view of global citizenship. Living in such a dynamic and diverse city, I see how people from various backgrounds come together. For instance, during the Spring festival, I saw how different cultures celebrated together, sharing their traditions and learning from each other. This experience taught me how important it is to connect with others and appreciate our differences. 
To me, being a global citizen means aware of and taking action on global issues like SDG.like even our daily actions can make a difference. 
That all ,Thank you for your listening!

**Student's Transcript:**

> Here is my unedited video transcript:  Hi, my name is Jin zijie, and you can also call me Joyce. I would like to use versatile, understanding and sensitive to describe myself. I will give my shoulder to my friends to cry on during their tough time. And I always show others more forgiveness. However, I often have my own emotions. For example, when I first came to HKBU, I really miss my families. And as I haven’t adapted to a completely new environment, I felt a little bit lonely. Fortunately, I have got myself  back on track now. For the next question, because we are surrounded by the  internet, we have access to a lot of global information, which may impact us potentially. What’s more, the local environment and digital information is also important. And in my opinion, a global citizen is someone who can hold their local and national  identity dearly. We must put global interests first,  it’s our duty to share human values. Facing global challenges together and contributing our own strength, maybe we can have a great global environment.  Step2:

**Student's Transcript:**

> Raw Transcript   Here's my unedited video transcript:    Hi everyone, I’m Liu Weijia, and you can call me Sua. If I had to describe myself with three words, they would be imaginative, introverted, and curious—let me tell you why.  First, I’m imaginative. In my daily life, I love creating&nbsp; stories .Admittedly, I’m not a great writer yet—most of my stories get left unfinished. But even so, I always have new ideas for stories popping up, which is why I think “imaginative” fits me well.  Second, I’m introverted. I prefer staying alone and doing things by myself, like reading or painting. For me, this alone time isn’t just relaxing—it also gives me space to improve my skills, whether it’s understanding a book better or practicing a new painting technique.  Third, I’m curious. I always want to explore new fields, like baking or pottery. Even though my passion for each new thing might not last very long, I still pick up useful skills from every experience.  Now, let’s talk about global citizenship. To me, being a global citizen means seeking common ground while reserving differences. I first learned this idea from my textbook, and I deeply agree with it. Cultural differences exist everywhere, and we can’t erase them. So instead of trying to change other’s cultures, what we can do is to try to understand them. This way, we can truly exchange cultural ideas, and broaden our own horizons.  Thank you for listening.

“Hello everyone,my name is Liu Xinyi and you can call me Valentina. I'm a student majoring in Business Administration Global Entertainment. Three words that l think can describe me are creative, empathetic and globally minded. Creativity drives me to explore music world. I have studied the flute for over 10 years and it built my creativity. Empathy helps me to understand different perspectives and being globally minded means that I'm real always eager to learn from various culture and countries.  
On my background about the interest in global entertainment has really shaped my view of global citizenship about how entertainment flows across borders, like K-pop and Hollywood. And I think these cultural products can connect people together. I realize that global citizenship is about more than just above geography and it can recognized our humanity through culture art and also stories. In the future my maior will help me to think about how entertainment can be a bridge and can help us to understand different communities. 
As for me being a global citizen means that we need to take responsibility for the whole world. For example we need to take action about solving global issues, to respect different cultures. Using my skills whether in entertainment business or creative storytelling. We can contribute positively to the global community. And I think I can help to amplify diverse stories and voices. Yeah, thank you.”

Hello everyone, my name is ZHAO Mohan and I’m a year 1 student from the Global Entertainment program. 
 
If I choose three words to describe myself, they will be passionate, adaptable and open-minded. As I’m a Global Entertainment student, I’m really interested in the entertainment industry and want to work in this field in the future. And I think Hong Kong is a perfect place for me to connect with entertainment opportunities. At the same time, I think I’m adaptable. I’m good at adjusting to a new environment, and it’s an essential ability in the entertainment world. Finally, I try to stay open-minded so I can learn from different cultures. 
 
I was born and raised in Hebei province, which is near Beijing, the capital of China. It’s easy for me to be exposed to the national affairs and learn how citizens can contribute to the city. In Hebei, we emphasis community a lot, so I realized this concept from a young age. And now, I came to Hong Kong for study, it’s a cross-regional, and cross-cultural thing which indeed deepens my understanding about global citizenship. 
 
However, we are not just citizens of our country, but also  the whole world. So it’s our responsibility to focus on how to make the world more sustainable, how to make the world more peaceful. It’s important for us to know that we are global citizens. And it’s not just a slogan, it’s more important to really do something. For me, being a global citizen means that rejecting discrimination，living a more sustainable life and doing meaningful things in our daily life. And although they may be small, but the can be useful. Hope I can do my best and make the world more beautiful.

Hello everyone, I’m Xie Kai Wing and my study program is visual arts. By choosing three words to describe myself, I will choose curious, connective and friendly. So I like to exchange ideas with other people and make friends. During my middle school years, I have studied world history, and one of the topics that we learned is international cooperation. We studied how countries around the world that cooperate in areas such as healthcare, economic and environment to address common global challenges, and this led me to believe that being a global citizen means people from different backgrounds offering help when others are in need, that will create a better life for everyone, because we are getting more help from other countries like this, and for example, we can follow some natural disasters in other countries through television news. And that's donating online, to share, to show our care to them, and also delivering some helpful materials like this, and I believe this will foster a more peaceful world. Also, a lot of common problems are leading to us, like air pollution that all of us have to continue to pay attention to the whole world, because it will affect all of us, not just one of the country, but it's the world. So being a global citizen means we have the responsibility to help different people, and it's not just saying, but a call of action. Thank you.

> Raw Transcript     Here's my unedited video transcript  Hello, everyone. My name is bung Shu I'm a year one student majoring in FASS. I will answer the three questions in this two minute video. So at first, I want to introduce myself in three words. The first one is self-discipline. Second is creative, and last one is independent, because I like to do someto do list, daily schedule, and do anything else I don't like, just to make me a better person. So I think this rewards can describe me well. And number two question is, how my background shift my view of citizenship, because my father is a professor teaching in a college in my hometown, so his mind is open, more open than others in at his age, he taught me a lot. So I realized that I'm not only a person in this nation, but all in my nation, but also a citizen live in the whole world when I was so young, about about 10 years old or 11 years old. So the last question is, what does being a global citizen means to me? That means I, I'm, I must to do a lot, I must to call for peace or and provide help to the people who need help, no matter he or she are from what nation so it's my answer. Thank you. So.

Here's my unedited video transcript: 
 My name is GUOJIRU.I am a student from the Faculty of Art and Social Science. Three words to describe me. I think first words is reserved. My MBTI is INT. It is not means that I am not good at making friends. I just don’t like to connected with others first. The second word I think maybe is grounded. Well you know. I love money, so I think I am a realist. I don’t like to waste my time in some boring thing. The finally word I think is procrastinate. I try to change this. 
  The second question. When I first time saw the concept of global citizenship, I recall the other concept is a community with a shared future for mankind. Because in high school, I studied politics. I think I have had some understanding of this concept. Also in high school, I attended some activities as a volunteer. So I think I have had some ability that being sympthon with other. 
  The last question. Personally, I think being that kind of people is quite challenging for me. Cause we need to learn some knowledge like other’s views and positions. We need to learn other country’s culture and laws. We need raise our awareness of having critical thinking, like environmental protecting, something we don’t care in daily life.
