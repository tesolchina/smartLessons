###Step 1: Raw Transcript Here's my unedited video transcript: Hello everyone. I'm Cao Wen Yan, and you can call me Yanny. So I would like to use three words to describe myself. First one is introverts and introverts person and outgoing and innovative. So as you see, I'm an introvert and extrovert person at the same time, because if you first meet me and I'm trying to talk to you, but after you get well known about me, I'm pretty sure that I welcome you to chat with me, or I like to chat with teachers in my free time. So yeah, and I always like to express my emotions and stories through creative arts, yeah, through making artworks. So because my older sister is a teacher who always teach Sen students, which means that I always observed and find out that if we are adults or people who gain more abilities, we should have responsibility, that we should guide or help younger children, which means we should nurture next generations with mature cooperations. Yeah, so. And also, I think, as a innovative person, we should promote more like diverse and creative solutions that which can dealing with some social problems, and I think we also carry out duties that we should maintain the rules and also contribute to society. Thank. 2. Error Analysis Transcription Errors: Pronunciation Issues: -my name'Wing Yan' pronanced as 'Wen Yan' -pronance 'shy' unclearly which transcript as 'trying' Unidiomatic Expressions: -say too many times with 'yeah' and 'uh' during each sentences(not fluency enough) ### Step 3: Self-Assessment A.

### Step 1: Raw Transcript Here's my unedited video transcript: Hi! I'm chen hiu shuen, you can call me sharon. In this video, I will talk about three questions. Who are you? Which three words describe you and why? Three words I'd use to describe myself are curious, empathetic, and proactive. First is curious because I love learning about different cultures and global issues. Second is empathetic because I try to understand others' perspectives and experiences. Third is proactive because I believe in taking small actions to contribute to positive change. How does your background shape your view of global citizenship? My background has shaped my view of global citizenship by teaching me the value of diversity and connection. I am a Hong Kong citizen, but I attended an international school in Guangzhou since childhood, which allowed me to interact with people from diverse backgrounds. I learned that our world is interconnected. It made me realize that global citizenship isn‚Äôt about where you‚Äôre from, but how you engage with and care for the world beyond yourself.

### Step 1: Raw Transcript Here's my unedited video transcript: Hi everyone my name is Cheng Chui Ling and you can call me Aimee. If I need to use three words to introduce myself,i will definitely choose curiousÔºåcompassionate and good lisener. First,I think I am curious because I like to explore new things and think about "why" about everything. This kind of questioning has prompted me to change from passively accepting the teacher's teaching to actively looking for information. Second, I think I am very compassionate because I can always put myself in other people's shoes and take the initiative to understand their situations. For example, I can empathise with the loneliness of elderly &nbsp; &nbsp; living alone, so I participate in some volunteer activities and stay with elderly people living alone at home. Third, I think I am a good listener because I never rush to criticize or comment, nor do I interrupt others impatiently. Instead, I listen to what others say patiently before giving some suggestions. This also allows me to be very comfortable in teamwork and listen to and understand the opinions of different team members. Then, my background influence my view of global citizenship is that there are foreign teachers in my primary school.I think they are friendly and are my first window to the world. Through them, I realized that I am not the only one living in the world. There are many people from different countries, cultures, and languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the earth, and we live together on the earth. It made me realize that we are all part of a global society. Being a global citizen means taking on the responsibilities of a citizen, focusing on major global issues like global warming and the Sustainable Development Goals rather than just focusing on my own concerns. And I want to actually do things well, not just pay lip service to them. Thank you

Raw transcripts - step 1 ‚ÄúMy name is fan ching yin. You can call me George, and if you want me to give, give you a three best adjective to describe myself. I guess I am creative, open mind and persistent. So I think it's, it is because of my strong artistic background. In order to make an impressive artwork, I have to do a good idea brainstorming or even interpret the same concept in different way. So it requires a strong creative mind, or even open mind, to accept many point of views. So I strongly believe that my strong artistic background can assist me to become a good global citizen. Is because, for me, the concept of global citizenship&nbsp; is about a global vision and and and the ability to understanding other people and that may that may be from different background, or even unique tradition and unusual idea that I haven't here before. So for me, being a good global citizen is quite challenging, because sometimes I prefer staying alone rather than talk to others. So my experience of socialization is is insufficient so, so being a good global citizen is like a comfort zone, step step outside of comfort zone from individual to the society. So I think I can do is take social responsibility, engage more like voluntary work, or even join more social activity to enhance myself.‚Äú

So I think I can do is take social responsibility, engage more like voluntary work, or even join more social activity to enhance myself.‚Äú Step 2: Error Analysis (Edited version) My name is Fan Ching Yin, but you can call me George. If I had to choose three adjectives to describe myself, I would say I am creative, open-minded, and persistent. These qualities come from my strong artistic background. To create an impressive artwork, I need to brainstorm good ideas and sometimes interpret the same concept in different ways. This process requires a strong sense of creativity and an open mind to accept different points of view. I strongly believe that my artistic background can help me become a good global citizen. To me, global citizenship means having a global vision and the ability to understand people from different backgrounds, cultures, and even unfamiliar traditions or unique ideas I may not have encountered before. However, I also find it quite challenging. Sometimes I prefer being alone rather than talking to others, so my social experience is limited. For me, becoming a good global citizen means stepping out of my comfort zone‚Äîfrom focusing on myself to engaging more with society. What I can do is take more social responsibility, participate in volunteer work, and join more social activities to improve myself and grow as a global citizen.

Content Analysis -Connection between questions: successfully explain how my personal traits, namely open-mindedness, creativity and persistence assisting or shaping me to become good grossly citizens. -Three words connection: Yes, as these words are the representation of my artistic vision and I have explained that how to contribute the purpose of global citizenship. -Thematic focus rating (3/5): Especially in Q.3 I should elaborate and explain more what I can do to become a good global citizen.

Significant grammatical patterns- My grammar is generally accepted in terms of speaking. However, I should avoid Chinese style English. Besides, use less filler words.

I think there are significant problems with the content of my video. First of all, I did not connect my three characteristics with the theme of global citizenship. The text is not coherent. Secondly, my vocabulary is quite basic and not advanced, so I need to expand my vocabulary. Thirdly, I failed to accurately describe my background and did not connect it with the concept of a global citizen. Finally, there is a lack of a deep understanding of the significance of becoming a global citizen. &nbsp; Hello everyone, My name is Fu Jinwen. You can also call me Windy. I'm currently studying at Hong Kong Baptist University. First, I'll describe myself with three words: curious, ambitious, creative. The curiosity motivates me to explore the world and be eager to learn more about the cultures of other countries.I have unrealistic dreams. I want to become a useful person to my country and contribute to social progress. It means I am expected to persistent perseverance and a global perspective. I have enough creativity and imagination to do whatever I want to do. I will also apply my creativity to promoting the development of entertainment worldwide. . I think everyone is a global citizen and has their own responsibilities. In the global village, we should work together to make the world a better place. Living in peaceful China gives me more opportunities to learn more knowledge, experience the world and enhance my awareness of my global citizenship. Studying in Hong Kong has given me a platform to communicate with foreign students and an opportunity to understand the cultures of many countries. This is my chance to open my eyes to the world and cultivate my global citizenship awareness. I feel honored to be a global citizen. In my opinion, Becoming a global citizen means that I will undergo a transformation, have more opportunities to understand diverse cultures, and have more development opportunities. Exposure to diverse cultures will enhance my cross-cultural communication skills and adaptability.Thank you.

### Step 1: Raw Transcript Here's my unedited video transcript: My name is GUOJIRU.I am a student from the Faculty of Art and Social Science. Three words to describe me. I think first words is reserved. My MBTI is INT. It is not means that I am not good at making friends. I just don‚Äôt like to connected with others first. The second word I think maybe is grounded. Well you know. I love money, so I think I am a realist. I don‚Äôt like to waste my time in some boring thing. The finally word I think is procrastinate. I try to change this. The second question. When I first time saw the concept of global citizenship, I recall the other concept is a community with a shared future for mankind. Because in high school, I studied politics. I think I have had some understanding of this concept. Also in high school, I attended some activities as a volunteer. So I think I have had some ability that being sympthon with other. The last question. Personally, I think being that kind of people is quite challenging for me. Cause we need to learn some knowledge like other‚Äôs views and positions. We need to learn other country‚Äôs culture and laws. We need raise our awareness of having critical thinking, like environmental protecting, something we don‚Äôt care in daily life. ### Step 2: Error Analysis Transcription Errors: 1.Wrong word -Using a wrong word ‚ÄúSympthon‚Äù. It should be ‚Äúsympathetic‚Äù 2.Express one-sidedness - In the second question, the concept of global citizenship was understood one-sidedly based on high school knowledge, lacking life experience. - Used "you know" too frequently as a filler word 3. Technical Issues: -The pronunciation is not clear enough. ### Step 3: Self-Assessment A. Content Analysis: - The three adjectives listed have not been combined with the concept of global citizenship. - The background knowledge does not provide a specific explanation of the concept of global citizenship but merely discusses the high school learning experience in isolation, without essentially grasping the meaning of global citizenship. B. Language Analysis: - Using "I think" too frequently at the beginning of a statement makes the language lack professionalism, become overly colloquial, and have simple vocabulary. - The speaker's speaking speed was too slow, with frequent pauses, and the pronunciation was not standard. C. Areas for Improvement: - Reduce the use of "you know" in oral expressions and instead use more professional terms to enhance persuasiveness. Also, pay more attention to the standard pronunciation. - I should incorporate more real-life examples and enhance our understanding of the concept of global citizenship. We cannot simply apply existing theories mechanically.

Step1:Raw Transcript Here is my unedited video transcript: Hi, my name is Jin zijie, and you can also call me Joyce. I would like to use versatile, understanding and sensitive to describe myself. I will give my shoulder to my friends to cry on during their tough time. And I always show others more forgiveness. However, I often have my own emotions. For example, when I first came to HKBU, I really miss my families. And as I haven‚Äôt adapted to a completely new environment, I felt a little bit lonely. Fortunately, I have got myself back on track now. For the next question, because we are surrounded by the internet, we have access to a lot of global information, which may impact us potentially. What‚Äôs more, the local environment and digital information is also important. And in my opinion, a global citizen is someone who can hold their local and national identity dearly. We must put global interests first, it‚Äôs our duty to share human values. Facing global challenges together and contributing our own strength, maybe we can have a great global environment.

Step1: Raw Transrcipt Hi, I'm Lee Tsz Yan, you can call me Alissa, I'm are visual art student. Today i will use three words to describe myself.First, i will use artistic because as a visual art student, I always have different ideas to express and sometimes i will do some ceramic and craft like a piece of cake box and you can put some necklaces or small things.It's very convenience and also I do love to filming a " fit check"video and matching different outfits of today.And also i will use shy to describe myself because i'm not really outgoing person and I always afraid to talk with others.I know that will become a prroblem in future because maybe there will have a group discussion and prsentation are waiting for me and I will overcome that.I will try my best.Lastly, I will use vibrant because I am full of energy to do what im interested,only what I'm interested,like i will holding a pencil drawing a picture whole day or even going outside sit there and observe people all day. Yeah. And so let's move on to the second bullet point. My background shaped my global cityzenship by not only using the artistic technique or skills, drawing or painting but also the atory and the culture throung whole the world.Yeah,And also I used to take the CSD"Citizenship and Social Development" lesson during my secondary school. So these all makes me more empathetic and compassnate about the world. And I believe that to being a global citizen means I have a responsibility to contribute the inclusive world.Maybe in the future I become an artist.Yes, I become an artist and I think I can express some message like " stopping the war" for audience. Yes, I konw that may not helpfui but I can even to sending a message to raise the awareness about what is happened our surrounding for the er via my artwork. Yes,artwork.So...yes,that's the end of my sharing. Thank you :P Step2:Error Analysis - Verb Tense Consistency "I do love to filming..." "I will holding a pencil..." "I become an artist." -Word Choice &amp; Usage "It's very convenience." "fit check video and matching different outfits of today." "there will have a group discussion..." "to being a global citizen..." "raise the awareness about what is happened..." - Clarity &amp; Flow "like a piece of cake box and you can put some necklaces or small things." "for the er via my artwork.." Step3:Self-Assessment A. Content Analysis: - Some ideas feel slightly rushed or loosely connected. For example, transitioning from your personality traits to your global citizenship could be smoother. - Try to expand on why these experiences matter to you. What did you learn from making art or taking the CSD class? B. Language Analysis: Strengths: - The vocabulary is expressive and creative (e.g., ‚Äúfit check,‚Äù ‚Äúvibrant,‚Äù ‚Äúceramic and craft‚Äù). - Casual, friendly language that makes your speech feel authentic and relatable. Areas for Improvement: -Grammar: Watch out for verb tense consistency and subject-verb agreement. - Word choice: Some phrases are unclear or awkward e.g., ‚Äúvery convenience‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúvery convenient‚Äù C. Fluency and Delivery Analysis: - The tone is warm and expressive‚Äîgreat for engaging an audience. - Show genuine enthusiasm, especially when talking about your art. - Areas for improvement: 1. Practice pacing: Some sentences run long and could be broken up for clarity. 2.Confidence: You mention being shy, but your ideas are strong‚Äîpractice will help you speak with more assurance. 3.Pronunciation (if spoken): Be mindful of words like ‚Äúcitizenship‚Äù and ‚Äúcompassionate‚Äù to ensure they‚Äôre clear. ---

Step 1: Raw Transcript Here's my unedited video transcript: Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Liu Weijia, and you can call me Sua. If I had to describe myself with three words, they would be imaginative, introverted, and curious‚Äîlet me tell you why.First, I‚Äôm imaginative. In my daily life, I love creating stories .Admittedly, I‚Äôm not a great writer yet‚Äîmost of my stories get left unfinished. But even so, I always have new ideas for stories popping up, which is why I think ‚Äúimaginative‚Äù fits me well.Second, I‚Äôm introverted. I prefer staying alone and doing things by myself, like reading or painting. For me, this alone time isn‚Äôt just relaxing‚Äîit also gives me space to improve my skills, whether it‚Äôs understanding a book better or practicing a new painting technique.Third, I‚Äôm curious. I always want to explore new fields, like baking or pottery. Even though my passion for each new thing might not last very long, I still pick up useful skills from every experience.Now, let‚Äôs talk about global citizenship. To me, being a global citizen means seeking common ground while reserving differences. I first learned this idea from my textbook, and I deeply agree with it. Cultural differences exist everywhere, and we can‚Äôt erase them. So instead of trying to change other‚Äôs cultures, what we can do is to try to understand them. This way, we can truly exchange cultural ideas, and broaden our own horizons.Thank you for listening.

Empathy helps me to understand different perspectives and being globally minded means that I'm real always eager to learn from various culture and countries. On my background about the interest in global entertainment has really shaped my view of global citizenship about how entertainment flows across borders, like K-pop and Hollywood. And I think these cultural products can connect people together. I realize that global citizenship is about more than just above geography and it can recognized our humanity through culture art and also stories. In the future my maior will help me to think about how entertainment can be a bridge and can help us to understand different communities. As for me being a global citizen means that we need to take responsibility for the whole world. For example we need to take action about solving global issues, to respect different cultures.

Step 1. Raw outline I am Sze Chun Hei from faculty of arts and social sciences. I would use ordinary, unconfident and studious these three words to describe me because I don‚Äôt have any outstanding abilities or talents and I am not special or very important to the society. Also, my English is not very good so I am quite unconfident that I can handle the assessment at university. Last, I want to learn more new knowledge and skills at university like I have taken the japanese course.I am a social science student and this is my background. After taking the course invitations to social science, i understand every countries and societies are connected in various aspects in the social world because of globalisation. For example, the linked exchange rate system in Hong Kong that linked US dollar to Hong Kong dollars. Moreover, we are all live in the same physical world and the environmental policies of other countries would have some effects on the climate change to a certain extent and climate change is a serious global issue and it will affect all the countries. Therefore, it shapes my view that the whole world actually don‚Äôt have boundaries , most of the things happened on this world are related to our lives and people are one of the citizens of this world. As being a global citizen, I think I am a part of this world and I should aware the political and economic situation of other countries, the war that happened in the world and the natural issues of the world such as climate change. I should not have the thought that those issues are none of my business and I should donate to those people who are still suffering from war. Absorbing different information to understand the world is essential even though I can‚Äôt change the world. I also believe that having these knowledge in my mind is useful for my career. Step 2: Error Analysis Unidiomatic expressions: -unconfident ‚Üí not very confident / lacking confidence -learn more new knowledge ‚Üí gain more knowledge -have the thought that ‚Üí think/believe that -natural issues of the world ‚Üí environmental issues Grammar ‚ÄúLast‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúLastly‚Äù ‚Äúthe whole world ‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt‚Äù (not ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù). ‚Äúare all live‚Äù ‚Äúall live‚Äù ‚Äúthese knowledge‚Äù‚Üí ‚Äúthis knowledge‚Äù Step 3. Self assessment using the rubric A. Content analysis 1. I didn‚Äôt connect the three question into a coherent narrative. 2. There are no coherence between the three words and my background and global citizenship views. 3. Thematic focus: 2 There are no sufficient connections between those three answers of the questions. B. Language analysis 1. Strength is using relevant vocabulary globalisation 2. Weakness are only use simple vocabulary, repetition of general words Module-specific terms : globalisation C. Fluency and delivery analysis My speech flow is not very fast but pronunciation is not very clear I want to improve my pronunciation and fluency.

### Step 1: Raw Transcript Here's my unedited video transcript: Hello. My name is Wan Choi Yi, or you can call me Koi. So to use free word to describe myself, I would say it is creative, curious and focused. So to start first, since I'm official art student, in order to create a good artwork, it is important to receive different creative ideas, different information from others. And secondly, I would say I'm a person who driven by questions, not just the answers. I always want to know the why behind the question. And also, I'm a person who focus to achieve my goals instead of working with others. I like to work a lot more so that I can focus my own job better. Therefore, I would use creative careers and focus to describe myself and to the next question, how does my background shape my field of global citizenship? I think global citizenship is not only the government but also the individuals. It is the connection between you and me. Build up the bridges which call community. It is not about where your passport is from. It's about where your empathy is direct. So to me, being a global citizen is more than just status. I think I will focus more on global issues such as global warming and create more artworks to draw public attention to those global climate crisis and that's so thank you. Thank.

Hello, my name is Wong Yu Ying, you can call me Avery.I'm a student of Visual Arts.The three words I would use to describe myself are introspective, considerate, and curious. I believe observing myself is a good way to understand who am I. I describe myself as a considerate person is because i strive to understand and connect with people from all walks from life. And finally, I say curious because I‚Äôm always eager to learn about new perspectives. Although I am relatively introverted and silent, I am definitely devoted.Growing up in a multicultural society taught me that there‚Äôs more than one way to see the world. Studying history in secondary school showed me how interconnected our global systems are. Also, studying in visual arts made me appreciate both our differences and our shared humanity. Also, recognising that I am part of a worldwide community, and my actions have an impact that extends beyond my immediate surroundings. The reason why global is global is because we are part of the world. We are all individuals, but is one.To me, being a global citizen means carrying of a sense of responsibility not just for my local community, but for the world.I‚Äôm excited to explore these ideas in this course. Thank you.

Step 1: Raw Transcript (Provided) Hello everyone, I‚Äôm Xie Kai Wing and my study program is visual arts. By choosing three words to describe myself, I will choose curious, connective and friendly. So I like to exchange ideas with other people and make friends. During my middle school years, I have studied world history, and one of the topics that we learned is international cooperation. We studied how countries around the world that cooperate in areas such as healthcare, economic and environment to address common global challenges, and this led me to believe that being a global citizen means people from different backgrounds offering help when others are in need, that will create a better life for everyone, because we are getting more help from other countries like this, and for example, we can follow some natural disasters in other countries through television news. And that's donating online, to share, to show our care to them, and also delivering some helpful materials like this, and I believe this will foster a more peaceful world. Also, a lot of common problems are leading to us, like air pollution that all of us have to continue to pay attention to the whole world, because it will affect all of us, not just one of the country, but it's the world. So being a global citizen means we have the responsibility to help different people, and it's not just saying, but a call of action. Thank you. --- Step 2: Error Analysis 1. Pronunciation Issues (if applicable from your video) ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúConnective‚Äù at ~0:15 ‚Äì Slight hesitation, may sound unclear to listeners, consider using ‚Äúconnected‚Äù or ‚Äúconnecting.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúEconomic‚Äù at ~0:40 ‚Äì Slight mispronunciation, could be clearer. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúResponsibility‚Äù at ~1:35 ‚Äì Minor stumble, work on slow, clear pronunciation. 2. Unidiomatic Expressions ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúConnective‚Äù is not commonly used as an adjective for people. ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù or ‚Äúsociable‚Äù might be more natural. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúDonating online, to share, to show our care to them, and also delivering some helpful materials like this‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì The sentence is a bit long and unclear. Try splitting it or clarifying the actions. ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúA lot of common problems are leading to us, like air pollution‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì Consider rephrasing: ‚ÄúMany global problems affect all of us, such as air pollution‚Ä¶‚Äù 3. Technical Issues ‚Ä¢ If your video had any background noise or audio distortion, note the timestamp and describe the issue (e.g., ‚ÄúMinor background noise at 0:55‚Äù). ‚Ä¢ If you spoke too quickly or hesitated, note where (e.g., ‚ÄúSpoke too quickly when describing global citizenship at 1:10‚Äù). --- Step 3: Self-Assessment A. Content Analysis ‚Ä¢ Connection between questions: You introduced your three words and linked them to your actions and beliefs about global citizenship. Good job connecting curiosity and friendliness to your willingness to engage and help others. ‚Ä¢ Three words connection: ‚ÄúCurious,‚Äù ‚Äúconnective,‚Äù and ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù were introduced, but ‚Äúconnective‚Äù could be better explained or replaced with ‚Äúconnected‚Äù or ‚Äúsociable.‚Äù You did well linking ‚Äúcurious‚Äù to your study of world history and ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù to exchanging ideas and making friends. ‚Ä¢ Thematic focus rating: 3.5/5. You discussed global citizenship and gave clear examples (e.g., donating online, helping after natural disasters), but could include more personal stories or specific actions you‚Äôve taken to show your engagement. B. Language Analysis Strengths: ‚Ä¢ Used vocabulary related to global issues (e.g., ‚Äúinternational cooperation,‚Äù ‚Äúhealthcare,‚Äù ‚Äúenvironment,‚Äù ‚Äúair pollution‚Äù). ‚Ä¢ Tried to use transitional phrases (e.g., ‚Äúfor example,‚Äù ‚Äúalso‚Äù). Areas for Improvement: ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúConnective‚Äù is not standard; use ‚Äúconnected‚Äù or ‚Äúsociable.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Some sentences are long and could be split for clarity. ‚Ä¢ Could use more academic or module-specific terms (e.g., ‚Äúsustainability,‚Äù ‚Äúinterdependence,‚Äù ‚Äúmulticulturalism‚Äù). ‚Ä¢ Reduce filler phrases (e.g., ‚Äúlike this,‚Äù ‚Äúso‚Äù). C. Fluency and Delivery Analysis ‚Ä¢ Speech flow was generally smooth, but a few hesitations and rushed sections (e.g., when talking about global problems). ‚Ä¢ Work on clearer pronunciation of challenging words (‚Äúeconomic,‚Äù ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù). ‚Ä¢ Areas for improvement: 1. Slow down during complex explanations to ensure clarity. 2. Articulate key terms carefully. 3. Practice more natural intonation, especially when emphasizing important points. --- Specific Suggestions ‚Ä¢ Be specific about examples: Next time, mention a personal experience, such as a time you participated in a donation drive, volunteered, or discussed global issues with friends. ‚Ä¢ Be honest about areas for improvement: Note where you felt nervous, rushed, or unsure, and set a goal to practice those sections. ‚Ä¢ Connect your three words meaningfully: For example, ‚ÄúMy curiosity led me to study world history, my connectedness helps me form friendships across cultures, and my friendliness makes it easy for me to support others.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Refer to timestamps: E.g., ‚ÄúAt 0:45, I described international cooperation, but I could have given a more concrete example.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Add personal experiences: E.g., ‚ÄúLast year, I organized a small fundraiser with my classmates after a natural disaster in another country.‚Äù --- Example Revision (for future improvement): ‚ÄúHello everyone, I‚Äôm Xie Kai Wing and I study visual arts. Three words I‚Äôd use to describe myself are curious, connected, and friendly. My curiosity led me to study world history in middle school, where I first learned about international cooperation. I love exchanging ideas and making new friends, which has helped me connect with people from different backgrounds. For example, after a recent earthquake abroad, I joined an online donation campaign with my classmates. I believe that being a global citizen means taking action to help others, regardless of where they are. Issues like air pollution affect us all, and as global citizens, we have a responsibility to work together for a better world. Thank you.‚Äù --- Summary Table Aspect Strengths Areas for Improvement Suggestions Content Good global examples, clear values More personal stories Add specific actions you took Language Relevant vocabulary, transitions Use more academic terms, clearer sentences Replace ‚Äúconnective‚Äù with ‚Äúconnected‚Äù Fluency &amp; Delivery Smooth overall Slow down, clearer pronunciation Practice intonation, articulation

Okay, when I first saw this question, my immediate reaction was that I really didn‚Äôt know how to answer it. But if I had to pick three words to describe myself, I‚Äôd probably go with: introverted, creative, and idealistic. Introverted means‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt usually take the initiative to socialize; I prefer spending time alone. As for being creative‚Ä¶ honestly, throughout middle school and high school, I‚Äôve enjoyed writing my own stories and drawing kinda abstract doodles. And when it comes to idealism‚Ä¶ I guess it‚Äôs like whenever I get an idea, I just want to go for it, and I kinda blindly believe that I can make it happen. On the topic of global citizenship‚ÄîI took a politics class in high school. It helped me understand the challenges that the whole world is facing together, and it also exposed me to lots of different cultures. To me, a global citizen should have an international perspective, a sense of responsibility, the willingness to take action, and empathy toward others. Yeah‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs pretty much what I wanted to say. Thanks for listening! Really nice to meet you all!

1.transcript You can call me Laura.Let's move on to the first question.When I first saw this question, actually, I have no idea about it, but if I have to choose three words to describe myself,I'd probably go with introverted, creative and idealisticabout the about theintroverted, it means That I do not often participate in social activities, I prefer to spend time alone,activity because I keep writing short novel since my middle school,when It comes to the idealistic,when Iwant to, want to do something. I just go for it and kindly believe that I can make it.On the topic of citizenship, global citizenship.I I took a coursein my high school.It's politics, it's uh.It's helped me learn that challenges that the whole world is facing together, and exposed different culture to me, to me, a goal. A global citizen should have international perspective and the things ofthe things of responsibility The willingness to take action and sympathy that all I want to see. Thanks for your attention. 2.AI use Errors &amp; Correction Suggestions 1. Repetition &amp; Hesitation: ¬∑ Original: "about the about the introverted" ¬∑ Suggestion: Avoid repeating words. Pause briefly instead. You can say, "Regarding 'introverted'..." or "First, 'introverted'..." 2. Word Choice &amp; Grammar: ¬∑ Original: "I prefer to spend time alone,activity because I keep writing short novel..." ¬∑ Suggestion: Connect the ideas more smoothly. "...I prefer to spend time alone pursuing personal activities like writing short stories/novels..." ¬∑ Original: "since my middle school" ¬∑ Suggestion: "since middle school" (no article needed) or "since I was in middle school". 3. Sentence Structure (Run-on sentence): ¬∑ Original: "when It comes to the idealistic,when I want to, want to do something. I just go for it and kindly believe that I can make it." ¬∑ Suggestion: This is a bit fragmented. Combine the ideas: "When it comes to being idealistic, it means that when I want to do something, I just go for it and firmly believe that I can make it happen." 4. Grammar &amp; Prepositions: ¬∑ Original: "It's politics, it's uh." ¬∑ Suggestion: "It was a politics course." (Use the correct noun and past tense "was" for something in high school). ¬∑ Original: "It's helped me learn that challenges..." / "and exposed different culture to me, to me, a goal." ¬∑ Suggestion: "It helped me learn about the challenges..." and "exposed me to different cultures. For me, a global citizen should have..." (The phrase "to me, a goal" was unclear). 5. Word Choice &amp; Fluency: ¬∑ Original: "and the things of the things of responsibility The willingness to take action and sympathy that all I want to see." ¬∑ Suggestion: This part is difficult to understand. You likely mean: "a sense of responsibility, the willingness to take action, and empathy. That is what I believe it means." ("Sympathy" is often replaced with "empathy" in this context). Overall Feedback Your answer is excellent because it is personal, honest, and structured. You successfully answered both parts of the question. The main areas for improvement are: ¬∑ Fluency: Reducing repetitions and hesitations (like "uh"). ¬∑ Prepositions: Paying attention to small words like "about", "of", and "to". ¬∑ Sentence Flow: Connecting your ideas into slightly longer, smoother sentences. 3.self assessment Self-Assessment of My Speech ¬∑ Fluency &amp; Hesitation: ¬∑ Observation: There were several repetitions ("about the about the," "to me, to me") and filler sounds ("uh"). This breaks the flow and makes me sound less confident. ¬∑ Grammar &amp; Precision: ¬∑ Observation: I made some small grammatical errors, like missing articles ("a short novel," "a politics course"), incorrect prepositions ("learn that challenges" should be "learn about the challenges"), and run-on sentences. ¬∑ Clarity of Message: ¬∑ Observation: The last sentence about global citizenship became a little tangled ("the things of responsibility... that all I want to see"). They weren't expressed clearly. Summary: My strength lies in organizing thoughtful and personal content. My main goal for the next practice is to improve fluency by reducing repetitions and to focus on grammatical accuracy, especially with small words, to make my speech smoother and more professional.

Step 1 Hello everyone, my name is ZHAO Mohan and I‚Äôm a year 1 student from the Global Entertainment program. If I choose three words to describe myself, it will be passionate, adaptable and open-minded. As I‚Äôm a Global Entertainment student, I‚Äôm really interested in the entertainment industry and want to work in this field in the future. And I think Hong Kong is a perfect place for me to connect with entertainment opportunities. At the same time, I think I‚Äôm adaptable. I‚Äôm good at adjusting to a new environment, and it‚Äôs an essential ability in the entertainment world. Finally, I try to stay open-minded so I can learn from different culture. I was born and raised in Hebei province, which is near Beijing, the capital of China. It‚Äôs easy for me to be exposed to the national affairs and learn how citizen can contribute to the country. In Hebei, we emphasis community a lot, so I realized this concept from a young age. And now, I came to Hong Kong for study, it‚Äôs a cross-regional, cross-cultural thing indeed deepen my understanding about global citizenship. However, we are not just citizens of our country, but also of the whole world. So it‚Äôs our responsibility to focus on how to make the world more sustainable, how to get the world more peaceful. It‚Äôs important for us to clear our mind that we are global citizen. It‚Äôs not just slogan, it‚Äôs more important to do something. For me, being a global citizen means rejecting discriminationÔºåliving more sustainable life and doing meaningful things in our daily life. Although they may be small, but the can be useful. Hope I can do my best and make the world more beautiful.
