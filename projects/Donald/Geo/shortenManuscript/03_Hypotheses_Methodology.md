## Hypotheses

To answer the research question — "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?" — here are three hypotheses.

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I believe that the noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD because the greater the distance from the CBD, the less accessible the area will be, so there will be fewer human activities and less noise will be created.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

Places away from the CBD will be less economically active, so people will be willing to spend less money to build the architecture. Therefore, the environmental quality will not be as good as those in the CBD.

3. The number of transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD

One of the characteristics of the CBD is high accessibility, which means that compared to the CBD, places away from it will be less accessible.

By testing these hypotheses, we will better understand the patterns of urban development in Hong Kong and gain valuable insights on urban planning and policy making with regard to transportation infrastructure, environmental protection and housing development.

Time: 9:00 – 15:00

| Method(s)               | types of data | how we did it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | why we did it                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | links to hypothesis                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Noise (DECIBELS)        | quantitative  | we opened the app (Fig 5.) that measures the noise level in decibels and walk and stayed in different point and add up all the data then divide them by the amount of members in the group and three because we stay in each points three times (1 min each time) | phone is not a professional device to measure noise level so we are spending more times and take the advantage of each sets of the data which is more accurate compared to use the raw data                                      | the data we received proves the hypothesis that the Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD                                               |
| ``EQS (rate/10)  | quantitative  | We filled in a survey that included the noise level, hygiene level, building quality, amount of litter, crowding, degree of attraction and facilities quality. And reserved a number between -21 to +21 points                                                    | there are many factors to decide the Environmental Quality of an area, though the survey, we would have a clue what is the environmental quality of the area we studied about, and reflexed in the most intuitive way — numbers | the rate/10 reduces while the area we studied went away from the CBD, which linked to the hypothesis that EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD |
| TRAFFIC OPTIONS (lines) | qualitative   | We walked approximately 30 meters, around the center point of the place we studded and marked down every single traffic options for publics                                                                                                                       | This is to show how accessible the area is, by judging how many traffic options are available nearby.                                                                                                                            | This links to the hypothesis of amount of transport options decreasing with distance from the CBD                                                      |
