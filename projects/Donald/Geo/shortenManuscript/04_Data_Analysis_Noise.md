Figure 6: Average noise levels (decibels) at different distances from Victoria Harbour along Nathan Road

### Characterization

In the noise level graph, we can see that the decibel numbers go up and down a lot, but there is still a downward trend overall. The slope is about -0.015, which supports our first hypothesis. We collected data from 30 different places along Nathan Road, and the noise levels range from 58 dB to 84 dB.

The loudest noise we measured was 84 dB at 250 meters from Victoria Harbour. The quietest place was 58 dB at 1650 meters away. There are several high points around 250m, 560m, 800m, and 1450m where the noise was about 75-77 dB. The low points were around 800m, 1000m, and 1250m where it was about 67-68 dB.

The blue dashed line in the graph shows the general trend. Even though the individual measurements are quite different from each other, the overall pattern shows that noise gets quieter as we move away from Victoria Harbour. This supports our hypothesis that noise levels decrease with distance from the CBD. There are some unusual readings like the very high one at 250m and the very low one at 1650m that don't follow the normal pattern.

### Interpretation

Peaks (high points):

There are high population density places like shops, restaurants, and bus stops. These places are usually crowded and people tend to be talking while being in these areas. And since there are lots of people, they will have to raise their volume. Other than human voices, as mentioned, there are loud vehicles like buses, trucks and cars driving by, really close to the pedestrian path, which also forms part of the noises.

Bottom points (low points):

Even though the population density overall is high in the area we study, there are still places like back alleys, less popular restaurants and restricted shops where less people visit. Which most likely having less vehicles pass over, that explained why their noise level decreased.

Anomalies (Usual Patterns):

The High Anomaly is possibly caused by the construction site, machinery will cause loud noises. Workers in the site have to wear suitable ear protections, following the instruction from Hong Kong Labour Department

The Low Anomaly is possibly caused by a remote street

#### Interpretation

High noise areas (peaks):

When we collected data in Nathan Road, we noticed human activities are the main source of noise. Among the noisiest places were  shopping areas like the ones in Tsim Sha Tsui, where many tourists and locals were talking loudly. Another really noisy place is bus stops because people have to speak louder when buses arrive. Restaurants and shops are also a source of noise pollution as music is played and air conditioning is on.

Not surprisingly, traffic remains the main cause for noise pollution. There are many buses and cars that drive across Nathan Road, making a lot of noise. The sound is louder when they stop or start moving, affecting pedestrians on the sidewalk. During our data collection, we identified a number of intersections that were particularly noisy because of all the vehicles.

Quiet areas (low points):

Nathan Road is well known for its hectic activities. Nevertheless, some quieter places were found, e.g. small side streets or areas between big buildings. We saw fewer people around these areas. Some older residential buildings were also quieter, probably because there were few shops on the ground floor. Overall, places tend to be less noisy when fewer cars drive by and less commercial activities are happening.

Unusual readings:

Some surprisingly high reading was noted at 250 m. In retrospect, we think a probable cause could be the construction work on that day. Excessive noise could come from all the drilling and machinery operating.

The reading at 1650m was unexpectedly low. This area seemed to have more residential buildings further from the main commercial district. so it makes sense that it would be quieter than other parts of Nathan Road.

## Revision Plan

### Priority 1: Remove Duplicate Interpretation Sections (Remove ~60 words)
1. **DELETE the second "Interpretation" section** - It repeats the same points as the first interpretation
2. **Keep only the first interpretation section** with Peaks/Bottom points/Anomalies structure
3. **Merge any unique points** from the second section into the first

### Priority 2: Condense Characterization (Remove ~25 words)
1. **Combine similar sentences** about data range and trends
2. **Remove redundant explanations** of the blue line
3. **Shorten specific data point descriptions**

### Priority 3: Streamline Interpretation Points (Remove ~15 words)
1. **Condense peak explanations** - Merge human activities and traffic sources
2. **Shorten bottom points description** - Focus on key reasons for quiet areas
3. **Simplify anomaly explanations** - Remove detailed construction site reference

### Target Structure (400 words):
- **Characterization**: 150 words
  - Overall trend description: 50 words
  - Key data points: 50 words
  - Pattern summary: 50 words
- **Interpretation**: 250 words
  - High points explanation: 100 words
  - Low points explanation: 75 words
  - Anomalies explanation: 75 words
- Figure remains (doesn't count toward word limit)

### Key Points to Preserve:
- Slope value (-0.015) supporting hypothesis
- Data range (58-84 dB)
- Key measurement locations and values
- Connection between noise sources and urban activities
- Traffic as main noise source
- Construction and residential area explanations

### Specific Cuts:
1. **REMOVE**: Entire duplicate interpretation section (paragraphs starting with "High noise areas (peaks)")
2. **REMOVE**: Redundant trend explanations
3. **REMOVE**: Excessive detail about specific locations
4. **KEEP**: Core data, trend analysis, and main noise source explanations
