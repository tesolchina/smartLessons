# Conclusion

This study investigated the change of urban characteristics with the distance to Victoria Harbour along the Nathan Road. To answer our research question, we applied three hypotheses concerning the noise levels, EQS and transportation options.

Hypothesis: The level of noise will reduce as one goes further away from the CBD. We were right in our first hypothesis. The statistics indicate that the levels of noise diminish with distance (slope = -0.015). We registered the loudest noise at 250m harbour at 84 dB and the lowest noise at 1650m at 58 dB. This justifies the Burgess model due to high traffic and business activities in the CBD which cause noise.

Hypothesis 2: EQS will be reduced with the distance to the CBD. This was a hypothesis that was hardly supported (slope = -0.005). There was much variation in EQS scores between -18 and +17. There were also good scores such as +14 at 1.1km which were distant to the harbour. This can imply that factors such as construction maintenance and cleanliness are local and are more valuable than a distance as far as Victoria Harbour.

Hypothesis 3: A distance between the CBD and transport options will be found to decrease. The third hypothesis was acceptable (slope = -0.0013). The travel choices were a maximum of 33-37 around MTR stations at 700-800m and 1600m. The lowest was almost 0 at 1800m. This indicates that the transport system in Hong Kong is structured around centres of big areas but not evenly distributed.

Overall Answer The features of the urban areas vary with the distance to Victoria Harbour not necessarily in a straightforward manner. The Burgess model is useful in explaining some of the trends, although the geographical peculiarity of Hong Kong and its excellent transport system are exceptions to normal urban models.

# Evaluation

## Positives of my study

For this study overall, the collection of data and the compilation of that data went very well. Firstly, the data collection was quite efficient with students split up into groups and spreading out to the different data collection sites along Nathan Road. Everyone had equal involvement in the tasks, which was quite good. We managed to cover a good distance of 1.8km from Victoria Harbour and took multiple readings at each location.

| The first problem with some of the data collection is that we were all using a phone app for the noise level data set, however not every phone will have the same set of microphones, and therefore some may be more sensitive, and some may filter out more excess noise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | To address the noise data issue, I believe it would be better for all of us to use standardised equipment, such as a proper decibel meter, this can eliminate the variations caused by the difference in microphones used. |

| Additionally, the EQS scoring was quite subjective and different team members sometimes gave different scores for the same area, which could affect our results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | For the EQS scoring, we could have clearer criteria for each category and maybe take photos to review later, this would make our scoring more consistent and reliable.                                                     |
| The weather wasn't ideal during data collection - it was quite windy which probably affected our noise readings when the wind hit the phone microphones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | For the issue with the weather, simply waiting a few days for the weather to clear up would possibly make the investigation better and give more accurate noise measurements.                                              |
| We only collected data on one day during school hours, so we don't know if the patterns would be the same at different times or on weekends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | If we had more time, collecting data over multiple days and different times would show whether our findings are consistent and representative of normal conditions.                                                        |
