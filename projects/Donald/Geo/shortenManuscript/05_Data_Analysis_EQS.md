Figure 7. Environmental Quality Survey (EQS) scores along a transect extending inland from Victoria Harbour

### Characterization

As can be seen in Figure 7, the EQS scores show great spatial variability across the 2 km transect from Victoria Harbour. A weak negative correlation is observed (regression slope = -0.005), suggesting a slight decrease in environmental quality with distance. This overall statistical trend supports the second hypothesis regarding the distance-quality relationship. The range of scores spans from -18 to +17, indicating considerable variation in environmental conditions.

Primary peaks are identified at 0.9 km (+12 points), 1.1 km (+14 points), and 1.8 km (+12 points) from Victoria Harbour. Secondary elevated scores are recorded at approximately 0.6 km, 0.7 km, and 1.7 km, with values ranging from +5 to +8 points. The positive scores suggest above-average environmental conditions at these locations. Conversely, significant negative valleys occur at 0.8 km (-8 points), 1.4 km (-17 points, representing the lowest recorded value), 1.5 km (-10 points), and 1.6 km (-9 points). The distribution pattern indicates the absence of clear proximity-based clustering near the harbour, with both high and low quality areas distributed throughout the transect.  Despite the variability found in the individual data points, the overall downward trend suggests that the environmental quality has the tendency to decline with the increasing distance from Victoria Harbour. Nevertheless, the weak correlation coefficient implies that local factors play a more important role than distance in influencing environmental quality.

### Interpretation

Peaks (high points)

In every probability, the areas that contain high EQS are the ones that are near the main road or the visitor places that possess fancy constructions that lead to high EQS. They are nice areas as they receive more attention and money is spent on ensuring that they are clean and appealing. These may be tourist attractions or shopping streets.

Bottom points (low points):

The kind of locations that tend to be associated with low EQS can be deduced from the fact that the buildings in the vicinity are ancient, in disrepairs and not well managed. However, due to the building demand in Hong Kong, those low points would not even drop to the rank of really bad anomalies. It is even as far as they are worse places as it cannot be too bad because the government has laws on maintaining buildings in a safe and decent condition.

Anomalies (Unusual Patterns):

High Anomalies: It may include luxury boutiques or restaurants with furniture that is too unusual to an extent that EQS score spikes. But it is these stores in virtually every instance, which are located in the shopping centers of the high-end shopping centers and not on the street, which becomes an exception as they become fancier than the ordinary places on the street.

Low Anomalies: There can be graffiti on a building or a litter-filled street that has not been cleaned yet and this has an effect on the appearance of the street. As the EQS is rather subjective, and such cases are not common in Hong Kong, they also cause anomalies. The very low score of 1.4 km is likely to be one of these peculiar problem areas.

Overall Pattern:

As it has been proved, the farther one is located away from Victoria Harbour, the less attractive the area is. In closer proximity such aspects as the amount of resources being spent on maintenance, the type of buildings found in the area and the degree of the area's management are significantly more crucial than the mere distance to water.

## Revision Plan

### Priority 1: Condense Characterization Section (Remove ~50 words)
1. **Combine data point descriptions** - Merge primary and secondary peaks into one sentence
2. **Simplify statistical explanation** - Remove redundant correlation discussions
3. **Reduce specific location details** - Keep key values but remove excessive precision

### Priority 2: Streamline Interpretation Explanations (Remove ~35 words)
1. **Condense high points explanation** - Remove redundant descriptions about fancy constructions
2. **Shorten low points description** - Remove complex building regulation explanation
3. **Simplify anomaly descriptions** - Focus on main causes without excessive detail

### Priority 3: Remove Redundant Analysis (Remove ~15 words)
1. **Eliminate repetitive statements** about distance relationships
2. **Remove overly complex explanations** 
3. **Tighten language** throughout section

### Target Structure (400 words):
- **Characterization**: 200 words
  - Overall trend and slope: 60 words
  - Data range and key points: 80 words
  - Pattern summary: 60 words
- **Interpretation**: 200 words

### Key Points to Preserve:
- Slope value (-0.005) and weak correlation
- Data range (-18 to +17)
- Key peak and valley locations
- Connection between EQS and building quality/maintenance
- Local factors vs distance influence
- Support for second hypothesis

### Specific Cuts:
1. **REMOVE**: Excessive location precision (e.g., "approximately 0.6 km, 0.7 km, and 1.7 km")
2. **REMOVE**: Complex building regulation explanations
3. **REMOVE**: Redundant correlation discussions
4. **REMOVE**: Overly detailed anomaly descriptions
5. **KEEP**: Core statistical findings and main environmental quality patterns
