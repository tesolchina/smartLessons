Graph showing the change of Traffic Options while the distance from Victoria Harbour increases

### Characterization

In the Traffic Option Counts graph, the blue dots are scattered all over the place, but there is still a slight downward trend shown by the red line. The equation is y = -0.0013x + 13.11, which means the slope is -0.0013. This supports my third hypothesis that traffic options decrease with distance.

The highest points on the graph are around 700-800 meters and 1600 meters from Victoria Harbour, where there are about 33-37 traffic options. The lowest point is at around 1800 meters, where there are almost no traffic options (close to 0).

Most of the dots are between 5-25 traffic options. There are some points that are much higher than the red trend line, like the ones at 700m, 800m, and 1600m. These are unusual because they have way more traffic options than expected. There are also some very low points at around 900m, 1400m, and 1800m that have less than 5 traffic options.

### Interpretation

High points (many traffic options):

The areas with the most traffic options (33-37 options) are probably where major MTR stations or transport hubs are located. At around 700-800 meters, this could be near Tsim Sha Tsui or Jordan stations, which are very busy areas with lots of buses, taxis, and MTR lines. The high point at 1600 meters might be another major station like Prince Edward or Mong Kok, which also have many transport connections.

Low points (few traffic options):

The areas with very few traffic options (0-5 options) are probably in between the major stations or in less developed areas. These places might only have a few bus routes and no MTR stations nearby. People living here would have to walk further to find good transportation.

Unusual patterns (anomalies):

The very high points that are above the trend line show that even though we're moving away from Victoria Harbour, some places still have excellent transport connections. This happens because Hong Kong's transport system is built around major stations that serve as hubs, not just distance from the harbour.

The very low points show that some areas are really poorly connected, which makes sense because not every street can have a station or many bus stops.

This data supports my hypothesis that transport options generally decrease with distance from Victoria Harbour, but there are some exceptions where major transport hubs create areas with lots of options even when they're far from the CBD.

## Revision Plan

### Priority 1: Condense Characterization Section (Remove ~40 words)
1. **Simplify data scatter description** - Remove "scattered all over the place"
2. **Combine data point descriptions** - Merge highest and lowest point explanations
3. **Remove redundant trend explanations** - Streamline slope and equation description

### Priority 2: Streamline Interpretation Points (Remove ~45 words)
1. **Condense high points explanation** - Remove specific station names and excessive detail
2. **Shorten low points description** - Focus on main concept without repetitive explanations
3. **Simplify anomaly descriptions** - Remove redundant explanations about hub systems

### Priority 3: Remove Final Summary (Remove ~15 words)
1. **Remove concluding paragraph** - The data-hypothesis connection is already clear
2. **Eliminate repetitive statements** about distance patterns

### Target Structure (300 words):
- **Characterization**: 120 words
  - Trend description and slope: 40 words
  - Key data points: 50 words
  - Data distribution: 30 words
- **Interpretation**: 180 words
  - High points explanation: 70 words
  - Low points explanation: 50 words
  - Anomalies explanation: 60 words
- Figure remains (doesn't count toward word limit)

### Key Points to Preserve:
- Slope value (-0.0013) supporting hypothesis
- Data range (0-37 options)
- Key peak locations (700-800m, 1600m)
- Connection to MTR stations and transport hubs
- Hub-based transport system explanation
- Support for third hypothesis

### Specific Cuts:
1. **REMOVE**: Excessive scatter plot description
2. **REMOVE**: Specific station names (Tsim Sha Tsui, Jordan, Prince Edward, Mong Kok)
3. **REMOVE**: Redundant explanations about walking distances
4. **REMOVE**: Final concluding paragraph
5. **KEEP**: Core statistical findings and transport hub concept
