Burgess model (Fig4) also known as the concentric ring model, is a model showing the development of cities and separating them into different areas including Central Business(CBD), Factories/ Industries, working class housing, middle class housing, and commuter zone. The burgess model was designed in the 1920s, based on Chicago ,with the CBDs situated at the centre of the city, slowly extending outwards with the medium-class and low-class residential zones.

The model is relevant and suitable to the present study as it explores how urban characteristics change with distance from the city centre following specific patterns. The basic principle of the model is that urban intensity declines with the increasing distance from CBD, generating gradients in economic activities, population density and infrastructure quality that are predictable.  Not surprisingly, higher noise levels are typically experienced in locations closer to the CBD thanks to more concentrated traffic and business activities. People near the CBD also enjoy a better environment and more transportation options. The general theoretical principles offer a framework for better understanding how the urban characteristics vary along Nathan Road as people move away from Victoria Harbour.

The Burgess model identifies various urban zones, each with varying characteristic patterns of noise, environmental quality, and accessibility. At the center, the CBD is the most convenient place of the city where people can easily access the office buildings and business activities from almost anywhere. As a result, we observe the highest concentration of transportation options and economic activity. Moving outward, one can find the industrial zone as industries rely on inexpensive land near the center for easy transport. This is an area with higher noise levels from factories and run-down, older buildings with lower environmental quality. According to the model, people living in the working class housing zone experience moderate noise and environmental conditions as they live near the factories or areas with higher density housing. The middle class zone, on the other hand, provides lower density, more beautiful environment, and better security and lower noise level. The outermost commuter zone attracts people who prefer a quieter environment. According to the model, transportation options will decrease as we move away from CBD just like noise level and environmental quality, in line with the hypotheses of this study.

Nevertheless, since Hong Kong has many uneven, mountainous areas, the Burgess model has to be adapted before it can be applied in our study. Since the adoption of open door policy in Mainland China, Hong Kong has developed its financial sector and become a world financial centre. With more people living in the New Territories to commute to the CBDs, the government has gradually built an extensive public transportation system composed of underground railway (MTR), buses, public light buses and ferries. However, the housing prices have also increased significantly in the areas with good transport access.  These patterns led to differences in access to transportation- some areas near the harbour feature more options while areas further away with fewer choices. These patterns in Hong Kong along roads like Nathan Road enable us to focus on this area to investigate how urban characteristics change as we move away from CBDs.

## Revision Plan (MAJOR CUTS NEEDED)

### Priority 1: Remove Detailed Zone Descriptions (Remove ~180 words)
1. **DELETE entire third paragraph** - Detailed descriptions of CBD, industrial, working class, middle class, and commuter zones
2. **Remove specific zone characteristics** - Factory descriptions, housing quality details, security mentions

### Priority 2: Remove Hong Kong Adaptation Section (Remove ~50 words)
1. **DELETE most of final paragraph** - Open door policy reference, financial center development, New Territories commuting
2. **Keep only connection to Nathan Road study** - Final sentence about transportation patterns

### Priority 3: Streamline Core Explanation (Remove ~20 words)
1. **Condense model definition** - Remove redundant descriptions
2. **Simplify relevance explanation** - Focus on distance-based patterns only
3. **Remove repetitive phrases** throughout

### Target Structure (200 words):
- **Model Definition**: 60 words (Basic Burgess model concept and zones)
- **Core Principle**: 80 words (Distance-decay principle, relevance to noise/EQS/transport)
- **Study Application**: 60 words (How it applies to Nathan Road and Victoria Harbour)
- Figure remains (doesn't count toward word limit)

### Key Points to Preserve:
- Basic Burgess model definition
- Concentric ring concept
- Distance-decay principle (urban intensity declines with distance)
- Connection to noise, environmental quality, and transportation
- Relevance to current study
- Framework for understanding Nathan Road patterns

### Specific Cuts:
1. **REMOVE**: All detailed zone descriptions (CBD activities, industrial characteristics, housing types)
2. **REMOVE**: Hong Kong historical context (open door policy, financial development)
3. **REMOVE**: Specific transportation system details (MTR, buses, ferries)
4. **KEEP**: Basic model concept and its relevance to the three study variables
