Traffic Option Counts

![]()

Graph indicating how the options available to you in terms of traffic changes, the further away you are to Victoria Harbour.

Characterization

This is because the dots in the graph are scattered and the trend is seen to go down a bit as indicated by the red line. The formula of the line is y = -0.0013x +13.11, which implies that the slope of the line is -0.0013. That confirms my third conjecture: the farther the distance the lower the traffic choices.

The largest numbers are about 700800m and 1600m away at the harbour with 3337 choices. You have little choice (you are nearly at zero) at approximately 1800m.

Most spots have 5â€“25 options. There are points that soar far over the trend line such as 700 m, 800 m and 1600 m. They are strange since they have much more options than anticipated. You also have those lower with less than 5 options at 900m, 1400m and 1800m.

Interpretation

High traffic option areas:

In places with a variety of options (33 to 37), chances are that there is a large MTR station. It is likely that at around 700800 m there are busy stations that have numerous buses, taxis, and MTR lines. The other hot spot may be the 1600m location which may include numerous transport connections.

Low traffic option areas:

Locations with limited options (0 5) are likely to be between big stations or less developed areas. The bus route and MTR stops are not many and thus individuals would have to walk more in order to access good transportation.

Unusual patterns:

There are the truly high points proving that good transport connections can still exist even when one is miles away Victoria Harbour. The system of Hong Kong is designed such that big stations serve numerous routes. Low scores on the other hand imply that there are not all areas that are well connected which is understandable as not all streets can have their own stations or a great number of bus stops.
