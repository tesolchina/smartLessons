# Introduction

## Location of Study

Hong Kong is situated in the south of China and it forms a part of the Greater Bay Area. Victoria harbour refers to the water body situated between the kowloon peninsula and the Hong Kong Island which is the location of the two major business districts. This is a significant area in the development of cities and the issues that they encounter having a lot of people living together.

Hong Kong emerged as a big financial center which brought about issues in the city. The city boasts of some of the highest population concentrations in the world and there are high numbers of people in the New Territories who work in the city centre. This renders transport to be of high significance. Another issue that has been posed by rapid urban development is noise and environmental pollution. These problems pose the question of how various sections of the city become different when you are not within the harbor.

This paper examines three primary urban characteristics which include noise level, Environmental Quality Score (EQS) and the transportation choices. We would like to answer: How do the urban characteristics vary with distance to Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong? Nathan road was selected as it is used to access other parts of the city that are far and hence suitable in this investigation.

## Background Theory

Fig 4. A picture of burgess model

The concentric ring model is also referred to as the Burgess model. It depicts the way cities are built around the center in circles. The model contains various localities such as the Central Business District (CBD), industries, housing of working classes, housing of the middle classes, and the commuter zones. Ernest Burgess created this model in 1920s using Chicago as the basis.

This model is applicable in our study since it describes the way in which urban attributes vary as you go out of the city center. The point is that the more an area is distant to the CBD, the weaker the urban activity is. This produces tendencies in business operations, population density and quality of infrastructure that we could foresee.

The closer to the CBD places, the more noise there is as a result of increased traffic and business. The environment and transportation options are also better among people around the CBD. The theory assists us to appreciate how things evolve along Nathan road as we go farther off the Victoria Harbour.

Nonetheless, Hong Kong is not the same as Chicago since it has mountains and water all over. With Hong Kong being opened up economically, it became a financial centre of the world. The government developed a good means of transportation comprising MTR, buses, and ferries. However, the prices of houses increased enormously in locations that had excellent transport networks. This is the reason why we can research on Nathan Road to observe the urban nature as we go farther away form the harbor.

## Hypotheses

To answer our research question "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?", I made three hypotheses:

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I think noise will get quieter when you move away from the CBD because there will be fewer people and less activity, so less noise will be made.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

Places away from the CBD will have less business activity, so people won't spend as much money on building nice architecture. The environmental quality won't be as good as in the CBD.

3. The number of transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD

The CBD has high accessibility, which means places further away will be less accessible and have fewer transport options.

These hypotheses will help us understand urban development patterns in Hong Kong.

# Methodology

Date: 11th of June 2025
Time: 9:00 â€“ 15:00

| Method | Data Type | How we did it | Why we did it | Links to hypothesis |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Noise (DECIBELS) | quantitative | We used an app to measure noise levels in decibels. We stayed at different points and took the average of three readings (1 minute each) from all group members. | We took multiple readings to get more accurate data since phone apps aren't professional equipment. | This data tests if noise levels decrease with distance from the CBD |
| EQS (rate/10) | quantitative | We filled in a survey about noise level, hygiene, building quality, litter, crowding, attractiveness and facilities. We gave scores between -21 to +21 points. | There are many factors that decide environmental quality. The survey gives us a number to show the environmental quality of each area. | This tests if EQS decreases with distance from the CBD |
| TRAFFIC OPTIONS | qualitative | We walked about 30 meters around each study point and wrote down every public transport option available. | This shows how accessible each area is by counting transport options nearby. | This tests if transport options decrease with distance from the CBD |

# Data Presentation & Analysis

## Noise Level Records

![]()

Figure 6: Noise levels (decibels) in various distances around Victoria harbour along the Nathan Road.

### Characterization

The noise level data shows values between 58-84 dB with an overall downward trend (slope = -0.015), supporting our first hypothesis. The highest noise (84 dB) was at 250m near Victoria harbour, while the quietest (58 dB) was at 1650m distance. Although individual measurements varied, the general pattern shows noise decreases with distance from the harbour.

### Interpretation

High noise areas typically contain busy places like shops, restaurants and bus stops with many people and vehicles. Quieter areas are back alleys or residential buildings with fewer shops. The high reading at 250m was likely due to construction work, while the low reading at 1650m reflects the residential nature of that area.

Our data shows that human activities and traffic are the main noise sources, with bus stops and shopping areas being loudest.

## EQS Scores

Figure 7. Transect Survey (EQS) scores inland of Victoria Harbour.

### Characterization

The EQS scores vary greatly over 2km with a weakly negative correlation (slope = -0.005). This slightly supports our second hypothesis. Scores range from -18 to +17 points. The highest scores (+12 to +14) were at 0.9km, 1.1km and 1.8km, while the lowest (-17) was at 1.4km.

Good and bad quality areas are distributed throughout the route, showing that local factors matter more than distance from the harbour.

### Interpretation

High EQS areas tend to be main roads or tourist locations with nice buildings that receive more attention and funding. Low EQS areas have older buildings in poorer condition. The very low score at 1.4km might be an area with graffiti or poor maintenance.

Overall, building quality and local management are more important factors than distance from the harbour.

## Traffic Option Counts

### Characterization

The traffic option data shows a downward trend (slope = -0.0013), supporting our third hypothesis. The highest numbers (33-37 options) were at 700-800m and 1600m, while the lowest (near 0) was at 1800m. Most spots have 5-25 options.

### Interpretation

High traffic option areas likely contain major MTR stations with multiple bus routes. Low option areas are between stations or less developed areas. The high points show that good transport connections can exist far from Victoria Harbour, as Hong Kong's system centers on major stations.

# Conclusion

Hence the experiment on how material varies with distance off Victoria harbour on the Nathan Road. We have selected three speculations regarding noise, EQS, and transport choices.

Hypothesis 1: The closer one is to CBD, the lower the noise level. This one was spot on. The statistics depict a decrease in sound (slope = -0.015). The loudest reading of 84 dB was nearest to the harbour and the quietest 58 dB further away. It fits in the Burgess model as the CBD is full of traffic and noisy businesses.

Hypothesis 2: EQS tends to decline the further you are located away of the CBD. This conjecture received a poor nod (slope = -0.005). The EQS scores were going back and forth ranging between -18 and +17. There were other remote locations with good scores such as +14 at 1.1km. Local factors such as the state of a building in being kept clean are more important than proximity to the harbour.

Hypothesis 3: The further the distance between the CBD and the transport options, the lower. The following guess was supported (slope = -0.0013). The locations where the greatest number of options (33-37) were found were within MTR stations, and very few at 1800m. It demonstrates that the transport network of Hong Kong is not distributed evenly but centred on main stations.

The general response: It is not a linear response but urban characteristics do change as distance to Victoria harbour rises. The Burgess model has some explanations, but the geographical peculiarities of the city and the high transport system introduce a few wild cards.

# Evaluation

## What went well

Data gathering was easy since all were operating in groups in various locations in Nathan road. We all chipped in and in a short time, we had logged 1.8km with numerous readings of every locality.

## What could be improved

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Noise measurement phone applications were different in sensitivities | Use pro decibel meters to all measurements |
| EQS scoring was subjective between team members | Create clearer criteria and take photos for later review |
| Noise readings were messed up in windy weather | Wait till it is calm |
| Only collected data during school hours on one day only | Do it on several days at various times |
