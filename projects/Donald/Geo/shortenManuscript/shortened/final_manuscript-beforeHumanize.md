# Introduction

## Location of Study

Hong Kong is located in the south of China and is part of the Greater Bay Area. Victoria Harbour is the water area between Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island where the two main business districts are located. This area is important for understanding how cities develop and the problems they face with so many people living close together.

Hong Kong became a major financial center, but this created urban problems. The city has some of the highest population densities in the world, and many people live in the New Territories but work in the city center. This makes transportation very important. Fast urban growth has also caused problems with noise and environmental quality. These issues make us wonder how different parts of the city change when you move away from the harbor.

This study looks at three main urban features - noise levels, Environmental Quality Score (EQS), and transportation options. We want to answer: "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?" Nathan Road was chosen because it goes from the CBD to areas further away, making it good for this study.

## Background Theory

Fig 4. A picture of burgess model

The Burgess model is also called the concentric ring model. It shows how cities develop in circles around the center. The model has different areas like the Central Business District (CBD), factories, working class houses, middle class houses, and commuter areas. Ernest Burgess made this model in the 1920s based on Chicago.

This model is useful for our study because it explains how urban characteristics change when you move away from the city center. The main idea is that urban activity gets weaker as you go further from the CBD. This creates patterns in business activity, population density, and infrastructure quality that we can predict.

Places closer to the CBD usually have higher noise levels because there's more traffic and business activity. People near the CBD also have better environments and more transportation choices. This theory helps us understand how things change along Nathan Road as we move away from Victoria Harbour.

However, Hong Kong is different from Chicago because it has mountains and water everywhere. Since China opened up economically, Hong Kong became a world financial center. The government built a good public transportation system with MTR, buses, and ferries. But housing prices went up a lot in areas with good transport connections. This is why we can study Nathan Road to see how urban characteristics change as we move away from the harbor.

## Hypotheses

To answer our research question "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?", I made three hypotheses:

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I think noise will get quieter when you move away from the CBD because there will be fewer people and less activity, so less noise will be made.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

Places away from the CBD will have less business activity, so people won't spend as much money on building nice architecture. The environmental quality won't be as good as in the CBD.

3. The number of transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD

The CBD has high accessibility, which means places further away will be less accessible and have fewer transport options.

These hypotheses will help us understand urban development patterns in Hong Kong.

# Methodology

Date: 11th of June 2025
Time: 9:00 â€“ 15:00

| Method | Data Type | How we did it | Why we did it | Links to hypothesis |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Noise (DECIBELS) | quantitative | We used an app to measure noise levels in decibels. We stayed at different points and took the average of three readings (1 minute each) from all group members. | We took multiple readings to get more accurate data since phone apps aren't professional equipment. | This data tests if noise levels decrease with distance from the CBD |
| EQS (rate/10) | quantitative | We filled in a survey about noise level, hygiene, building quality, litter, crowding, attractiveness and facilities. We gave scores between -21 to +21 points. | There are many factors that decide environmental quality. The survey gives us a number to show the environmental quality of each area. | This tests if EQS decreases with distance from the CBD |
| TRAFFIC OPTIONS | qualitative | We walked about 30 meters around each study point and wrote down every public transport option available. | This shows how accessible each area is by counting transport options nearby. | This tests if transport options decrease with distance from the CBD |

# Data Presentation & Analysis

## Noise Level Records

Figure 6: Average noise levels (decibels) at different distances from Victoria Harbour along Nathan Road

### Characterization

Looking at the noise level graph, the decibel numbers go up and down quite a bit, but there's still a downward trend overall. The slope is -0.015, which supports our first hypothesis. We collected data from 30 different places along Nathan Road, and noise levels ranged from 58 dB to 84 dB.

The loudest noise was 84 dB at 250 meters from Victoria Harbour. The quietest place was 58 dB at 1650 meters away. There were several high points around 250m, 560m, 800m, and 1450m where noise was about 75-77 dB. The low points were around 800m, 1000m, and 1250m where it was about 67-68 dB.

The blue line in the graph shows the general pattern. Even though individual measurements were quite different, the overall trend shows noise gets quieter as we move away from Victoria Harbour. This supports our hypothesis that noise levels decrease with distance from the CBD.

### Interpretation

**High noise areas:**

Places with high noise levels usually have lots of people like shops, restaurants, and bus stops. These areas are crowded and people talk loudly. There are also many vehicles like buses, trucks and cars driving close to the sidewalk, which makes a lot of noise.

**Quiet areas:**

Even though Nathan Road is generally busy, there are some quieter spots like back alleys, less popular restaurants, and areas with fewer shops. These places have fewer people visiting and less traffic passing by, so the noise level is lower.

**Unusual readings:**

The very high reading at 250m was probably caused by construction work. Construction machinery makes very loud noises that can affect our measurements.

The low reading at 1650m was probably because this area has more residential buildings and is further from the main shopping areas, so it makes sense that it would be quieter than other parts of Nathan Road.

**Main findings:**

When we collected data on Nathan Road, we found that human activities and traffic are the main sources of noise. Shopping areas and bus stops were the noisiest because of crowds and vehicles. Traffic is the biggest cause of noise pollution, especially when buses and cars stop and start at intersections. Quieter areas were usually side streets or residential buildings with fewer shops on the ground floor.

## EQS Scores

### Characterization

Looking at Figure 7, the EQS scores show a lot of variation across the 2 km from Victoria Harbour. There's a weak negative correlation (slope = -0.005), which means environmental quality decreases slightly with distance. This supports our second hypothesis but not very strongly. The scores range from -18 to +17, showing big differences in environmental conditions.

The highest points are at 0.9 km (+12 points), 1.1 km (+14 points), and 1.8 km (+12 points) from Victoria Harbour. There are also good scores around 0.6 km, 0.7 km, and 1.7 km with values from +5 to +8 points. The lowest points are at 0.8 km (-8 points), 1.4 km (-17 points, the worst score), 1.5 km (-10 points), and 1.6 km (-9 points).

The pattern shows that good and bad quality areas are spread throughout the route, not just near the harbour. Even though individual scores vary a lot, there's still a slight downward trend as we move away from Victoria Harbour. However, the weak correlation means that local factors are more important than distance for environmental quality.

### Interpretation

**High EQS areas:**

Areas with high EQS scores are probably near main roads or tourist places with nice buildings. These areas get more attention and money is spent to keep them clean and attractive. They might be tourist attractions or shopping streets where the government and businesses want to make a good impression.

**Low EQS areas:**

Places with low EQS scores usually have old buildings that aren't well maintained. However, even the worst areas in Hong Kong aren't too bad because the government has laws about keeping buildings safe and decent.

**Unusual patterns:**

Some high scores might be luxury shops or restaurants that are much fancier than normal street-level places. Low scores could be areas with graffiti or streets that haven't been cleaned recently. The very low score at 1.4 km is probably one of these problem areas.

**Overall pattern:**

The further away from Victoria Harbour, the less attractive areas tend to be. But things like how much money is spent on maintenance and the type of buildings are more important than just distance from the water. Local management and building quality matter more than location.

## Traffic Option Counts

### Characterization

In the Traffic Option Counts graph, the dots are scattered but there's still a slight downward trend shown by the red line. The equation is y = -0.0013x + 13.11, which means the slope is -0.0013. This supports my third hypothesis that traffic options decrease with distance.

The highest points are around 700-800 meters and 1600 meters from Victoria Harbour, where there are about 33-37 traffic options. The lowest point is around 1800 meters, where there are almost no traffic options (close to 0).

Most places have between 5-25 traffic options. Some points are much higher than the trend line, like at 700m, 800m, and 1600m. These are unusual because they have way more options than expected. There are also low points around 900m, 1400m, and 1800m with less than 5 options.

### Interpretation

**High traffic option areas:**

Areas with the most traffic options (33-37) are probably where major MTR stations are located. Around 700-800 meters could be near busy stations with lots of buses, taxis, and MTR lines. The high point at 1600 meters might be another major station with many transport connections.

**Low traffic option areas:**

Areas with very few options (0-5) are probably between major stations or in less developed areas. These places might only have a few bus routes and no MTR stations nearby. People here would have to walk further to find good transportation.

**Unusual patterns:**

The very high points show that even when we're far from Victoria Harbour, some places still have excellent transport connections. This happens because Hong Kong's transport system is built around major stations that work as hubs.

The very low points show some areas are poorly connected, which makes sense because not every street can have stations or many bus stops.

# Conclusion

This study looked at how urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour along Nathan Road. We tested three hypotheses about noise levels, EQS, and transportation options.

**Hypothesis 1:** Noise levels will decrease with distance from the CBD. This hypothesis was correct. Our data shows noise levels go down with distance (slope = -0.015). We found the loudest noise was 84 dB near the harbour and the quietest was 58 dB further away. This supports the Burgess model because the CBD has more traffic and business activities that cause noise.

**Hypothesis 2:** EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD. This hypothesis was only weakly supported (slope = -0.005). There was a lot of variation in EQS scores from -18 to +17. Some areas far from the harbour had good scores like +14 at 1.1km. This means local factors like building maintenance and cleanliness are more important than distance from Victoria Harbour.

**Hypothesis 3:** Transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD. This hypothesis was supported (slope = -0.0013). The most transport options (33-37) were around MTR stations, and the fewest were almost 0 at 1800m. This shows Hong Kong's transport system is built around major stations rather than being evenly spread out.

**Overall answer:** Urban characteristics do change with distance from Victoria Harbour, but not in a simple way. The Burgess model helps explain some trends, but Hong Kong's unique geography and excellent transport system create exceptions to normal urban patterns.

# Evaluation

## What went well

Data collection was efficient with students working in groups at different sites along Nathan Road. Everyone participated equally and we covered a good distance of 1.8km with multiple readings at each location.

## What could be improved

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Phone apps for noise measurement had different sensitivities | Use professional decibel meters for all measurements |
| EQS scoring was subjective between team members | Create clearer criteria and take photos for later review |
| Windy weather affected noise readings | Wait for better weather conditions |
| Only collected data on one day during school hours | Collect data on multiple days and different times |
