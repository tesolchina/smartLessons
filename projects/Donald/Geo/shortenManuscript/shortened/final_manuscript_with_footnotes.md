# Introduction

## Location of Study

Hong Kong is situated in the south of China and it forms a part of the Greater Bay Area¹. Victoria harbour refers to the water body situated between the kowloon peninsula and the Hong Kong Island which is the location of the two major business districts. This is a significant area in the development of cities and the issues that they encounter having a lot of people living together.

Hong Kong emerged as a big financial center which brought about issues in the city. The city boasts of some of the highest population concentrations in the world² and there are high numbers of people in the New Territories who work in the city centre. This renders transport to be of high significance. Another issue that has been posed by rapid urban development is noise and environmental pollution. These problems pose the question of how various sections of the city become different when you are not within the harbor.

This paper examines three primary urban characteristics which include noise level, Environmental Quality Score (EQS) and the transportation choices. We would like to answer: How do the urban characteristics vary with distance to Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong? Nathan road was selected as it is used to access other parts of the city that are far and hence suitable in this investigation³.

## Background Theory

Fig 4. A picture of burgess model

The concentric ring model is also referred to as the Burgess model. It depicts the way cities are built around the center in circles. The model contains various localities such as the Central Business District (CBD), industries, housing of working classes, housing of the middle classes, and the commuter zones. Ernest Burgess created this model in 1920s using Chicago as the basis⁴.

This model is applicable in our study since it describes the way in which urban attributes vary as you go out of the city center. The point is that the more an area is distant to the CBD, the weaker the urban activity is. This produces tendencies in business operations, population density and quality of infrastructure that we could foresee.

The closer to the CBD places, the more noise there is as a result of increased traffic and business. The environment and transportation options are also better among people around the CBD. The theory assists us to appreciate how things evolve along Nathan road as we go farther off the Victoria Harbour.

Nonetheless, Hong Kong is not the same as Chicago since it has mountains and water all over. With Hong Kong being opened up economically, it became a financial centre of the world⁵. The government developed a good means of transportation comprising MTR, buses, and ferries. However, the prices of houses increased enormously in locations that had excellent transport networks⁶. This is the reason why we can research on Nathan Road to observe the urban nature as we go farther away form the harbor.

## Hypotheses

To answer our research question "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?", I made three hypotheses:

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I think noise will get quieter when you move away from the CBD because there will be fewer people and less activity, so less noise will be made.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

Places away from the CBD will have less business activity, so people won't spend as much money on building nice architecture. The environmental quality won't be as good as in the CBD.

3. The number of transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD

The CBD has high accessibility, which means places further away will be less accessible and have fewer transport options.

These hypotheses will help us understand urban development patterns in Hong Kong.

# Methodology

Date: 11th of June 2025
Time: 9:00 – 15:00

| Method | Data Type | How we did it | Why we did it | Links to hypothesis |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Noise (DECIBELS) | quantitative | We used an app to measure noise levels in decibels⁷. We stayed at different points and took the average of three readings (1 minute each) from all group members. | We took multiple readings to get more accurate data since phone apps aren't professional equipment. | This data tests if noise levels decrease with distance from the CBD |
| EQS (rate/10) | quantitative | We filled in a survey about noise level, hygiene, building quality, litter, crowding, attractiveness and facilities⁸. We gave scores between -21 to +21 points. | There are many factors that decide environmental quality. The survey gives us a number to show the environmental quality of each area. | This tests if EQS decreases with distance from the CBD |
| TRAFFIC OPTIONS | qualitative | We walked about 30 meters around each study point and wrote down every public transport option available. | This shows how accessible each area is by counting transport options nearby. | This tests if transport options decrease with distance from the CBD |

# Data Presentation & Analysis

## Noise Level Records

![]()

Figure 6: Noise levels (decibels) in various distances around Victoria harbour along the Nathan Road.

### Characterization

In the graph of noise level, the decibel values increase and decrease significantly, yet there is an overall downward trend in the graph. The slope = - 0.015 and this supports our first hypothesis. We had gathered information on 30 locations on the Nathan Road, and the decibels of noise were between 58 dB and 84 dB⁹.

The greatest noise of 84 dB was at 250 meters near Victoria harbour. The highest silence was 58 dB at 1650 meters distant. The high points were a few, about 250m, 560m, 800m and 1450m and were approximately 75-77 dB. The minimum was in the 800m, 1000m and 1250m where it was approximately 67-68 dB.

The general pattern is indicated in the blue line in the graph. Although the individual measurements were quite different, the total trend will be that the noise is less as we move away out of Victoria Harbour. This helps to prove our hypothesis that noise levels decline as one moves further away the CBD.

### Interpretation

**High noise areas:**

High noise places often contain a high number of people such as shops, restaurants and bus stops. There are so many people in these places and they speak loudly. Others include the numerous vehicles such as buses, trucks, cars that pass near the sidewalk and create a lot of noise¹⁰.

**Quiet areas:**

Although Nathan Road tends to be a busy place, one can find some of the quieter areas such as back alleys, non-peak restaurants and places with fewer shops. The number of people visiting such places is also low and the traffic is minimal and therefore the noise level is also low.

**Unusual readings:**

The result of reading at 250m was very high which was most likely due to construction works. The construction machineries produce very loud noises that may interfere with our measurements¹¹.

This was likely due to the low reading at 1650m, as there are more residential buildings located in this location, and it is more distant to the main shopping areas, so it would be natural to assume that the location would be free of noise compared to the rest of Nathan Road.

**Main findings:**

When we gathered data on the Nathan Road we discovered that the primary source of noise is human activities and traffic. The bus stops and shopping areas were the most noisy due to people and cars. The largest cause of noise pollution is on the road, particularly as buses and cars come and go at the intersection of the streets. The less noisy places were typically side streets or residential buildings having fewer shops at the entry level.

## EQS Scores

Figure 7. Transect Survey (EQS) scores inland of Victoria Harbour.

### Characterization

At the glance of the Figure 7, the EQS scores vary greatly over the 2 km of Victoria Harbour. The correlation between the two is weakly negative (slope = -0.005), indicating that environmental quality declines a small bit with distance. This is in support of our second hypothesis but not strongly. The scores are between -18 and +17 with large disparities in environmental conditions¹².

The topmost are 0.9 km (+12 points), 1.1 km (+14 points) and 1.8 km (+12 points) above Victoria Harbour. Good scores of +5 to +8 points are also present with around 0.6 km, 0.7 km and 1.7 km. Its lowest points are 0.8 km (-8 points), 1.4 km (-17 points, the worst score), 1.5 km (-10 points) and 1.6 km (-9 points).

It is indicated that good and bad quality areas are distributed all along the route, not only by the harbour. Although there is wide range of individual scores, there is a slight negative trend as we go farther away out of Victoria harbour. The correlation is however weak and therefore the local factors are of greater significance than distance in relation to environmental quality.

### Interpretation

**High EQS areas:**

The places with high EQS scores are likely to be close to main roads or tourist locations with pleasant constructions. These places receive an increased focus and funds are used to ensure that they are clean and presentable. They may be shopping streets or tourist attractions of which the government and the business would like to appear good¹³.

**Low EQS areas:**

Areas with low EQS scores tend to have aged buildings that are not in good condition. Nonetheless, even the least desirable places in Hong Kong are not that bad since the government has regulations regarding safe buildings and fair ones¹⁴.

**Unusual patterns:**

A few of the high scores may be luxury shops or restaurants that are far more fancy than the typical street-level ones. The areas with graffiti or the streets that are not cleaned recently could be low-scoring. One of these areas of problems is likely to be the very low score at 1.4 km.

**Overall pattern:**

The less attractive places are the more distant they are to Victoria harbour. However, such considerations as amount of money to spend on maintenance and type of buildings are more significant than mere distance to the water. The quality of the buildings and the local management are more important than locality.

## Traffic Option Counts

![]()

Graph indicating how the options available to you in terms of traffic changes, the further away you are to Victoria Harbour.

### Characterization

This is because the dots in the graph are scattered and the trend is seen to go down a bit as indicated by the red line. The formula of the line is y = -0.0013x +13.11, which implies that the slope of the line is -0.0013. That confirms my third conjecture: the farther the distance the lower the traffic choices¹⁵.

The largest numbers are about 700-800m and 1600m away at the harbour with 33-37 choices. You have little choice (you are nearly at zero) at approximately 1800m.

Most spots have 5–25 options. There are points that soar far over the trend line such as 700 m, 800 m and 1600 m. They are strange since they have much more options than anticipated. You also have those lower with less than 5 options at 900m, 1400m and 1800m.

### Interpretation

**High traffic option areas:**

In places with a variety of options (33 to 37), chances are that there is a large MTR station. It is likely that at around 700-800 m there are busy stations that have numerous buses, taxis, and MTR lines. The other hot spot may be the 1600m location which may include numerous transport connections¹⁶.

**Low traffic option areas:**

Locations with limited options (0-5) are likely to be between big stations or less developed areas. The bus route and MTR stops are not many and thus individuals would have to walk more in order to access good transportation.

**Unusual patterns:**

There are the truly high points proving that good transport connections can still exist even when one is miles away Victoria Harbour. The system of Hong Kong is designed such that big stations serve numerous routes. Low scores on the other hand imply that there are not all areas that are well connected which is understandable as not all streets can have their own stations or a great number of bus stops.

# Conclusion

Hence the experiment on how material varies with distance off Victoria harbour on the Nathan Road. We have selected three speculations regarding noise, EQS, and transport choices.

Hypothesis 1: The closer one is to CBD, the lower the noise level. This one was spot on. The statistics depict a decrease in sound (slope = -0.015). The loudest reading of 84 dB was nearest to the harbour and the quietest 58 dB further away. It fits in the Burgess model as the CBD is full of traffic and noisy businesses¹⁷.

Hypothesis 2: EQS tends to decline the further you are located away of the CBD. This conjecture received a poor nod (slope = -0.005). The EQS scores were going back and forth ranging between -18 and +17. There were other remote locations with good scores such as +14 at 1.1km. Local factors such as the state of a building in being kept clean are more important than proximity to the harbour.

Hypothesis 3: The further the distance between the CBD and the transport options, the lower. The following guess was supported (slope = -0.0013). The locations where the greatest number of options (33-37) were found were within MTR stations, and very few at 1800m. It demonstrates that the transport network of Hong Kong is not distributed evenly but centred on main stations¹⁸.

The general response: It is not a linear response but urban characteristics do change as distance to Victoria harbour rises. The Burgess model has some explanations, but the geographical peculiarities of the city and the high transport system introduce a few wild cards.

# Evaluation

## What went well

Data gathering was easy since all were operating in groups in various locations in Nathan road. We all chipped in and in a short time, we had logged 1.8km with numerous readings of every locality.

## What could be improved

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Noise measurement phone applications were different in sensitivities | Use pro decibel meters to all measurements |
| EQS scoring was subjective between team members | Create clearer criteria and take photos for later review |
| Noise readings were messed up in windy weather | Wait till it is calm |
| Only collected data during school hours on one day only | Do it on several days at various times |

## Footnotes

¹ The Greater Bay Area is a megacity cluster consisting of Hong Kong, Macau, and nine cities in Guangdong Province, aimed at creating an integrated economic region.

² Hong Kong has a population density of approximately 6,777 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the world.

³ Nathan Road, often called the "Golden Mile," is a major thoroughfare in Kowloon that extends from Tsim Sha Tsui to Boundary Street, making it ideal for studying urban gradients.

⁴ Ernest Burgess developed the concentric zone model in 1925 as part of the Chicago School of urban sociology, based on observations of Chicago's urban growth patterns.

⁵ Hong Kong's transformation into a global financial center accelerated after China's economic reforms in 1978, positioning it as a gateway between China and the international market.

⁶ The transport-oriented development in Hong Kong has led to property price premiums near MTR stations, often adding 10-15% to property values within 500 meters of stations.

⁷ The decibel scale is logarithmic, meaning that an increase of 10 dB represents a tenfold increase in sound intensity. Normal conversation is approximately 60 dB.

⁸ Environmental Quality Surveys typically assess multiple factors including air quality, noise pollution, visual pollution, building maintenance, and public space quality.

⁹ For reference, 58 dB is equivalent to moderate rainfall, while 84 dB is similar to city traffic or a garbage disposal unit.

¹⁰ Vehicle noise in urban areas typically ranges from 70-85 dB, with buses and trucks producing higher levels than cars due to their diesel engines and larger size.

¹¹ Construction noise can reach 80-120 dB depending on the equipment used, with jackhammers and pile drivers being among the loudest construction activities.

¹² The wide variation in EQS scores reflects Hong Kong's diverse urban landscape, from modern commercial districts to older residential areas with varying maintenance standards.

¹³ Tourist areas in Hong Kong, such as Tsim Sha Tsui and Central, receive significant government investment in public space improvements and cleanliness maintenance.

¹⁴ Hong Kong's Buildings Ordinance and related regulations ensure minimum safety and maintenance standards, preventing the severe urban decay seen in some other cities.

¹⁵ The slight negative correlation suggests that while transport accessibility generally decreases with distance from the CBD, Hong Kong's comprehensive public transport network creates exceptions to this pattern.

¹⁶ Major MTR interchange stations like Mong Kok and Prince Edward serve as transport hubs with multiple rail lines and extensive bus networks, creating high accessibility nodes.

¹⁷ The relationship between noise and distance from CBD supports traditional urban models, where commercial and transport activities concentrate in central areas.

¹⁸ Hong Kong's public transport system follows a hub-and-spoke model centered on major MTR stations, rather than the grid-based systems found in some other cities.
