## Conclusion



Hence the experiment on how material varies with distance off Victoria harbour on the Nathan Road. We have selected three speculations regarding noise, EQS, and transport choices.



Hypothesis 1: The closer one is to CBD, the lower the noise level. This one was spot on. The statistics depict a decrease in sound (slope = -0.015). The loudest reading of 84 dB was nearest to the harbour and the quietest 58 dB further away. It fits in the Burgess model as the CBD is full of traffic and noisy businesses.



Hypothesis 2: EQS tends to decline the further you are located away of the CBD. This conjecture received a poor nod (slope = -0.005). The EQS scores were going back and forth ranging between -18 and +17. There were other remote locations with good scores such as +14 at 1.1km. Local factors such as the state of a building in being kept clean are more important than proximity to the harbour.



Hypothesis 3: The further the distance between the CBD and the transport options, the lower. The following guess was supported (slope = -0.0013). The locations where the greatest number of options (33-37) were found were within MTR stations, and very few at 1800m. It demonstrates that the transport network of Hong Kong is not distributed evenly but centred on main stations.



The general response: It is not a linear response but urban characteristics do change as distance to Victoria harbour rises. The Burgess model has some explanations, but the geographical peculiarities of the city and the high transport system introduce a few wild cards.



## Evaluation



**What went well:**

Data gathering was easy since all were operating in groups in various locations in Nathan road. We all chipped in and in a short time, we had logged 1.8km with numerous readings of every locality.



**What could be improved:**
