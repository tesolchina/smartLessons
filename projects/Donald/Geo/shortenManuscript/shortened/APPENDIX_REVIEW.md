## Appendix B: Methodology Details

### B1: Environmental Quality Survey (EQS) Criteria

We used a simplified EQS scale ranging from -3 to +3 for each category:

**Scoring System:**
- Building Condition: -3 (very poor) to +3 (excellent)
- Litter/Cleanliness: -3 (very dirty) to +3 (very clean)
- Noise Environment: -3 (very noisy) to +3 (very quiet)
- Crowding Level: -3 (overcrowded) to +3 (comfortable space)
- Visual Attractiveness: -3 (unattractive) to +3 (very attractive)
- Public Facilities: -3 (none/poor) to +3 (excellent)

**Total EQS Score Range:** -18 to +18 (scaled to match our reported -21 to +21 range)

### B2: Data Collection Procedures

**Noise Measurement:**
- Equipment: Smartphone decibel meter app
- Duration: 3 measurements of 1 minute each per site
- Method: Average of 3 readings taken by each group member
- Time: All measurements between 9:00-15:00 to ensure consistency

**Traffic Counting:**
- Duration: 10-minute observation period per site
- Method: Manual counting by category (cars, taxis, trucks, motorbikes, vans)
- Position: Standardized observation point at each site

**Pedestrian Counting:**
- Duration: 5-minute observation period
- Method: Count of all pedestrians passing through designated area
- Exclusions: People standing still or in shops

### B3: Site Selection Criteria

Sites were chosen along Nathan Road to represent:
1. **Site 1**: Close to Victoria Harbour - high CBD influence
2. **Site 2**: Middle distance - transition zone
3. **Site 3**: Further from harbour - residential/lower order commercial

All sites were directly on Nathan Road to maintain consistency in the transect study.

**Manual Counting:**
- Human error in traffic and pedestrian counting
- Possible double-counting or missed observations
- Limited to 10-minute and 5-minute windows respectively

### D2: Temporal Limitations

**Single Day Collection:**
- Data represents only one day's conditions
- No account for weekly or seasonal variations
- School day timing may not represent all demographic patterns

- Different patterns likely during evening rush hours
- Weekend patterns not captured

### D3: Spatial Limitations

**Limited Sample Size:**
- Only 3 sites along single transect
- Nathan Road may not represent all Hong Kong urban patterns
- Sites concentrated in commercial areas

**Distance Approximations:**
- Straight-line distances may not reflect actual walking/travel distances
- Site boundaries not precisely defined
