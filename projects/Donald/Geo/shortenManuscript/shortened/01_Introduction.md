## Location of Study

Hong Kong is situated in the south of China and it forms a part of the Greater Bay Area. Victoria harbour refers to the water body situated between the kowloon peninsula and the Hong Kong Island which is the location of the two major business districts. This is a significant area in the development of cities and the issues that they encounter having a lot of people living together.

Hong Kong emerged as a big financial center which brought about issues in the city. The city boasts of some of the highest population concentrations in the world and there are high numbers of people in the New Territories who work in the city centre. This renders transport to be of high significance. Another issue that has been posed by rapid urban development is noise and environmental pollution. These problems pose the question of how various sections of the city become different when you are not within the harbor.

This paper examines three primary urban characteristics which include noise level, Environmental Quality Score (EQS) and the transportation choices. We would like to answer: How do the urban characteristics vary with distance to Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong? Nathan road was selected as it is used to access other parts of the city that are far and hence suitable in this investigation.
