# Section 3: Hypotheses & Methodology (Shortened)

## Hypotheses

To answer our research question "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?", I made three hypotheses:

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I think noise will get quieter when you move away from the CBD because there will be fewer people and less activity, so less noise will be made.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

Places away from the CBD will have less business activity, so people won't spend as much money on building nice architecture. The environmental quality won't be as good as in the CBD.

3. The number of transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD

The CBD has high accessibility, which means places further away will be less accessible and have fewer transport options.

These hypotheses will help us understand urban development patterns in Hong Kong.

# Methodology

Date: 11th of June 2025
Time: 9:00 â€“ 15:00

| Method | Data Type | How we did it | Why we did it | Links to hypothesis |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Noise (DECIBELS) | quantitative | We used an app to measure noise levels in decibels. We stayed at different points and took the average of three readings (1 minute each) from all group members. | We took multiple readings to get more accurate data since phone apps aren't professional equipment. | This data tests if noise levels decrease with distance from the CBD |
| EQS (rate/10) | quantitative | We filled in a survey about noise level, hygiene, building quality, litter, crowding, attractiveness and facilities. We gave scores between -21 to +21 points. | There are many factors that decide environmental quality. The survey gives us a number to show the environmental quality of each area. | This tests if EQS decreases with distance from the CBD |
| TRAFFIC OPTIONS | qualitative | We walked about 30 meters around each study point and wrote down every public transport option available. | This shows how accessible each area is by counting transport options nearby. | This tests if transport options decrease with distance from the CBD |
