## Appendix C: Methodology

### Data Collection Protocol

**Study Design:**
- **Date**: 11th June 2025, 9:00-15:00
- **Groups**: 13 student groups
- **Sites**: 39 measurement points
- **Coverage**: Nathan Road corridor (225m - 1760m from Victoria Harbour)

**Measurement Methods:**

| Variable | Method | Equipment | Duration |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Noise Level | Smartphone decibel app | Various models (±5 dB accuracy) | 3 x 1-minute readings |
| EQS Score | Standardized survey | Paper forms (-21 to +21 scale) | 10 minutes per site |
| Traffic Count | Manual observation | Visual counting | 2-minute windows |
| Pedestrian Count | Manual observation | Visual counting | 5-minute windows |
| Distance | Digital measurement | Google Maps | Straight-line to Victoria Harbour |

### Quality Control

**Standardization Measures:**
- Common data collection time window (6 hours)
- Standardized measurement protocols across all groups
- Weather conditions: Partly cloudy, 28°C, light breeze
- Cross-validation between nearby groups where possible

**Known Limitations:**
- Equipment variation between groups (different smartphone models)
- Single-day temporal snapshot
- Subjective EQS scoring differences between groups
- Manual counting potential for human error

## Appendix D: Data Files

**Complete datasets available:**
- `YR 10 DATA-complete.xlsx` - Original compilation (all 13 groups)
- `cleaned/cleaned_wide.csv` - Processed wide format (39 observations)
- `cleaned/cleaned_long.csv` - Processed long format (439 variables)

**Data Processing:**
- Missing value identification and treatment
- EQS score standardization across groups
- Distance measurement verification
- Traffic count aggregation and validation
