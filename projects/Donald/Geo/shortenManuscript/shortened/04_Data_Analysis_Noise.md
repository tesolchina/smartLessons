Figure 6: Noise levels (decibels) in various distances around Victoria harbour along the Nathan Road.

### Characterization

In the graph of noise level, the decibel values increase and decrease significantly, yet there is an overall downward trend in the graph. The slope = - 0.015 and this supports our first hypothesis. We had gathered information on 30 locations on the Nathan Road, and the decibels of noise were between 58 dB and 84 dB.

The greatest noise of 84 dB was at 250 meters near Victoria harbour. The highest silence was 58 dB at 1650 meters distant. The high points were a few, about 250m, 560m, 800m and 1450m and were approximately 75-77 dB. The minimum was in the 800m, 1000m and 1250m where it was approximately 67-68 dB.

The general pattern is indicated in the blue line in the graph. Although the individual measurements were quite different, the total trend will be that the noise is less as we move away out of Victoria Harbour. This helps to prove our hypothesis that noise levels decline as one moves further away the CBD.

### Interpretation

**High noise areas:**

High noise places often contain a high number of people such as shops, restaurants and bus stops. There are so many people in these places and they speak loudly. Others include the numerous vehicles such as buses, trucks, cars that pass near the sidewalk and create a lot of noise.

**Quiet areas:**

Although Nathan Road tends to be a busy place, one can find some of the quieter areas such as back alleys, non-peak restaurants and places with fewer shops. The number of people visiting such places is also low and the traffic is minimal and therefore the noise level is also low.

**Unusual readings:**

The result of reading at 250m was very high which was most likely due to construction works. The construction machineries produce very loud noises that may interfere with our measurements.

This was likely due to the low reading at 1650m, as there are more residential buildings located in this location, and it is more distant to the main shopping areas, so it would be natural to assume that the location would be free of noise compared to the rest of Nathan Road.

**Main findings:**

When we gathered data on the Nathan Road we discovered that the primary source of noise is human activities and traffic. The bus stops and shopping areas were the most noisy due to people and cars. The largest cause of noise pollution is on the road, particularly as buses and cars come and go at the intersection of the streets. The less noisy places were typically side streets or residential buildings having fewer shops at the entry level.
