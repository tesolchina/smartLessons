Fig 4. A picture of burgess model


The concentric ring model is also referred to as the Burgess model. It depicts the way cities are built around the center in circles. The model contains various localities such as the Central Business District (CBD), industries, housing of working classes, housing of the middle classes, and the commuter zones. Ernest Burgess created this model in 1920s using Chicago as the basis.

This model is applicable in our study since it describes the way in which urban attributes vary as you go out of the city center. The point is that the more an area is distant to the CBD, the weaker the urban activity is. This produces tendencies in business operations, population density and quality of infrastructure that we could foresee.

The closer to the CBD places, the more noise there is as a result of increased traffic and business. The environment and transportation options are also better among people around the CBD. The theory assists us to appreciate how things evolve along Nathan road as we go farther off the Victoria Harbour.

Nonetheless, Hong Kong is not the same as Chicago since it has mountains and water all over. With Hong Kong being opened up economically, it became a financial centre of the world. The government developed a good means of transportation comprising MTR, buses, and ferries. However, the prices of houses increased enormously in locations that had excellent transport networks. This is the reason why we can research on Nathan Road to observe the urban nature as we go farther away form the harbor.
