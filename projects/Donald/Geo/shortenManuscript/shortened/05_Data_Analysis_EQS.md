## EQS Scores

Figure 7. Transect Survey (EQS) scores inland of Victoria Harbour.

### Characterization

At the glance of the Figure 7, the EQS scores vary greatly over the 2 km of Victoria Harbour. The correlation between the two is weakly negative (slope = -0.005), indicating that environmental quality declines a small bit with distance. This is in support of our second hypothesis but not strongly. The scores are between -18 and +17 with large disparities in environmental conditions.

The topmost are 0.9 km (+12 points), 1.1 km (+14 points) and 1.8 km (+12 points) above Victoria Harbour. Good scores of +5 to +8 points are also present with around 0.6 km, 0.7 km and 1.7 km. Its lowest points are 0.8 km (-8 points), 1.4 km (-17 points, the worst score), 1.5 km (-10 points) and 1.6 km (-9 points).

It is indicated that good and bad quality areas are distributed all along the route, not only by the harbour. Although there is wide range of individual scores, there is a slight negative trend as we go farther away out of Victoria harbour. The correlation is however weak and therefore the local factors are of greater significance than distance in relation to environmental quality.

### Interpretation

**High EQS areas:**

The places with high EQS scores are likely to be close to main roads or tourist locations with pleasant constructions. These places receive an increased focus and funds are used to ensure that they are clean and presentable. They may be shopping streets or tourist attractions of which the government and the business would like to appear good.

**Low EQS areas:**

Areas with low EQS scores tend to have aged buildings that are not in good condition. Nonetheless, even the least desirable places in Hong Kong are not that bad since the government has regulations regarding safe buildings and fair ones.

**Unusual patterns:**

A few of the high scores may be luxury shops or restaurants that are far more fancy than the typical street-level ones. The areas with graffiti or the streets that are not cleaned recently could be low-scoring. One of these areas of problems is likely to be the very low score at 1.4 km.

**Overall pattern:**

The less attractive places are the more distant they are to Victoria harbour. However, such considerations as amount of money to spend on maintenance and type of buildings are more significant than mere distance to the water. The quality of the buildings and the local management are more important than locality.
