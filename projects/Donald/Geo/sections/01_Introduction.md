## Location of Study

Located in the south of People's Republic of China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a city in the Greater Bay Area bordering Shenzhen (Fig.1) and connected to Zhuhai and Macau via the Hong Kong-Zhuahi-Macau bridge.  Named after Queen Victoria in the 19th century, Victoria Harbour underwent the evolution from a fishing area into Asia's most hectic ports. Today it connects Kowloon Peninsular and Hong Kong Island (Fig. 2), where two main Central Business Districts (CBDs) are located. Studying this area is central to understanding the urban characteristics and challenges of the city's high-density development.

As it evolved into a global financial centre, Hong Kong also face considerable urban challenges. Given its population densities that was among the world's highest and with many people moving to the New Territories, access to the CBD through transportation networks has become a critical issue. Rapid urbanisation has raised concerns about noise pollution and environmental quality.  These challenges raised important questions about how the landscape of the city and its key characteristics vary across different distances from CBD.

In this study, we focus on three key urban characteristics—noise levels, Environmental Quality Score (EQS), and transportation options—and explore how they change with distance from the harbour to answer the research question: "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?" This investigation tests three hypotheses about these characteristics. To investigate the patterns, Nathan Road in the Yau Tsim Mong district was selected as the focus as the road connects the CBD of Kowloon to more distant areas (Fig. 3), offering a good case study for answering the research question.

Burgess model (Fig4) also known as the concentric ring model, is a model showing the development of cities and separating them into different areas including Central Business(CBD), Factories/ Industries, working class housing, middle class housing, and commuter zone. The burgess model is designed in the 1920s, based on Chicago ,with the CBDs situated at the centre of the city, slowly extending outwards with the medium-class and low-class residential zones.

The model is relevant and suitable to the present study as it explores how urban characteristics change with distance from the city centre following specific patterns. The basic principle of the model is that urban intensity declines with the increasing distance from CBD, generating gradients in economic activities, population density and infrastructure quality that are predictable.  Not surprisingly, higher noise level is typically experiences in locations closer to the CBD thanks to more concentrated traffic and business activities. People near the CBD also enjoy better environment and more transportation options. The general theoretical principles offers a framework for better understanding how the urban characteristics vary along Nathan Road as people moved away from Victoria Harbour.

The Burgess model identifies various urban zones, each with varying characteristic patterns of noise, environmental quality, and accessibility. At the center, the CBD is the most convenient place of the city where people can easily access the office buildings and business activities from almost anywhere. As a result, we observe highest concentration of transportation options and economic activity. Moving outward, one can find the industrial zone as industries rely on inexpensive land near the center for easy transport. This is an area with higher noise levels from factories and run-down, older buildings with lower environmental quality. According to the model, people living in the working class housing zone experiences moderate noise and environmental conditions as they live near the factories or areas with higher density housing. The middle class zone, on the other hand, provides lower density, more beautiful environment, and better security and lower noise level. The outermost commuter zone attracts people who prefer quieter environment. According to the model, transportation options will decrease as we move away from CBD just like noise level and environmental quality, in line with the hypotheses of this study.

Nevertheless, since Hong Kong has many uneven, mountainous areas, the Burgess model has to be adapted before it can be applied in our study. Since the adoption of open door policy in Mainland China, Hong Kong has developed its financial sector and become a world financial centre. With more people living in the New Territories to commute to the CBDs, the government has gradually built an extensive public transportation system composed of underground railway (MTR), buses, public light buses and ferries. However, the housing prices have also increased significantly in the areas with good transport access.  These patterns led to differences in access to transportation- some areas near the harbour feature more options while areas further away with fewer choices. These patterns in Hong Kong along roads like Nathan Road enable us to focus on this area to investigate how urban characteristics change as we move away from CBDs.

## Hypotheses

To answer the research question — "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?" — here are three hypotheses.

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I believe that the noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD because the greater the distance from the CBD, the less accessible the area will be, so there will be fewer human activities and less noise will be created.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

Places away from the CBD will be less economically active, so people will be willing to spend less money to build the architecture. Therefore, the environmental quality will not be as good as those in the CBD.

3. The number of transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD

One of the characteristics of the CBD is high accessibility, which means that compared to the CBD, places away from it will be less accessible.

By testing these hypotheses, we will better understand the patterns of urban development in Hong Kong and gain valuable insights on urban planning and policy making with regard to transportation infrastructure, environmental protection and housing development.
