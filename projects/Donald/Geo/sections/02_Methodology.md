| Method(s)               | types of data | how we did it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | why we did it                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | links to hypothesis                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Noise (DECIBELS)        | quantitative  | we opened the app (Fig 5.) that measures the noise level in decibels and walk and stayed in different point and add up all the data then divide them by the amount of members in the group and three because we stay in each points three times (1 min each time) | phone is not a professional device to measure noise level so we are spending more times and take the advantage of each sets of the data which is more accurate compared to use the raw data                                      | the data we received proves the hypothesis that the Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD                                               |
| ``EQS (rate/10)  | quantitative  | We filled in a survey that included the noise level, hygiene level, building quality, amount of litter, crowding, degree of attraction and facilities quality. And reserved a number between -21 to +21 points                                                    | there are many factors to decide the Environmental Quality of an area, though the survey, we would have a clue what is the environmental quality of the area we studied about, and reflexed in the most intuitive way — numbers | the rate/10 reduces while the area we studied went away from the CBD, which linked to the hypothesis that EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD |
| TRAFFIC OPTIONS (lines) | qualitative   | We walked approximately 30 meters, around the center point of the place we studded and marked down every single traffic options for publics                                                                                                                       | This is to show how accessible the area is, by judging how many traffic options are available nearby.                                                                                                                            | This links to the hypothesis of amount of transport options decreasing with distance from the CBD                                                      |

## Trimming Plan

### Priority 1: Table Content Reduction (Remove ~25 words)
1. **Simplify "how we did it" column**
   - Remove redundant explanations
   - Use more concise language
   - Focus on essential methodology only

2. **Condense "why we did it" explanations**
   - Remove repetitive justifications
   - Streamline reasoning

### Priority 2: Minor Text Reduction (Remove ~16 words)
1. **Shorten introductory text**
2. **Remove redundant phrases** in table cells
3. **Tighten language** throughout

### Target Structure (200 words):
- **Date/Time info**: Keep as is (essential data)
- **Methodology table**: Condensed to ~180 words
- **Figure reference**: Keep (doesn't count toward word limit)

### Key Points to Preserve:
- Three measurement methods clearly defined
- Data collection procedures explained
- Link to hypotheses maintained
- Quantitative vs qualitative data distinction
- Time and location details
