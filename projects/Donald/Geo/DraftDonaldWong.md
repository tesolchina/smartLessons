Introduction

Location of Study

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a city located in the south of China People's Republic of China. There are few cities bordering Hong Kong, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Macau.

Victoria Harbour is the harbour connecting the two main CBDs of Hong Kong — Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island. In addition, Victoria Harbour is one of the world's most iconic natural harbors, and its history is deeply intertwined with Hong Kong's rise as a global trading hub.

To briefly introduce the Victoria Harbour, it is a natural deep-water gem named after Queen Victoria in 1841. In the beginning, there were fishermen fishing even before the founding of Hong Kong. Later on, as the population of GuangDong increased, aboriginal people started trading with the merchant ships passing by. Following the Opium War, Victoria Harbour has become one of the busiest ports in Asia. Nowadays the Victoria harbour handles over 200 million tons of cargo every year, and moreover it is attracting millions of tourists to Hong Kong with the extraordinary view.

The main focus of this study  is about finding how the characteristics changed from the distance from Vitoria Harbour, and test the hypothesis. To do so,  I decided to start with the street inside KowLoon, one of the CBDs in Hong Kong near Victoria Harbour. The exact location we studied is Nathan Road, Yau Tsim Mong District, KowLoon.


## Key Issues and Research Context

This investigation addresses several important urban geography concepts:

### Research Significance:
• **Urban Planning Relevance**: Understanding how urban characteristics change with distance helps city planners optimize resource allocation and development strategies
• **Hong Kong's Unique Context**: As one of the world's most densely populated cities (7,500 people per km²), Hong Kong provides an ideal case study for urban characteristic distribution
• **Economic Geography**: The relationship between distance from CBD and urban quality directly relates to land value theories and economic activity patterns
• **Transportation Planning**: How accessibility decreases with distance affects public transport planning and infrastructure development

### Challenges in Hong Kong's Urban Structure:
• **Limited Land**: Only 25% of Hong Kong's territory is developed due to mountainous terrain, forcing vertical development
• **Multiple CBDs**: Unlike traditional models, Hong Kong has several CBD areas (Central, Admiralty, Tsim Sha Tsui) rather than one central core
• **Colonial Legacy**: British colonial development created unique urban patterns different from typical Chinese cities
• **Public Housing Policy**: Government housing estates scattered throughout the territory disrupt traditional income-based residential patterns

### Expected Patterns vs. Reality:
• **Traditional Theory**: Burgess and Hoyt models predict clear zones radiating from city center
• **Hong Kong Reality**: Compact geography and efficient public transport create different patterns
• **Research Gap**: Limited studies on how traditional urban models apply to Asian mega-cities with unique geographical constraints

Background Theory

Burgess model (fig4) also known as the concentric ring model, is a model showing the development of cities and separating them into different areas including Central Business(CBD), Factories/ Industries, working class housing, middle class housing, and commuter zone. Designed in the 1920s, based on Chicago ,with the CBDs situated at the centre of the city, slowly extending outwards with the medium-class and low-class residential zones..

In Fig4, as we can see,  the outermost part of the model is the commuter zone. Other than being a commuting zone for people, it is also commonly a statement for high-end suburban or rural fringes. For people who don't like the noise near the city, usually relatively wealthy populations.

The middle class housing located between the commuter zone and working class housing, compared to working class, middle classes tend to have better income level, and more freedom of living style, and this has reflected on the quality and location of their housing. The working class may not be able to afford the long-time spending daily commuting, so they have to live in places near the factories or CBDs. Even this may lead to the increment of size and higher density of the housing. On the other hand, since the middle class have a better income level, and more flexibility on working hours, they live in more comfortable houses. Including lower density, more beautiful environment, better security.

Next to the main housing areas, there are factories and industries. Thanks to the low land price, companies and the low- income population tend to open factories and live in areas like this.  It's often run-down, with older buildings, pollution, and mixed uses, such as some cheap housing or slums. This zone emerges as industries seek cheap land near the center for easy transport of goods and workers.

On the other hand, in the center of a city, there is where the CBD is located. This is where most of the population of the city works and the most convenient place of the city. People can easily access the CBDs from almost anywhere from the city. Although the land prices are extremely high in the CBDs, there are still few luxury apartments in such, serving people who need  highly convenient transportation in their daily lives.

On account of the special(uneven, mountainous, coastal) terrain in Hong Kong, the Burgess model does not fit that well in reality in Hong Kong, or even be seen heuristically and inaccurately.

After being colonized by Great Britain, Hong Kong became Financial City instead of an industrial city with a larger number of factories and industry. Since people need quick access to the CBDs and the bigness of Hong Kong is able to fit in powerful public transportation, the government has quickly developed a convenient public transportation system. However this action has also raised the housing price of easily accessible areas. Which is the reason why the middle class housing is near the CBDs, factories are at the periphery area, and the  commuter zone and working class housing is in the middle. In addition, because of the high land price and human cost in Hong Kong, there are few factories opened in Hong Kong after the 1980s. This explained the look of distribution of each area in Hong Kong.

## Hypothesis

How do urban characteristics change with distance from victoria harbour, Hong Kong?

### Hypothesis 1: Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I believe that the noise level will decrease with the distance from the CBD because the more distance from the CBD the less accessible the area will be, so there will be less human activities and less noise will be created.

**Theoretical Justification**: According to central place theory and urban economic models, CBD areas experience the highest concentration of economic activity, resulting in maximum pedestrian traffic, vehicle movement, and commercial activity. The Bid-Rent Theory suggests that businesses willing to pay highest rents locate closest to the CBD for maximum accessibility, creating zones of intense activity that generate higher noise levels. As distance increases, accessibility decreases, leading to reduced economic activity and consequently lower noise levels.

### Hypothesis 2: EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

CBD stands for central business district, places away from it will be less economically active since then people will be willing to spend less money to build the architecture so the equity will not be as good as those in CBD.

**Theoretical Justification**: The Environmental Quality Score reflects investment levels in urban infrastructure and maintenance. According to urban economic theory, land values are highest near CBDs due to accessibility premiums. Higher land values justify greater investment in building quality, street maintenance, landscaping, and overall environmental improvements. The Concentric Zone Model suggests that environmental quality generally decreases with distance from the center due to reduced economic investment and lower property values in peripheral areas.

### Hypothesis 3: Amount of transport options will decrease with the distance from the CBD

One of the characteristics of CBD is highly accessible, which means that compared to the CBD the places away from it will be less accessible.

**Theoretical Justification**: Central Place Theory emphasizes that CBD areas require maximum accessibility to serve their function as centers of economic activity. Transport networks are designed to converge on CBD areas to facilitate the movement of workers, customers, and goods. The Hub-and-Spoke model of urban transportation typically creates highest transport density at city centers, with decreasing service frequency and route options as distance from the CBD increases. This pattern reflects the economic principle that transport provision follows demand patterns, which are highest in CBD areas.

Data Presentation& Analysis

Noice Level Records

Graph showing the change of  the average decibels while the distance from Victoria Harbour increases
Characterization
In the Noise Level graph, as we can see the decibel number is quite fluctuating, but still shows a subtle negative trend. (the slope is approximately -0.015/ supporting hypothesis ONE) The peak of the decibels being at around 0, 400, 800, 1200 and 1600 meters away from Victoria Harbour, the bottom points are at around 600-1700 meters away from Victoria Harbour.
Moreover, there are few small rises at around 200, 600, 1000, 1400 and 1800 meters away from the Harbour. They scored around 75 decibels. On the other hand, there are four low points at around 300, 700, 1100 and 1500 meters away from the Harbour. Their decibel record is around 65.
Furthermore, there are anomalies like sharp drops below the trend at around 250 and 1600 meters, not following the usual fluctuations.
Interpretation
Peaks (high points):
There are high population density places like shops, restaurants, and bus stops. These places are usually crowded and people tend to be talking while being in these areas. And since there are lots of people, they will have to raise their volume. Other than human voices, as mentioned, there are loud vehicles like buses, trucks and cars driving by, really close to the pedestrian path, which also forms part of the noises.
Bottom points (low points):
Even though the population density overall is high in the area we study, there are still places like back alleys, less popular restaurants and restricted shops where less people visit. Which most likely having less vehicles pass over, that explained why their noise level decreased.
Anomalies (Usual Patterns):
The High Anomaly is possibly caused by the construction site, machinery will cause loud noises. Workers in the site have to wear suitable ear protections, following the instruction from Hong Kong Labour Department 1. [https://www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/oh/noise.pdf]
The Low Anomaly is possibly caused by a remote street

EQS Scores

Graph showing the change of environments quality survey (EQS)  while the distance from Victoria Harbour increases

Characterization
In the EQS score graph, the lines are uneven, but showing a subtle negative trend. (the slope is approximately -0.005/ supporting hypothesis TWO) The peak of the EQS scours is at around 0.95, 1.25 and 1.75 km away from the Victoria Harbour, the bottom point is at around 1.35 km away from the Victoria Harbour.
In addition, there are few small rises at around 0.75, 1.3 and between 1.5 and 1.75 aways from the Harbour. They scored around 13 EQS points. On the other hand, there are four low points at around 0.6, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.75 km away from the harbour. Their EQS record is around -10.
Besides, there are anomalies like sudden negative spikes at around 0.75 km and 1.5 km, breaking from the near-zero pattern.
Interpretation
Peaks (high points):
The place where score high EQS proibbly are close to main road, or it is a visitor area that have fancy construsktions, causing high EQS score.
Bottom points (low points):
The palace where croe low EQS score are probably old districts with old, passed away and not renovated bulding, causing low EQS score, however since there are building requirements in Hong Kong so the bottom points would not be as low as the anomalies 1.
[https://www.bd.gov.hk/tc/safety-inspection/building-safety/index_bsi_defects.html ]
Anomalies (Usual Patterns):
The reason for the High Anomalies is that  there may be luxury shops/ restaurants, having extraordinary furnish that attract people and cause the EQS score to rise, however these shops are commonly in high-end shopping malls instead of off the street, so that  they become  anomalies.
The reason for Low Anomalies is that there could be graffiti on the building or too much trash on the street that has not been cleaned which affects the look of the street. Since the EQS is quite subjective and these cases are rare in Hong Kong, they become anomalies as well.

Traffic Option Counts

Graph showing the change of Traffic Options while the distance from Victoria Harbour increases
Characterization
In the Traffic Opinion graph, the plots are dispersed, forming a subtle negative trend. (the slope is approximately -0.0013/ supporting hypothesis THREE) The peak of the traffic counts is at around 200, 400, 600 and 800 meters away from Victoria Harbour, the bottom point is at around 1800 meters away from Victoria Harbour.
Beside that, there are few small rises at around 1000, 1200, 1400 and 1600 meters away from the Harbour. They scored around 13 traffic counts. On the other hand, there are four low points at around 900, 1100, 1300 and 1500 meters away from the Harbour. Their traffic record is around 5.
Additionally, there are anomalies like unexpected high points above the trend line at around 800 and 1500 meters, deviating from the general decline.

Interpretation
**Peaks (high points):**
The highest traffic option counts occur near the waterfront (200-800m) where multiple transport modes converge. These areas benefit from being major transport hubs where MTR stations (Tsim Sha Tsui Station), ferry terminals (Star Ferry), bus terminals, and taxi stands cluster together. The concentration reflects the hub-and-spoke transport model where different transport networks intersect at key nodes. High pedestrian traffic in these commercial areas also supports more frequent bus services and greater variety of transport options.

**Bottom points (low points):**
Lower traffic counts at 900-1500m distances correspond to more residential sections of Nathan Road where transport demand is primarily for commuting rather than commercial activity. These areas typically have fewer bus routes as they serve mainly local residential needs rather than tourist and business traffic. The reduced commercial activity means less demand for diverse transport options, resulting in more basic transport provision focused on essential connectivity.

**Anomalies (Unusual Patterns):**
The unexpected high point at 800m may correspond to the area around Jordan MTR Station, which serves as a secondary transport hub along Nathan Road. This creates a local peak in transport options despite being further from the main waterfront hub. The high point at 1500m could reflect the transport node around Yau Ma Tei MTR Station, where multiple bus routes converge to serve the station catchment area. These anomalies demonstrate that transport networks create multiple nodes of high accessibility rather than a simple linear decline with distance.

## Conclusion

Based on the data analysis and statistical evidence collected, the following conclusions can be drawn regarding how urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour:

### Hypothesis 1: Noise Level Decrease - **ACCEPTED**
The data supports this hypothesis with a negative slope of -0.015, demonstrating that noise levels generally decrease with distance from the CBD. Specific evidence shows noise levels declining from peaks of 75-80 decibels near the waterfront (0-400m) to lows of 58-65 decibels at greater distances (1500-1800m). Despite fluctuations caused by local factors such as construction sites and traffic patterns, the overall trend confirms that CBD proximity correlates with higher noise levels due to increased human and vehicular activity.

### Hypothesis 2: EQS Decrease - **ACCEPTED** 
Environmental Quality Survey scores show a subtle but consistent negative trend (slope: -0.005) with distance from Victoria Harbour. EQS scores peak at 13 points in areas closest to the waterfront (0.95-1.25km) where tourist infrastructure and commercial investment are highest, declining to -10 points in more distant areas (1.35-1.75km) where older residential districts predominate. This pattern reflects the economic investment gradient where proximity to the CBD justifies higher spending on environmental improvements and building maintenance.

### Hypothesis 3: Transport Options Decrease - **ACCEPTED**
Traffic option counts demonstrate a clear negative correlation (slope: -0.0013) with distance from the CBD. The highest concentrations of transport options (13+ different services) occur within 800m of Victoria Harbour where MTR stations, ferry terminals, bus hubs, and taxi services converge. Options decline to around 5 different services at distances beyond 1500m, confirming that transport networks are designed to maximize accessibility to CBD areas while providing more limited service to peripheral residential areas.

### Overall Research Question Answer:
Urban characteristics in Hong Kong **do change systematically with distance from Victoria Harbour**, following patterns predicted by urban geographic theory despite Hong Kong's unique topographical and developmental constraints. All three measured characteristics (noise, environmental quality, and transport accessibility) show declining trends with increased distance from the CBD, supporting traditional urban models while revealing the influence of local geographical and economic factors in creating variation within these general patterns.
## Evaluation

### Strengths of the Investigation

**Data Collection Methods**: The use of multiple data collection techniques (quantitative noise measurements, systematic EQS surveys, and transport option counts) provided comprehensive coverage of different urban characteristics. The systematic sampling along Nathan Road at regular intervals ensured representative data collection across the study area.

**Sample Size and Reliability**: Taking three measurements at each location and averaging results improved data reliability, particularly important given the use of smartphone apps rather than professional equipment. The team-based approach with multiple observers reduced individual bias in EQS assessments.

**Geographical Relevance**: Nathan Road provides an excellent transect for studying distance-decay relationships from Victoria Harbour, representing a clear gradient from CBD to more residential areas. The 1.8km study area captured sufficient variation to demonstrate clear patterns while remaining manageable for fieldwork.

**Theoretical Framework**: The investigation successfully applied established urban geographic theories (Burgess Model, Central Place Theory, Bid-Rent Theory) to interpret findings, demonstrating good understanding of theoretical concepts and their real-world applications.

### Limitations and Areas for Improvement

**Equipment Limitations**: The use of smartphone decibel meter apps rather than professional sound level meters may have introduced measurement errors and inconsistencies between different devices. Professional calibrated equipment would provide more accurate and reliable noise measurements.

**Weather Conditions**: Data collection during approaching typhoon conditions may have affected noise measurements due to wind interference and altered normal pedestrian and traffic patterns. Conducting fieldwork under normal weather conditions would provide more representative baseline data.

**Temporal Factors**: Data collection on a single day cannot account for temporal variations in urban characteristics. Traffic patterns, noise levels, and pedestrian activity vary significantly between weekdays/weekends and different times of day, potentially affecting the representativeness of findings.

**Sample Coverage**: The study focused solely on Nathan Road, which may not be representative of other corridors extending from Victoria Harbour. Including additional transects (e.g., Canton Road, Austin Road) would provide more comprehensive coverage of urban characteristic patterns.

**EQS Subjectivity**: Environmental Quality Survey scores involve subjective assessments that may vary between observers despite standardized criteria. More detailed scoring rubrics or photographic documentation would improve consistency.

### Suggestions for Future Research

**Extended Geographic Scope**: Future studies could expand beyond Nathan Road to include multiple transects radiating from Victoria Harbour, providing broader spatial coverage and testing whether patterns are consistent across different urban corridors.

**Temporal Analysis**: Conducting measurements at different times (morning/evening rush hours, weekdays/weekends) would reveal how temporal factors influence urban characteristic patterns and improve understanding of dynamic urban processes.

**Comparative Analysis**: Comparing findings with similar transects from other Hong Kong CBDs (Central, Admiralty) would test whether patterns are specific to Tsim Sha Tsui or represent general principles of Hong Kong urban structure.

**Professional Equipment**: Using calibrated professional equipment for noise measurement and air quality monitoring would improve data accuracy and allow for more precise analysis of environmental gradients.

**Longitudinal Study**: Repeating the investigation over multiple years could reveal how urban development and transport infrastructure changes affect the relationship between distance and urban characteristics over time.
