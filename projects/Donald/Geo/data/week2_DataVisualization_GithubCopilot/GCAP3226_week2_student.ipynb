    "# Data Visualization for Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme in Hong Kong\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook guides you through data visualization techniques using Python, focusing on the Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme dataset in Hong Kong. This aligns with the *Empowering Citizens through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong* course, supporting SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). You will learn to:\n",
    "1. Load and examine a dataset.\n",
    "2. Understand its structure and variables.\n",
    "3. Visualize categorical data with frequency tables, bar charts, and pie charts.\n",
    "4. Analyze continuous data with summary statistics, box-whisker plots, and histograms.\n",
    "5. Explore relationships using scatter plots.\n",
    "6. Save visualizations to a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use GitHub Copilot to assist by writing prompts (e.g., comments like `# Write code to...`) to generate Python code. Libraries required: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 0: Import Relevant Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, let’s make sure your computer has the tools we need, called libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`). If you see an error when running the code below, follow these simple steps to add them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On **Windows**: Click the Windows icon to open the Start menu, type “Command Prompt,” and click it to open.\n",
    "- On **macOS**: Click the magnifying glass (top right) to open Spotlight Search, type “Terminal,” and click it to open.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the window that opens, type this command and press Enter: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`. If it shows \"command not found: pip\", try `python3 -m pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you get a permission error, add `--user` at the end, like `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn --user`. (If this doesn’t work, ask your instructor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the libraries, try running the next code cell (the one asks you to write prompt to import pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn). If it works without errors, you’re ready to continue. If it shows an error (e.g., ‘ModuleNotFoundError’), you need to update the notebook’s settings. To do this, click the kernel name (e.g., ‘base’) in the top-right corner—don’t worry if it’s different, just click it—and look for a ‘Restart’ option in the dropdown. If you don’t see it, press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette, type ‘Jupyter: Restart Kernel’ and select it. Restarting refreshes the notebook to use the new libraries. After restarting, run the next code cell again to confirm it works. If you’re still stuck, ask your instructor for help. \n",
