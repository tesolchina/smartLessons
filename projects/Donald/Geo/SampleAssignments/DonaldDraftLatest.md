# Introduction

## Location of Study

Located in the south of People's Republic of China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a city in the Greater Bay Area bordering Shenzhen (Fig.1) and connected to Zhuhai and Macau via the Hong Kong-Zhuahi-Macau bridge.  Named after Queen Victoria in the 19th century, Victoria Harbour underwent the evolution from a fishing area into Asia's most hectic ports. Today it connects Kowloon Peninsular and Hong Kong Island (Fig. 2), where two main Central Business Districts (CBDs) are located. Studying this area is central to understanding the urban characteristics and challenges of the city's high-density development.

As it evolved into a global financial centre, Hong Kong also face considerable urban challenges. Given its population densities that was among the world's highest and with many people moving to the New Territories, access to the CBD through transportation networks has become a critical issue. Rapid urbanisation has raised concerns about noise pollution and environmental quality.  These challenges raised important questions about how the landscape of the city and its key characteristics vary across different distances from CBD.

In this study, we focus on three key urban characteristics—noise levels, Environmental Quality Score (EQS), and transportation options—and explore how they change with distance from the harbour to answer the research question: "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?" This investigation tests three hypotheses about these characteristics. To investigate the patterns, Nathan Road in the Yau Tsim Mong district was selected as the focus as the road connects the CBD of Kowloon to more distant areas (Fig. 3), offering a good case study for answering the research question.

Fig 4.  A picture of burgess model

 ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z3h7sg8/revision/2](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z3h7sg8/revision/2) )

Burgess model (Fig4) also known as the concentric ring model, is a model showing the development of cities and separating them into different areas including Central Business(CBD), Factories/ Industries, working class housing, middle class housing, and commuter zone. The burgess model is designed in the 1920s, based on Chicago ,with the CBDs situated at the centre of the city, slowly extending outwards with the medium-class and low-class residential zones.

The model is relevant and suitable to the present study as it explores how urban characteristics change with distance from the city centre following specific patterns. The basic principle of the model is that urban intensity declines with the increasing distance from CBD, generating gradients in economic activities, population density and infrastructure quality that are predictable.  Not surprisingly, higher noise level is typically experiences in locations closer to the CBD thanks to more concentrated traffic and business activities. People near the CBD also enjoy better environment and more transportation options. The general theoretical principles offers a framework for better understanding how the urban characteristics vary along Nathan Road as people moved away from Victoria Harbour.

The Burgess model identifies various urban zones, each with varying characteristic patterns of noise, environmental quality, and accessibility. At the center, the CBD is the most convenient place of the city where people can easily access the office buildings and business activities from almost anywhere. As a result, we observe highest concentration of transportation options and economic activity. Moving outward, one can find the industrial zone as industries rely on inexpensive land near the center for easy transport. This is an area with higher noise levels from factories and run-down, older buildings with lower environmental quality. According to the model, people living in the working class housing zone experiences moderate noise and environmental conditions as they live near the factories or areas with higher density housing. The middle class zone, on the other hand, provides lower density, more beautiful environment, and better security and lower noise level. The outermost commuter zone attracts people who prefer quieter environment. According to the model, transportation options will decrease as we move away from CBD just like noise level and environmental quality, in line with the hypotheses of this study.

Nevertheless, since Hong Kong has many uneven, mountainous areas, the Burgess model has to be adapted before it can be applied in our study. Since the adoption of open door policy in Mainland China, Hong Kong has developed its financial sector and become a world financial centre. With more people living in the New Territories to commute to the CBDs, the government has gradually built an extensive public transportation system composed of underground railway (MTR), buses, public light buses and ferries. However, the housing prices have also increased significantly in the areas with good transport access.  These patterns led to differences in access to transportation- some areas near the harbour feature more options while areas further away with fewer choices. These patterns in Hong Kong along roads like Nathan Road enable us to focus on this area to investigate how urban characteristics change as we move away from CBDs.

## Hypotheses

To answer the research question — "How do urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong?" — here are three hypotheses.

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I believe that the noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD because the greater the distance from the CBD, the less accessible the area will be, so there will be fewer human activities and less noise will be created.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

Places away from the CBD will be less economically active, so people will be willing to spend less money to build the architecture. Therefore, the environmental quality will not be as good as those in the CBD.

3. The number of transport options will decrease with distance from the CBD

One of the characteristics of the CBD is high accessibility, which means that compared to the CBD, places away from it will be less accessible.

By testing these hypotheses, we will better understand the patterns of urban development in Hong Kong and gain valuable insights on urban planning and policy making with regard to transportation infrastructure, environmental protection and housing development.

# Data Presentation& Analysis

1. ## Noice Level Records

![]()

Figure 6: Average noise levels (decibels) at different distances from Victoria Harbour along Nathan Road

### Characterization

In the noise level graph, we can see that the decibel numbers go up and down a lot, but there is still a downward trend overall. The slope is about -0.015, which supports our first hypothesis. We collected data from 30 different places along Nathan Road, and the noise levels range from 58 dB to 84 dB.

The loudest noise we measured was 84 dB at 250 meters from Victoria Harbour. The quietest place was 58 dB at 1650 meters away. There are several high points around 250m, 560m, 800m, and 1450m where the noise was about 75-77 dB. The low points were around 800m, 1000m, and 1250m where it was about 67-68 dB.

The blue dashed line in the graph shows the general trend. Even though the individual measurements are quite different from each other, the overall pattern shows that noise gets quieter as we move away from Victoria Harbour. This supports our hypothesis that noise levels decrease with distance from the CBD. There are some unusual readings like the very high one at 250m and the very low one at 1650m that don't follow the normal pattern.

### Interpretation

Peaks (high points):

There are high population density places like shops, restaurants, and bus stops. These places are usually crowded and people tend to be talking while being in these areas. And since there are lots of people, they will have to raise their volume. Other than human voices, as mentioned, there are loud vehicles like buses, trucks and cars driving by, really close to the pedestrian path, which also forms part of the noises.

Bottom points (low points):

Even though the population density overall is high in the area we study, there are still places like back alleys, less popular restaurants and restricted shops where less people visit. Which most likely having less vehicles pass over, that explained why their noise level decreased.

Anomalies (Usual Patterns):

The High Anomaly is possibly caused by the construction site, machinery will cause loud noises. Workers in the site have to wear suitable ear protections, following the instruction from Hong Kong Labour Department 1. [[https://www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/oh/noise.pdf](https://www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/oh/noise.pdf)]

The Low Anomaly is possibly caused by a remote street

#### Interpretation

High noise areas (peaks):

When we collected data in Nathan Road, we noticed human activities are the main source of noise. Among the noisiest places were  shopping areas like the ones in Tsim Sha Tsui, where many tourists and locals talking loudly. Another really noisy place is bus stops because people have to speak louder when buses arrive. Restaurants and shops are also source of noise pollution as music is played and air conditioning is on.

Not surprisingly, traffic remains the main cause for noise pollution. There are many buses and cars that drive across Nathan Road, making a lot of noise. The sound is louder when they stop or start moving, affecting pedestrians on the sidewalk. During our data collection, we identified a number of intersections that were particularly noisy because of all the vehicles.

Quiet areas (low points):

Nathan Road is well known for its hectic activities. Nevertheless, some quieter places were found, e.g. small side streets or areas between big buildings. We saw fewer people around these areas. Some older residential buildings were also quieter, probably because there were few shops on the ground floor. Overall, places tend to be less noisy when fewer cars drive by and less commercial activities are happening.

Unusual readings:

Some surprisingly high reading was noted at 250 m. In retrospect, we think a probable cause could be the construction work on that day. Excessive noise could come from all the drilling and machinery operating.

The reading at 1650m was unexpectedly low. This area seemed to have more residential buildings further from the main commercial district. so it makes sense that it would be quieter than other parts of Nathan Road.

2. ## EQS Scores

Figure 7. Environmental Quality Survey (EQS) scores along a transect extending inland from Victoria Harbour

### Characterization

As can be seen in Figure 7, the EQS scores show great spatial variability across the 2 km transect from Victoria Harbour. A weak negative correlation is observed (regression slope = -0.005), suggesting a slight decrease in environmental quality with distance. This overall statistical trend supports the second hypothesis regarding the distance-quality relationship. The range of scores spans from -18 to +17, indicating considerable variation in environmental conditions.

Primary peaks are identified at 0.9 km (+12 points), 1.1 km (+14 points), and 1.8 km (+12 points) from Victoria Harbour. Secondary elevated scores are recorded at approximately 0.6 km, 0.7 km, and 1.7 km, with values ranging from +5 to +8 points. The positive scores suggest above-average environmental conditions at these locations. Conversely, significant negative valleys occur at 0.8 km (-8 points), 1.4 km (-17 points, representing the lowest recorded value), 1.5 km (-10 points), and 1.6 km (-9 points). The distribution pattern indicates the absence of clear proximity-based clustering near the harbour, with both high and low quality areas distributed throughout the transect.  Despite the variability found in the individual data points, the overall downward trend suggests that the environmental quality has the tendency to decline with the increasing distance from Victoria Harbour. Nevertheless, the weak correlation coefficient implies that local factors play a more important role than distance in influencing environmental quality.

### Interpretation

Peaks (high points)

In every probability, the areas that contain high EQS are the ones that are near the main road or the visitor places that possess fancy constructions that lead to high EQS. They are nice areas as they receive more attention and money is spent on ensuring that they are clean and appealing. This may be tourist attraction places or shopping streets.

Bottom points (low points):

The kind of locations that tends to be associated with low EQS can be deduced on the fact that the buildings in the vicinity are ancient, in disrepairs and not well managed. However, due to the building demand in Hong Kong, those low points would not even drop to the rank of really bad anomalies. It is even as far as they are worse places as it cannot be too bad because the government have laws on maintaining buildings in a safe and decent condition.

Anomalies (Unusual Patterns):

High Anomalies: It may include luxury boutiques or restaurants with furniture that is too unusual to an extent that EQS score spikes. But it is these stores in virtually every instance, which are located in the shopping centers of the high-end shopping centers and not on the street, which becomes an exception as they become fancier than the ordinary places on the street.

Low Anomalies: There can be graffiti on a building or a litter-filled street that has not been cleaned yet and this has an effect on the appearance of the street. As the EQS is rather subjective, and such cases are not common in Hong Kong, they also cause anomalies. The very low score of 1.4 km is likely to be one of these peculiar problem areas.

Overall Pattern:

As it has been proved, the farther one is located away Victoria Harbour, the less attractive the area is. In closer proximity such aspects as the amount of resources being spent on maintenance, the type of buildings found in the area and the degree of the areas management are significantly more crucial than the mere distance to water.

3. ## Traffic Option Counts

![]()

Graph showing the change of Traffic Options while the distance from Victoria Harbour increases

### Characterization

In the Traffic Option Counts graph, the blue dots are scattered all over the place, but there is still a slight downward trend shown by the red line. The equation is y = -0.0013x + 13.11, which means the slope is -0.0013. This supports my third hypothesis that traffic options decrease with distance.

The highest points on the graph are around 700-800 meters and 1600 meters from Victoria Harbour, where there are about 33-37 traffic options. The lowest point is at around 1800 meters, where there are almost no traffic options (close to 0).

Most of the dots are between 5-25 traffic options. There are some points that are much higher than the red trend line, like the ones at 700m, 800m, and 1600m. These are unusual because they have way more traffic options than expected. There are also some very low points at around 900m, 1400m, and 1800m that have less than 5 traffic options.

### Interpretation

High points (many traffic options):

The areas with the most traffic options (33-37 options) are probably where major MTR stations or transport hubs are located. At around 700-800 meters, this could be near Tsim Sha Tsui or Jordan stations, which are very busy areas with lots of buses, taxis, and MTR lines. The high point at 1600 meters might be another major station like Prince Edward or Mong Kok, which also have many transport connections.

Low points (few traffic options):

The areas with very few traffic options (0-5 options) are probably in between the major stations or in less developed areas. These places might only have a few bus routes and no MTR stations nearby. People living here would have to walk further to find good transportation.

Unusual patterns (anomalies):

The very high points that are above the trend line show that even though we're moving away from Victoria Harbour, some places still have excellent transport connections. This happens because Hong Kong's transport system is built around major stations that serve as hubs, not just distance from the harbour.

The very low points show that some areas are really poorly connected, which makes sense because not every street can have a station or many bus stops.

This data supports my hypothesis that transport options generally decrease with distance from Victoria Harbour, but there are some exceptions where major transport hubs create areas with lots of options even when they're far from the CBD.

# Conclusion

This study investigated the change of urban characteristics with the distance to Victoria Harbour along the Nathan Road. To answer our research question, we applied three hypotheses concerning the noise levels, EQS and transportation options.

Hypothesis: The level of noise will reduce as one goes further away the CBD. We were right in our first hypothesis. The statistics indicate that the levels of noise diminish with distance (slope = -0.015). We registered the loudest noise at 250m harbour at 84 dB and the lowest noise at 1650m at 58 dB. This justifies the Burgess model due to high traffic and business activities in the CBD which cause noise.

Hypothesis 2: EQS will be reduced with the distance to the CBD. This was a hypothesis that was hardly supported (slope = -0.005). There was much variation in EQS scores between -18 and +17. There were also good scores such as +14 at 1.1km which were distant to the harbour. This can imply that factors such as construction maintenance and cleanliness are local and are more valuable than a distance as far as Victoria Harbour.

Hypothesis 3: A distance between the CBD and transport options will be found to decrease. The third hypothesis was acceptable (slope = -0.0013). The travel choices were maximum of 33-37 around MTR stations at 700-800m and 1600m. The lowest was almost 0 at 1800m. This indicates that the transport system in Hong Kong is structured around centres of big areas but not evenly distributed.

Overall Answer The features of the urban areas vary with the distance to Victoria Harbour not necessarily in a straightforward manner. Burgess model is useful in explaining some of the trends, although the geographical peculiarity of Hong Kong and its excellent transport system are exceptions to normal urban models.

# Evaluation

## Positives of my study

For this study overall, the collection of data and the compilation of that data went very well. Firstly, the data collection was quite efficient with students split up into groups and spreading out to the different data collection sites along Nathan Road. Everyone had equal involvement in the tasks, which was quite good. We managed to cover a good distance of 1.8km from Victoria Harbour and took multiple readings at each location.

## What could have gone better? How I would improve this

| What could have gone better | How I would improve this |
| --- | --- |
| The first problem with some of the data collection is that we were all using a phone app for the noise level data set, however not every phone will have the same set of microphones, and therefore some may be more sensitive, and some may filter out more excess noise. | To address the noise data issue, I believe it would be better for all of us to use standardised equipment, such as a proper decibel meter, this can eliminate the variations caused by the difference in microphones used. |
| Additionally, the EQS scoring was quite subjective and different team members sometimes gave different scores for the same area, which could affect our results. | For the EQS scoring, we could have clearer criteria for each category and maybe take photos to review later, this would make our scoring more consistent and reliable. |
| The weather wasn't ideal during data collection - it was quite windy which probably affected our noise readings when the wind hit the phone microphones. | For the issue with the weather, simply waiting a few days for the weather to clear up would possibly make the investigation better and give more accurate noise measurements. |
| We only collected data on one day during school hours, so we don't know if the patterns would be the same at different times or on weekends. | If we had more time, collecting data over multiple days and different times would show whether our findings are consistent and representative of normal conditions. |
