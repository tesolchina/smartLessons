Background Theory
Hong Kong: the special administrative region of China is located on the southern coast of China, specifically on the southeastern end of the province Guangdong. It is divided by three distinct territories, being the Hong Kong Island, New Territories and Kowloon. The Kowloon Peninsula — where our case study takes place, is on the southern side of Hong Kong, specifically taking place in Nathan Road of Tsim Sha Tsui, next to the waterfront of Victoria Harbour of Hong Kong.

Hypotheses
(Noise Level will decrease with distance from the CBD): It is predicted that noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD as they are busy areas of a city, filled with people.
(Building height will decrease with distance from the CBD): It is predicted that building height will decrease as distance from the CBD increases because the tallest buildings would be used for companies and business means which needs room for many people and departments.
(High order services will decrease with distance from the CBD): It is predicted that CBDs will have more high order services than other areas of a city as CBDs are often the wealthier zones of a city, a high threshold population can also support more expensive businesses.

How Urban Models Relate to Hong Kong
The Burgess Model predicts a city structure through concentric zones with the CBDs situated at the centre of the city, slowly extending outwards with the medium-class and low-class residential zones. As the model was directly based on Chicago’s urban structure, the Burgess Model itself can be seen heuristically or even inaccurate when applied to other cities or in this context — Hong Kong.




The distinguished CBDs Admiralty, Central and Wan Chai are examples of the economic staples of Hong Kong all of which are located on the northern shore of Hong Kong Island. This aspect of CBDs in the centre does fit the description of what Burgess suggests, though not accurately describing the rest of the urban areas. Many factories of Hong Kong are located in the Greater Bay Area of mainland China. The low and medium class residential buildings are found throughout the three main divided zones of Hong Kong, with most living in the approximate residential areas of 127 kilometres squared in Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon urban area combined. The high-class residential zones are found on Hong Kong Island too, spanning at an estimated 27 kilometres squared as private residential apartments or village housing. Thus, proving that while the Burgess Model can predict the CBDs’ location in Hong Kong, it does not accurately represent the rest of the mapping of Hong Kong. This directly challenges my hypothesis suggesting that building height will decrease with distance from CBDs as my justification for taller buildings in a CBD could be more effectively utilised for economic activity and businesses. The Sorrento Tower 6 or The HarbourSide are only some examples of tall buildings being used for housing, overall disproving this theory.

The Hoyt Model was introduced as a modification of the Burgess Model with the difference being that Hoyt suggesting the presence of factories would induce everyone but the poorest of citizens to not live near them as pollution and environmental hazards are more prominent near these factories. The middle and upper-class are found away from the factories, arguing that a system of hierarchies existed.

Relating back to Hong Kong, the Hoyt Model also finds limited application. Factories are proposed to be surrounding the low-class residential sector but finds irrelevancy since Hong Kong’s factories are not within the city. The middle and low-class residential zones are also commonly situated nearby together as well, typically being in Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula. Buildings holding cramped spaces of 400 square feet like Leng Chau Building are also located near more comfortable residential apartments like Cullinan West. High-class apartment complexes can be found throughout 0Hong Kong Island’s as well, some of these include the district Happy Valley in Wan Chai or Larvotto in Aberdeen. Conversely, although the Hoyt Model does not precisely predict the rest of the structure of Hong Kong, it does get validation to an extent from the description of distribution of high order services in a city, supporting my hypothesis. As shown, many high-end services like The Peninsula; a five-star hotel, shopping malls like the Prestige Tower or iSquare are found on Nathan Road too.

Data Presentation and Analysis

(Noise Level will decrease with distance from the CBD):

The graph above shows the decibel readings per 100 metres of the entire Nathan Road from Victoria Harbour to the Nathan Road-Boundary Street Intersection.  As can be seen from the scatter plot graph, the peak of the decibel readings is at 84dB at 200 metres from Victoria Harbour, as the decibel readings stay at a range of 67dB to 74dB from 250 metres up to 760 metres, there is a sudden spike of 79dB at 770 metres and hovers at a range of 66dB up to 76dB until 1500 metres into Nathan Road. The decibel readings slowly decrease in figures as it decreases to 70dB at 1510 metres, a sudden increase to 74dB and a depression until 58dB at 1600 metres and some increases at 1650 to 1700 metres.

The data itself justifies my hypothesis of decreasing loudness with increasing distance as can be seen with the subtle depression of noise over distance with the starting distance of 50 metres having a decibel reading of 75 compared to the decibel reading at 1600 metres from Victoria Harbour of 65. The constant spikes of noise recorded like the sudden influx at 750 metres with a decibel reading of 79dB can be due to sudden honks produced by the horns of cars, active construction sites or pedestrian activity as well. The overall decrease in volume with distance can be explained by a multitude of reasons too, with speculations of increased concentrations of human activity, more traffic or industrial operations as well.



(Building height will decrease with distance from the CBD):


The second graph above depicts the average heights of buildings estimated with storeys with distance from Victoria Harbour. Though there is no clear correlation that can be seen in this graph, the line of best fit does tell us there is a slight decrease in overall building height with distance from the CBD. Buildings’ heights at a range of 200 to 900 metres can be seen with a height from 4 to 25 storeys while distances of 1000 metres and beyond have a building height of 7 to 23 storeys.

The line graph recorded above can partially prove my hypothesis correct, but the lack of trends reduces my graph’s reliability. This demonstrates that many buildings of different heights can be used in different means too outside of business or economic activity, they can also be utilised for apartment complexes. Other than the utilities of buildings not dependent on their heights, the height of buildings in Victoria Harbour may also not make a noticeable difference than other buildings outside the CBD due to the number of tall buildings located in other CBDs of Hong Kong and the conveniency of transportation in Hong Kong. With the tallest building in Hong Kong — The International Commerce Centre (ICC) being located in Kowloon East rather than the mentioned CBDs, it is fair to say that Hong Kong leverages its compact proximities for CBDs and high-efficiency transit networks.


(High order services will decrease with distance from the CBD):


This final bar chart exhibits the high and low order services with distance from Victoria Harbour. At 200 — 500 metres from Victoria Habour, we can see 4 high order services compared to the 2 low order services only, throughout 500 —1400 metres of Nathan Road, the amount of 2 to 3 high order services stays unchanged while the amount of 3 low order services also remains the same.  At 1400 —1800 metres, there are 2 low order services compared to the sudden influx of 10 low order services.

The data collected and presented shows a relative correlation between the count of high order services and rise of low order services with distance from the CBD, somewhat supporting my hypothesis. At 200 —500 metres of distance, we can see 4 high order services closest to areas of the CBD, simultaneously supporting the Bid-Rent Theory; stating that high order services would be more clustered around a CBD to allow for accessibility to their target demographic. This can also apply at 1400 —1800 metres, where a sudden inundation of 10 services of low order appears. Though the areas closest to the CBD have more high order services; the total number of low order services furthest away from the CBD still surpasses the amount of high order services, this can be due to the majority of the population being of low or middle class, and simply investing more establishments towards a larger customer audience would be less risky and also guarantee customers.


Conclusion
After data presenting and analysing, it can be concluded that noise level does decrease with distance from the CBD, with data showing that noise levels decrease from 75dB at 50 metres to 65dB at 1600 metres from Victoria Harbour, despite anomalies of sudden spikes or drops at 79dB at 770 metres may occur, the overall trend evidences my hypothesis correct. Our second hypothesis suggested that there would be a decrease in height for buildings with further distances along Nathan Road. While the line of best fit in my line graph shows a slight decrease in building height over distance, buildings ranged from 4 to 25 storeys near Victoria Harbour all the way to 7 to 23 storeys further away, along with the abundance of anomalous results, this only suggests that the height of buildings in Hong Kong are influenced beyond just the proximity of them to a CBD. My third and final set of data, representing the correlation between distance from the CBD shows 4 high-order services within 500 metres of Victoria Harbour compared to only 2 low-order services and 2 premium services with a dominant 10 low-order services at 1400 —1800 metres, confirming my hypothesis and the bid-rent theory along with the concentration of premium services near CBDs.

| Data collection method | Type of data collected | How we collected the data | Why we collected the data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Decibel reading | Quantitative/qualitative | Using an in-app decibel meters, we can measure noise levels from three different areas, furthering distance each time. | It is predicted that since CBDs are the busiest areas of city: commotion, amount of people and amount of traffic can also affect this. |
| Building height | Quantitative | Counting the number of storeys in a building to estimate their heights. | It is predicted that most of the tallest buildings in an area would be in a CBD as we would use them for business, with distance from the CBD would only decrease building height. |
| High/low order | Qualitative | Scanning the services and shops near our designated location to determine if it is high or low order. | It is predicted that the amount of high order services will decrease with distance from the CBD as CBDs are the wealthier zones of a city. |




| What went well with the data collection: | What could have been improved: | How the investigation is improved given with the opportunity for a redo: | Impacts of the improvements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collection of noise level data was done well as we chose the busiest time of Nathan Road to measure it. | As we used mobile decibel meters, uncalibrated microphones may appear faulty compared to real decibel meters. | By going inside each shop and taking an average for their prices, we can determine truly if they are high or low order services. | The readings from the decibel meters will be louder, giving more reliable data. |
| We identified each building in our area and took their averages by counting their buildings’ storeys three times. | As our method of estimating building height used the counting of building storeys to make an estimate, irregular or different sized storeys may be poorly estimated. | By using a different method like the pencil method, we can more accurately determine the height of buildings. | The heights of buildings may have a large difference when counted using a different method, the data will be more accurate and realistic. |
| We recognised most stores found in Nathan Road, allowing us to understand the baseline of the commercial environment. | As we had pre-existing knowledge on the stores beforehand, possible biases or assumptions may have been made, stores we did not recognise may also get miscategorised. | By doing research on each shop before counting them to a category or by taking an average price for the goods they offer inside their services. | Minor changes might be made to the data as some stores will be recategorised. The anomalies found at 1400– 1800 may also differ and regularise. |
