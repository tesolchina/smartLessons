We need to look at Donald's latest draft in Google docs 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nPsKZbUZUtzyZcR73DZ2mQL8zC6TvA28orVh7g7-LJA/edit?tab=t.q8vd8r7w0iqd

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/Donald/Geo/SampleAssignments

we have some sample assignments here 

and a draft here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/Donald/Geo/DraftDonaldWong.docx


Donald will go through the draft with me and raise some questions for discussion 

Let's compare his draft with the two sample assignments and identify areas for improvement 

throughout the process of tutoring, AI can suggest plans and actions but cannot edit the texts directly 


please turn all the docx into md using python codes /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/Donald/Geo/HowtoA.md
