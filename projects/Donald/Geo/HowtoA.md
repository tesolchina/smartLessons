- Have you described the sampling method?
- Have you justified the sampling method?

### Example Table

| Method                             | Type of data collected        | How we did it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Why we did it.                                                                                                                                        | Link to Hypothesis |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Environmental Quality Survey (EQS) | Quantitative and Qualitative. | We went to the predetermined location. Firstly, we wrote a description of the area and then gave a score between +2 and –2 based on a number of fixed criteria. Categories included Open spaces, litter, vandalism, building condition. +2 was a score of excellent, -2 a score of very poor. | So that we could find out the quality of the environment. This is a good indicator of the impacts of tourism and helps to answer my first hypothesis. |                    |

## Data Presentation and Analysis

The data presentation and analysis should be structured as follows:

- Hypothesis 1: Write out your hypothesis again.
- Insert your chart/graph/map
- Describe your results
- Explain your results
- Then repeat the above for hypothesis 2.

## Data Presentation

This is the section where you create graphs/maps/charts that show the data that you collected on the fieldtrip. It is important to make sure you use the most appropriate presentation method for the data you have. You must have at least THREE different data presentation techniques.

- Have you created at least one graph/map for each of your hypothesis?
- Is all the data you have presented relevant to your hypothesis?
- Have you created at least one of your graphs/charts by hand?
- Have you created three different charts/graphs/maps? (ie. Don't use three bar charts – that only counts as one technique).
- If you are using photographs, are they annotated?
- Do all of your graphs have a title?
- Do they have a figure number?
- Are the axis labelled?
- Have you included the raw data tables?

## Analysis

This is the longest section (in terms of words). Look back at your results from the graphs that you have created. What do they show/tell you? In this section you will be describing and explaining the results, and looking for any anomalies that don’t fit the patterns.

- Described the results?
  - Used data to support your description?
  - Described the highest numbers?
  - Described the lowest numbers?
  - Described the anomalies? (things that don't fit the usual patterns)
- Explained (give reasons for) the results?
  - Explained the highs?
  - Explained the lows?
  - Explained the anomalies?
  - Used geographical theory/secondary research to help?
- Is the word count roughly 900-1000 words?

## What Does This Graph Show? How Would You Analyse This Graph?

*(Note: This page refers to a graph on CO2 emissions per capita for countries like the United States, China, United Kingdom, and India over time from 1750 to 2023. In Markdown, describe or analyze as needed, but the original includes a visual graph.)*

## Conclusion

- Have you concluded each of your hypotheses?
- Have you used data to support each of your conclusions? (this should be at least one piece of important data that backs up what you are saying)
- Have you concluded and answered your overall fieldwork question?
- Is the word count 200-250 words?

The conclusions you draw/make should be as a result of analysing the data you collected. Conclusions should also all relate to the purpose of the study and your defined hypotheses.

## Evaluation

This section evaluates what you have done (strengths and/or weaknesses) and makes suggestions for how the study could have been improved if you were given the opportunity to do it again. You can do it in a table or in paragraph form.

- Have you talked about what went well?
- Have you talked about what could be improved (think about the data collection methods/time of day/weather etc)?
- Have you talked about how the investigation could be improved if you had the opportunity to do it again?
- What would be the impact of the improvement?
- Is it roughly 200-250 words?
