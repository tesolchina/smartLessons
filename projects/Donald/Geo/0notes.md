~~we have more data here please update /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/Donald/Geo/Explore_and_visualize_data.md~~

~~also take into account his draft /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/Donald/Geo/draft8Sept.docx and guide /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/Donald/Geo/HowtoA.md~~

~~he's got some dataset and needs help to generate some graphs~~

~~but he does not indicate clearly what graphs or charts he wants~~

~~Let's first explore what charts and graphs could be generated based on the data ~/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/Donald/Geo/data~~

~~we can create a new note - Explore and visualize data for the Geo project to outline what is possible - do not write any codes yet~~
