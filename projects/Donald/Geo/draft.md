Located in the south of China People's Republic of China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a city in the Greater Bay Area bordering Shenzhen and connected to Zhuhai and Macau via the HKZM bridge.

Victoria Harbour is the harbour connecting the two main CBDs of Hong Kong — Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island. In addition, Victoria Harbour is one of the world's most iconic natural harbors, and its history is deeply intertwined with Hong Kong's rise as a global trading hub.

To briefly introduce the Victoria Harbour, it is a natural deep-water gem named after Queen Victoria in 1841. In the beginning, there were fishermen fishing even before the founding of Hong Kong. Later on, as the population of GuangDong increased, aboriginal people started trading with the merchant ships passing by. Following the Opium War, Victoria Harbour has become one of the busiest ports in Asia. Nowadays the Victoria harbour handles over 200 million tons of cargo every year, and moreover it is attracting millions of tourists to Hong Kong with the extraordinary view.

The main focus of this study  is about finding how the characteristics changed from the distance from Vitoria Harbour, and test the hypothesis. To do so,  I decided to start with the street inside KowLoon, one of the CBDs in Hong Kong near Victoria Harbour. The exact location we studied is Nathan Road, Yau Tsim Mong District, KowLoon.

## SIMPLIFIED REVISION NOTES - FOCUS ON CHALLENGES

### **Key Challenge Points to Add (2-3 main points):**

**Challenge 1: Extreme Urban Density**
• Hong Kong is one of the world's most densely populated cities (7,500 people per km²)
• Limited land availability forces intense competition for space
• Understanding how urban quality changes with distance helps planners make better decisions about where to locate services and housing

**Challenge 2: Geographic Constraints** 
• Only 25% of Hong Kong's territory can be developed due to mountainous terrain
• This forces all development to be concentrated in small areas
• Studying distance patterns helps identify how to best use limited developable land

**Challenge 3: Complex Urban Structure**
• Unlike typical cities, Hong Kong has multiple CBD areas (Central, Admiralty, Tsim Sha Tsui) instead of one center
• Traditional urban models may not apply to this unique structure
• Research is needed to understand how urban characteristics work in this multi-centered system

### **How to Connect Challenges to Research Question:**

**Simple linking statements to add:**
• "By understanding how urban characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour, city planners can better address these density and land use challenges"
• "This research helps identify patterns that could inform future urban development in similar high-density environments"
• "The findings may reveal whether traditional urban planning theories apply to Hong Kong's unique geographic and developmental constraints"

### **Where to Insert in Current Text:**

**After paragraph 3** (Nathan Road study location):
Add 1 paragraph about the main challenges Hong Kong faces

**Before hypothesis section:**
Add 1-2 sentences connecting how the research addresses these challenges

### **Simple Integration Strategy:**
1. Keep all original content as is
2. Add ONE new paragraph about challenges after describing study location
3. Add ONE sentence before hypotheses explaining research relevance
4. Keep the same friendly, accessible writing style

=====================

**### Research Significance:

• Urban Planning Relevance: Understanding how urban characteristics change with distance helps city planners optimize resource allocation and development strategies • Hong Kong's Unique Context: As one of the world's most densely populated cities (7,500 people per km²), Hong Kong provides an ideal case study for urban characteristic distribution • Economic Geography: The relationship between distance from CBD and urban quality directly relates to land value theories and economic activity patterns • Transportation Planning: How accessibility decreases with distance affects public transport planning and infrastructure development

### Challenges in Hong Kong's Urban Structure:

• Limited Land: Only 25% of Hong Kong's territory is developed due to mountainous terrain, forcing vertical development • Multiple CBDs: Unlike traditional models, Hong Kong has several CBD areas (Central, Admiralty, Tsim Sha Tsui) rather than one central core • Colonial Legacy: British colonial development created unique urban patterns different from typical Chinese cities • Public Housing Policy: Government housing estates scattered throughout the territory disrupt traditional income-based residential patterns

### Expected Patterns vs. Reality:

• Traditional Theory: Burgess and Hoyt models predict clear zones radiating from city center • Hong Kong Reality: Compact geography and efficient public transport create different patterns • Research Gap: Limited studies on how traditional urban models apply to Asian mega-cities with unique geographical constraints**

How do the Urban Characteristics change with distance from Victoria Harbour?

Introduction

Location of study

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a city located in the south of China People's Republic of China. There are few cities bordering Hong Kong, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Macau.

The main focus of this study  is about finding how has the charistis changed form the distance from Vittoria Harbour, and test the hypothesis. To do so,  I decided to start with the steet inside KowLoon, one of the CBDs in Hong Kong. The location we studied is Nathan Road, Yau Tsim Mong District, KowLoon.

Background Theory

Hong Kong is a city with many mountains with less land able to develop. After being colonized by Great Britain, Hong became Financial City instead of industrial city with large number of factories and industry. The Urban model of Hong Kong does not fit the burgess model. The CBD of Hong Kong is Central, however it is not surrounded by factories nor industry. Besides that, the middle class housing is close to the CBD and the working class housing is closer to the factories and industry.

Hypothesis

How do unban characteristics change with distance from victoria harbour, Hong Kong?

1. Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD

I believe that the noise level will decrease with the distance from the CBD because the more distance from the CBD the less accessible the area will be, so there will be less human activities and less noise will be created.

2. EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD

CBD stands for central business district, places away from it will be less economically active since then people will be willing to spend less money to build the architecture so the equity will not be as good as those in CBD.

3. Amount of transport options will decrease with the distance from the CBD

One of the characteristics of CBD is highly accessible, which means that compared to the CBD the places away from it will be less accessible.

Methodology

| Method(s)               | types of data | how we did it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | why we did it                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | links to hypothesis                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Noise (DECIBELS)        | quantitative  | we opened the app that measures the noise level in decibels and walk and stayed in different point and add up all the data then divide them by the amount of members in the group and three because we stay in each points three times (1 min each time) | phone is not a professional device to measure noise level so we are spending more times and take the advantage of each sets of the data which is more accurate compared to use the raw data                                      | the data we received proves the hypothesis that the Noise level will decrease with distance from the CBD                                              |
| ``EQS (rate/10)         | quantitative  | We filled in a survey that included the noise level, hygiene level, building quality, amount of litter, crowding, degree of attraction and facilities quality. And reserved a number between -21 to +21 points                                           | there are many factors to decide the Environmental Quality of an area, though the survey, we would have a clue what is the environmental quality of the area we studied about, and reflexed in the most intuitive way — numbers | the rate/10 reduces while the area we studied went away from the CBD, which linked to the hyphthoes that EQS will decrease with distance from the CBD |
| TRAFFIC OPTIONS (lines) | qualitative   | We walked approximately 30 meters, around the center point of the place we studded and marked down every single traffic options for publics                                                                                                              | This is to show how accessible the area is, by judging how many traffic options are available nearby.                                                                                                                            | This links to the hypothesis of amount of transport options decreasing with distance from the CBD                                                     |
