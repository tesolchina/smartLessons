Subject: Request for Detailed Chat History Data - Goal-Setting Chatbot Study

Dear Junxin,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with accessing more detailed data from our goal-setting chatbot study for research analysis purposes.

Background:
We are currently analyzing the chatbot interaction data from the recent goal-setting study and have encountered some questions that require more granular timestamp information than what is available in the current dataset (final_report_fulfill.xlsx).

Current Analysis Status:
Our preliminary analysis shows that all students appear to have engaged in single-session interactions. To validate this finding and conduct more comprehensive research analysis, we need access to individual chat message timestamps rather than just session-level timestamps.

Data Request:
Could you please help us obtain the following information:

1. Individual message timestamps - The exact time each chat message was sent/received during each student's interaction
2. Session duration data - Start and end times for each user session  
3. Message-level metadata - Any additional logging information that might help us understand the conversation flow

Access Options:
We would appreciate if you could either:

Option 1: Provide the detailed data files directly (preferred format: CSV or Excel with message-level timestamps)

Option 2: Grant us access to check the server directly with appropriate credentials:
- Login: joanniewen@uestc.edu.cn
- Password: 1234asdf

Research Purpose:
This detailed data will enable us to:
- Validate our current findings about single-session usage patterns
- Conduct more sophisticated conversation flow analysis
- Better understand user engagement patterns for our research publication

Timeline:
If possible, we would greatly appreciate having access to this information within the next week to maintain our research timeline.

Thank you very much for your time and assistance. Please let me know if you need any additional information about our research objectives or if there are any technical constraints we should be aware of.

Best regards,
Simon
