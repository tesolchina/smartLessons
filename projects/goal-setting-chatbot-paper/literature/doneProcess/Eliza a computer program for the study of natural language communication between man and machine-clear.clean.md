# ELIZA: A Computer Program For the Study of Natural Language Communication Between Man And Machine

JOSEPH WEIZENBAUM  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass.

ELIZA is a program operating within the MAC time-sharing system at MIT which makes certain kinds of natural language conversation between man and computer possible. Input sentences are analyzed on the basis of decomposition rules which are triggered by key words appearing in the input text. Responses are generated by reassembly rules associated with selected decomposition rules. The fundamental technical problems with which ELIZA is concerned are:

1. The identification of key words
2. The discovery of minimal context
3. The choice of appropriate transformations  
4. Generation of responses in the absence of key words
5. The provision of an editing capability for ELIZA "scripts"

A discussion of some psychological issues relevant to the ELIZA approach as well as of future developments concludes the paper.

## Introduction

It is said that to explain is to explain away. This maxim is nowhere so well fulfilled as in the area of computer programming, especially in what is called heuristic programming and artificial intelligence. For in those realms machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained in language sufficiently plain to induce understanding, its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures, each quite comprehensible. The observer says to himself "I could have written that". With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked "intelligent", to that reserved for curios, fit to be discussed only with people less enlightened than he.

The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be "explained". Few programs ever needed it more.

## ELIZA Program

ELIZA is a program which makes natural language conversation with a computer possible. Its present implementation is on the MAC time-sharing system at MIT. It is written in MAD-SLIP [4] for the IBM 7094. Its name was chosen to emphasize that it may be incrementally improved by its users, since its language abilities may be continually improved by a "teacher". Like the Eliza of Pygmalion fame, it can be made to appear even more civilized, the relation of appearance to reality, however, remaining in the domain of the playwright.

For the present purpose it is sufficient to characterize the MAC system as one which permits an individual to operate a full scale computer from a remotely located typewriter. The individual operator has the illusion that he is the sole user of the computer complex, while in fact others may be "time-sharing" the system with him. What is important here is that the computer can read messages typed on the typewriter and respond by writing on the same instrument. The time between the computer's receipt of a message and the appearance of its response is a function of the program controlling the dialogue and of such MAC system parameters as the number of users currently corresponding with the system. These latter parameters generally contribute so little to the overall response time that conversational interaction with the computer need never involve truly intolerable delays.

When in conversation with ELIZA, the user types in some statement or set of statements in natural language using normal punctuation and sentence structures. Only the question mark may not be used, because it is interpreted as a line delete character by the MAC system. The user's statement is terminated by a double carriage return which serves to turn control over to ELIZA. ELIZA then analyzes the user's statement and generates some response which it types out. Control is then again with the user.

A typical conversation is the following:

Men are all alike.  
IN WHAT WAY

They're always bugging us about something or other.  
CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

Well, my boyfriend made me come here.  
YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE

He says I'm depressed much of the time.  
I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED

The capitalized lines are the machine responses.

The gross procedure of the program is quite simple; the text is read and inspected for the presence of a keyword. If such a word is found, the sentence is transformed according to a rule associated with the keyword. If not, a content-free remark or, under certain conditions, an earlier transformation is retrieved. The text so computed or retrieved is then printed out.

In detail, of course, the procedure sketched above is considerably more complex. Keywords, for example, may have a RANK or precedence number. The procedure is sensitive to such numbers in that it will abandon a keyword already found in the left-to-right scan of the text in favor of one having a higher rank. Also, the procedure recognizes a comma or a period as a delimiter. Whenever either one is encountered and a keyword has already been found, all subsequent text is deleted from the input message. If no key had yet been found the phrase or sentence to the left of the delimiter (as well as the delimiter itself) is deleted. As a result, only single phrases or sentences are ever transformed.

Keywords and their associated transformation rules constitute the SCRIPT for a particular class of conversation. An important property of ELIZA is that a script is data; i.e., it is not part of the program itself. Hence, ELIZA is not restricted to a particular set of recognition patterns or responses, indeed not even to any specific language. ELIZA scripts exist (at this writing) in Welsh and German as well as in English.

The fundamental technical problems with which ELIZA must be preoccupied are the following:

1. The identification of the "most important" keyword occurring in the input message.
2. The identification of some minimal context within which the chosen keyword appears; e.g., if the keyword is "you", is it followed by the word "are" (in which case an assertion is probably being made).
3. The choice of an appropriate transformation rule and, of course, the making of the transformation itself.
4. The provision of mechanism that will permit ELIZA to respond "intelligently" when the input text contained no keywords.
5. The provision of machinery that facilitates editing, particularly extension, of the script on the script writing level.

There are, of course, the usual constraints dictated by the need to be economical in the use of computer time and storage space.

The central issue is clearly one of text manipulation, and at the heart of that issue is the concept of the transformation rule which has been said to be associated with certain keywords. The mechanisms subsumed under the slogan "transformation rule" are a number of SLIP functions which serve to:
1. Decompose a data string according to certain criteria, hence to test the string as to whether it satisfies these criteria or not
2. Reassemble a decomposed string according to certain assembly specifications

While this is not the place to discuss these functions in all their detail (or even to reveal their full power and generality), it is important to the understanding of the operation of ELIZA to describe them in some detail.

Consider the sentence "I am very unhappy these days". Suppose a foreigner with only a limited knowledge of English but with a very good ear heard that sentence spoken but understood only the first two words "I am". Wishing to appear interested, perhaps even sympathetic, he may reply "How long have you been very unhappy these days?" What he must have done is to apply a kind of template to the original sentence, one part of which matched the two words "I am" and the remainder isolated the words "very unhappy these days". He must also have a reassembly kit specifically associated with that template, one that specifies that any sentence of the form "I am BLAH" can be transformed to "How long have you been BLAH", independently of the meaning of BLAH.

A somewhat more complicated example is given by the sentence "It seems that you hate me". Here the foreigner understands only the words "you" and "me"; i.e., he applies a template that decomposes the sentence into the four parts:

1. It seems

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

A formal notation in which to represent the decomposition template is:

(0 YOU 0 ME)

and the reassembly rule:

(WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I 3 YOU)

The "0" in the decomposition rule stands for "an indefinite number of words" (analogous to the indefinite dollar sign of COMIT) [6] while the "3" in the reassembly rule indicates that the third component of the subject decomposition is to be inserted in its place. The decomposition rule:

(0 YOU 1 ME)

would have worked just as well in this specific example. A nonzero integer "n" appearing in a decomposition rule indicates that the component in question should consist of exactly "n" words. However, of the two rules shown, only the first would have matched the sentence, "It seems you hate and love me," the second failing because there is more than one word between "you" and "me".

![Keyword and rule list structure](Fig. 1.)

In ELIZA the question of which decomposition rules to apply to an input text is of course a crucial one. The input sentence might have been, for example, "It seems that you hate," in which case the decomposition rule (0 YOU 0 ME) would have failed in that the word "ME" would not have been found at all, let alone in its assigned place. Some other decomposition rule would then have to be tried and, failing that, still another until a match could be made or a total failure reported. ELIZA must therefore have a mechanism to sharply delimit the set of decomposition rules which are potentially applicable to a currently active input sentence. This is the keyword mechanism.

An input sentence is scanned from left to right. Each word is looked up in a dictionary of keywords. If a word is identified as a keyword, then (apart from the issue of precedence of keywords) only decomposition rules containing that keyword need to be tried. The trial sequence can even be partially ordered. For example, the decomposition rule (0 YOU 0) associated with the keyword "YOU" (and decomposing an input sentence into (1) all words in front of "YOU", (2) the word "YOU", and (3) all words following "YOU") should be the last one tried since it is bound to succeed.

Two problems now arise. One stems from the fact that almost none of the words in any given sentence are represented in the keyword dictionary. The other is that of "associating" both decomposition and reassembly rules with keywords. The first is serious in that the determination that a word is not in a dictionary may well require more computation (i.e., time) than the location of a word which is represented. The attack on both problems begins by placing both a keyword and its associated rules on a list. The basic format of a typical key list is the following:

(K ((D1) (R1,1) (R1,2) ... (R1,m1))
   ((D2) (R2,1) (R2,2) ... (R2,m2))
   :
   ((Dn) (Rn,1) (Rn,2) ... (Rn,mn)))

where K is the keyword, Di the ith decomposition rule associated with K and Ri,j the jth reassembly rule associated with the ith decomposition rule.

A common pictorial representation of such a structure is the tree diagram shown in Figure 1. The top level of this structure contains the keyword followed by the names of lists; each one of which is again a list structure beginning with a decomposition rule and followed by reassembly rules. Since list structures of this type have no predetermined dimensionality limitations, any number of decomposition rules may be associated with a given keyword and any number of reassembly rules with any specific decomposition rule. SLIP is rich in functions that sequence over structures of this type efficiently. Hence programming problems are minimized.

An ELIZA script consists mainly of a set of list structures of the type

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

The actual identification of a keyword leaves as its principal product a pointer to the list of decomposition (and hence reassembly) rules associated with the identified keyword. One result of this strategy is that often less time is required to discover that a given word is not in the keyword dictionary than to locate it if it is there. However, the location of a keyword yields pointers to all information associated with that word.

Some conversational protocols require that certain transformations be made on certain words of the input text independently of any contextual considerations. The first conversation displayed in this paper, for example, requires that first person pronouns be exchanged for second person pronouns and vice versa throughout the input text. There may be further transformations but these minimal substitutions are unconditional. Simple substitution rules ought not to be elevated to the level of transformations, nor should the words involved be forced to carry with them all the structure required for the fully complex case. Furthermore, unconditional substitutions of single words for single words can be accomplished during the text scan itself, not as a transformation of the entire text subsequent to scanning.

To facilitate the realization of these desiderata, any word in the key dictionary, i.e., at the top of a key list structure, may be followed by an equal sign followed by whatever word is to be its substitute. Transformation rules may, but need not, follow. If none do follow such a substitution rule, then the substitution is made on the fly, i.e., during text scanning, but the word in question is not identified as a keyword for subsequent purposes. Of course, a word may be both substituted for and be a keyword as well. An example of a simple substitution is:

(YOURSELF = MYSELF)

Neither "yourself" nor "myself" are keywords in the particular script from which this example was chosen.

The fact that keywords can have ranks or precedences has already been mentioned. The need of a ranking mechanism may be established by an example. Suppose an input sentence is "I know everybody laughed at me." A script may tag the word "I" as well as the word "everybody" as a keyword. Without differential ranking, "I" occurring first would determine the transformation to be applied. A typical response might be "You say you know everybody laughed at you." But the important message in the input sentence begins with the word "everybody". It is very often true that when a person speaks in terms of universals such as "everybody", "always" and "nobody" he is really referring to some quite specific event or person. By giving "everybody" a higher rank than "I", the response "Who in particular are you thinking of" may be generated.

The specific mechanism employed in ranking is that the rank of every keyword encountered (absence of rank implies rank equals 0) is compared with the rank of the highest ranked keyword already seen. If the rank of the new word is higher than that of any previously encountered word, the pointer to the transformation rules associated with the new word is placed on top of a list called the keystack, otherwise it is placed on the bottom of the keystack. When the text scan terminates, the keystack has at its top a pointer associated with the highest ranked keyword encountered in the scan. The remaining pointers in the stack may not be monotonically ordered with respect to the ranks of the words from which they were derived, but they are nearly so—in any event they are in a useful and interesting order.

As an example consider the word "MY" in a particular script. Its keyword list may be as follows:

(MY = YOUR. 5 (transformation rules))

Such a list would mean that whenever the word "MY" is encountered in any text, it would be replaced by the word "YOUR". Its rank would be 5.

Upon completion of a given text scan, the keystack is either empty or contains pointers derived from the keywords found in the text. Each of such pointers is actually a sequence reader—a SLIP mechanism which facilitates scanning of lists—pointing into its particular key list in such a way that one sequencing operation to the right (SEQLR) will sequence it to the first set of transformation rules associated with its

## Transformation Rules and Text Processing

The keyword, say, is "you", and {(D₁), you} is "(0 I remind you of 0)". (Note that the "you" in the original sentence has already been replaced by "I" in the text now analyzed.) This decomposition rule obviously fails to match the input sentence. Should {(D₁), K} fail to find a match, then {(D₂), K} is tried. Should that too fail, {(D₃), K} is attempted, and so on. Of course, the set of transformation rules can be guaranteed to terminate with a decomposition rule which must match. The decomposition rule

(0 K 0)

will match any text in which the word K appears while

(0)

will match any text whatever. However, there are other ways to leave a particular set of transformation rules, as will be shown below. For the present, suppose that some particular decomposition rule (Dᵢ) has matched the input text. (Dᵢ), of course, was found on a list of the form

((Dᵢ)(R₁,₁)(R₂,₁) ... (Rₙ,₁))

Sequencing the reader which is presently pointing at (Dᵢ) will retrieve the reassembly rule (Rₖ,₁) which may then be applied to the decomposed input text to yield the output message.

Consider again the input text:

"You are very helpful"

in which "you" is the only key word. The sentence is transformed during scanning to:

"I are very helpful"

{(D₁), you} is "(0 I remind your of 0)" and fails to match as already discussed. However, {(D₂), you} is "(0 I are 0)" and obviously matches the text, decomposing it into the constituents:

1. empty
2. I
3. are
4. very helpful

{(R₂,₁), you} is "What makes you think I am 4)" Hence it produces the output text:

"What makes you think I am very helpful."

Having produced it, the integer 1 is put in front of (R₂,₁) so that the transformation rule list in question now appears as:

((Dᵢ)1(R₁,₁)(R₂,₁) ... (Rₙ,₁))

Next time {(D₂), K} matches an input text, the reassembly rule (R₂,₂) will be applied and the integer 2 will replace the 1. After (R₂,₂) has been exercised, (R₂,₁) will again be invoked. Thus, after the system has been in use for a time, every decomposition rule which has matched some input text has associated with it an integer which corresponds to the last reassembly rule used in connection with that decomposition rule. This mechanism ensures that the complete set of reassembly rules associated with a given decomposition rule is cycled through before any repetitions occur.

The system described so far is essentially one which selects a decomposition rule for the highest ranking keyword found in an input text, attempts to match that text according to that decomposition rule and, failing to make a match, selects the next reassembly rule associated with the matching decomposition rule and applies it to generate an output text. It is, in other words, a system which, for the highest ranking keyword of a text, selects a specific decomposition and reassembly rule to be used in forming the output message.

Were the system to remain that simple, then keywords that required identical sets of transformation rules would each require that a copy of these transformation rules be associated with them. This would be logically sound but would complicate the task of script writing and would also make unnecessary storage demands. There are therefore special types of decomposition and assembly rules characterized by the

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

The text appears to be from a technical paper about the ELIZA program. I'll clean up the legible portions:

When "you're" is selected as the matching keyword, then the input text is decomposed into three constituent parts, namely, all text in front of the first occurrence of "I'm", the word "I'm" itself, and all text following the first occurrence of "I'm".

The reassembly rule beginning with the code "PRE" is encountered and the decomposed text reassembled such that the words "I AM" appear in front of the third constituent, determined by the earlier decomposition.

Control is transferred to the transformation rules associated with the keyword "you", where further decompositions etc. are attempted.

Another form of reassembly rule is `(NEWKEY)` which serves the case in which attempts to match on the currently regnant keyword are to be given up and the entire decomposition and reassembly process is to start again on the basis of the keyword to be found in the keystack. Whenever this rule is invoked, the top of the keystack is "popped up" once, i.e., the new regnant keyword recovered and removed from the keystack, and the entire process reinitiated as if the initial text scan had just terminated. This mechanism makes it possible to, in effect, test on key phrases as opposed to single key words.

A serious problem which remains to be discussed is the reaction of the system in case no keywords remain to serve as transformation triggers. This can arise either in case the keystack is empty when NEWKEY is invoked or when the input text contained no keywords initially.

The simplest mechanism supplied is in the form of the special reserved keyword "NONE" which must be part of any script. The script writer must associate the universally matching decomposition rule (0) with it and follow this by as many content-free remarks in the form of transformation rules as he pleases. (Examples are: "Please go on", "That's very interesting" and "I see".)

[Rest of text continues with technical details about MEMORY keyword and SLIP text manipulation]

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Finally, the script writer must begin his script with a list, i.e., a message enclosed in parentheses, which contains the statement he wishes ELIZA to type when the system is first loaded. This list may be empty.

Editing of an ELIZA script is achieved via appeal to a contextual editing program (ED) which is part of the MAC library. This program is called whenever the input text to ELIZA consists of the single word "EDIT". ELIZA then puts itself in a so-called dormant state and presents the then stored script for editing. Detailed description of ED is out of place here. Suffice it to say that changes, additions and deletions of the script may be made with considerable efficiency and on the basis of entirely contextual cues, i.e., without resort to line numbers or any other artificial devices. When editing is completed, ED is given the command to FILE the revised script. The new script is then stored on the disk and read into ELIZA. ELIZA then types the word "START" to signal that the conversation may resume under control of the new script.

An important consequence of the editing facility built into ELIZA is that a given ELIZA script need not start out to be a large, full-blown scenario. On the contrary, it should begin as a quite modest set of keywords and transformation rules and permitted to be grown and molded as experience with it builds up. This appears to be the best way to use a truly interactive man-machine facility--i.e., not as a device for rapidly debugging a code representing a fully thought out solution to a problem, but rather as an aid for the exploration of problem solving strategies.

## Discussion

At this writing, the only serious ELIZA scripts which exist are some which cause ELIZA to respond roughly as would certain psychotherapists (Rogerians). ELIZA performs best when its human correspondent is initially instructed to "talk" to it, via the typewriter of course, just as one would to a psychiatrist. This mode of conversation was chosen because the psychiatric interview is one of the few examples of categorized dyadic natural language communication in which one of the participating pair is free to assume the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world. If, for example, one were to tell a psychiatrist "I went for a long boat ride" and he responded "Tell me about boats", one would not assume that he knew nothing about boats, but that he had some purpose in so directing the subsequent conversation. It is important to note that this assumption is one made by the speaker. Whether it is realistic or not is an altogether separate question. In any case, it has a crucial psychological utility in that it serves the speaker to maintain his sense of being heard and understood.

The speaker further defends his impression (which even in real life may be illusory) by attributing to his conversational partner all sorts of background knowledge, insights and reasoning ability. But again, these are the speaker's contribution to the conversation. They manifest themselves inferentially, in the interpretations he makes of the offered responses. From the purely technical programming point of view then, the psychiatric interview form of an ELIZA script has the advantage that it eliminates the need of storing explicit information about the real world.

The human speaker will, as has been said, contribute much to clothe ELIZA's responses in vestments of plausibility. But he will not defend his illusion (that he is being understood) against all odds. In human conversation a speaker will make certain (perhaps generous) assumptions about his conversational partner. As long as it remains possible to interpret

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

A certain danger lurks there. The idea that the present ELIZA script contains no information about the real world is not entirely true. For example, the transformation rules which cause the input:

"Everybody hates me"

to be transformed to:

"Can you think of anyone in particular"

and other such are based on quite specific hypotheses about the world. The whole script constitutes, in a loose way, a model of certain aspects of the world. The act of writing a script is a kind of programming act and has all the advantages of programming, most particularly that it clearly shows where the programmer's understanding and command of his subject leaves off.

A large part of whatever elegance may be credited to ELIZA lies in the fact that ELIZA maintains the illusion of understanding with so little machinery. But there are bounds on the extendability of ELIZA's "understanding" power, which are a function of the ELIZA program itself and not a function of any script it may be given. The crucial test of understanding, as every teacher should know, is not the subject's ability to continue a conversation, but to draw valid conclusions from what he is being told. In order for a computer program to be able to do that, it must at least have the capacity to store selected parts of its inputs. ELIZA throws away each of its inputs, except for those few transformed by means of the MEMORY machinery. Of course, the problem is more than one of storage. A great part of it is, in fact, subsumed under the word "selected" used just above. ELIZA in its use so far has had as one of its principal objectives the concealment of its lack of understanding. But to encourage its conversational partner to offer inputs from which it can select remedial information, it must reveal its misunderstanding. A switch of objectives from the concealment to the revelation of misunderstanding is seen as a precondition to making an ELIZA-like program the basis for an effective natural language man-machine communication system.

One goal for an augmented ELIZA program is thus a system which already has access to a store of information about some aspects of the real world and which, by means of conversational interaction with people, can reveal both what it knows, i.e., behave as an information retrieval system, and where its knowledge ends and needs to be augmented. Hopefully the augmentation of its knowledge will also be a direct consequence of its conversational experience. It is precisely the prospect that such a program will converse with many people and learn something from each of them, which leads to the hope that it will prove an interesting and even useful conversational partner.

One way to state a slightly different intermediate goal is to say that ELIZA should be given the power to slowly build a model of the subject conversing with it. If the subject mentions that he is not married, for example, and later speaks of his wife, then ELIZA should be able to make the tentative inference that he is either a widower or divorced. Of course, he could simply be confused. In the long run, ELIZA should be able to build up a belief structure (to use Abelson's phrase) of the subject and on that basis detect the subject's rationalizations, contradictions, etc. Conversations with such an ELIZA would often turn into arguments. Important steps in the realization of these goals have already been taken. Most notable among these is Abelson's and Carroll's work on simulation of belief structures [1].

The script that has formed the basis for most of this discussion happens to be one with an overwhelmingly psychological orientation. The reason for this has already been discussed. There is a danger, however, that the example will run away with what it is supposed to illustrate. It is useful to remember that the ELIZA program itself is merely a translating processor in the technical programming sense. Gorn [2] in a paper on language systems says:

> Given a language which already possesses semantic content, then a translating processor, even if it operates only syntactically, generates corresponding expressions of another language to which we can attribute as "meanings" (possibly multiple--the translator

## Comments on a Problem in Concurrent Programming Control

Dear Editor:

I would like to comment on Mr. Dijkstra's solution [Solution of a problem in concurrent programming control. Comm ACM 8 (Sept. 1965), 569] to a messy problem that is hardly academic. We are using it now on a multiple computer complex.

When there are only two computers, the algorithm may be simplified to the following:

```
Boolean array b[0:1]
integer k, i, j

comment This is the program for computer i, which may be 
either 0 or 1, computer j ≠ i is the other one, 1 or 0;

C0: b(i) := false;
C1: if k = i then begin
C2:   if not b(j) then go to C2;
      else k := i;
      go to C1 end;
    else critical section;
    b(i) := true;
    remainder of program;
    go to C0;
end
```

Mr. Dijkstra has come up with a clever solution to a really practical problem.
