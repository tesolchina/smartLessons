The effects of goal setting and self-monitoring during self-regulated practice on the acquisition of a novel motoric skill were studied with 50 high school girls. It was hypothesized that process goals would improve not only the development of dart throwing skill more than product goals but also self-efficacy perceptions, self-reactions and intrinsic interest. It was also expected that self-recording, a formal form of self-monitoring, would similarly enhance dart throwing skill, self-efficacy and self-reactive beliefs. Support for both hypotheses was found. Path analyses revealed that goal setting had a larger impact than self-recording on dart throwing skill, however, self-recording influenced self-efficacy beliefs and positive self-reactions as well as skill acquisition. The girls' self-reactions to dart throwing outcomes were highly correlated with their intrinsic interest in the task. The results are discussed in terms of a social cognitive view of self-regulatory processes in the acquisition and optimal performance of an athletic skill.

Over the last decade, considerable research in non-athletic settings has focused on the impact of self-regulated learning processes and beliefs on students' academic performance (e.g., Bandura, 1993; Schunk & Zimmerman, 1994; Zimmerman & Schunk, 1989). Self-regulated learning refers to self-generated thoughts, feelings, and actions that are systematically designed to influence one's acquisition of knowledge and skill (Zimmerman, 1989). The present study focuses on the effectiveness of two important self-regulatory processes in academic learning, goal setting and self-monitoring, with students who are attempting to acquire a novel motoric skill when practicing by themselves. It is hypothesized that qualitative differences in students' goals and methods of self-monitoring will not only influence their self-directed acquisition but also their self-perceptions and intrinsic interest in continuing their mastery of the motoric skill.

Goals refer to intentions to attain a specific standard of proficiency, usually within a specified time limit (Locke, Shaw, Saari, & Latham, 1981). According to Locke and colleagues (1985, 1990) goal setting influences behavioral functioning by focusing attention and regulating one's expenditure of effort. Self-monitoring refers to "the process of discriminating target behaviors and related events" (Kirschenbaum, 1984) and as, "deliberate attention to some aspect of one's behavior" (Schunk, 1983). Self-monitoring requires learners to attend selectively to specific actions and cognitive processes, to distinguish them from others, and to discriminate their outcomes. Self-recording is a formal form of self-monitoring that has been used widely in research on human self-regulation (Watson & Tharp, 1993). Because goal setting sets the stage for effective self-monitoring by providing the basis for selective observation, these two self-regulatory processes complement each other.

There has been a growing interest in studying the impact of goal setting and self-monitoring in the acquisition of motoric skills. Several studies have found that self-monitoring enhanced performance of non-elite sport participants, and it was confirmed that elite athletes used self-monitoring to improve their skills (Whelan, Mahoney, & Meyers, 1991; Kirschenbaum, Ordman, Tomarken, & Holtzbauer, 1982; Kingery, 1990). In goal setting research on motoric performance, the goal properties of specificity, difficulty and proximity have been studied (Locke, 1990, 1991; Ferrari, Pinard, Reid, & Bouffard-Bouchard, 1991). Although specific, difficult and proximal goals have been found to enhance athletic and exercise performance, the results have not been as consistent as in the academic education literature (Locke, 1991). But a recent survey of college athletes revealed that higher ability students

## Effects of Process and Product Goals in Motoric Learning

Although process and product goals have been studied extensively, researchers have given much less attention to the effects of process goals, which focus on cognitive-motor techniques.

The relative effects of process and product goals have been studied recently with academic learning tasks. Process goals refer to methods and strategies that can help students to master a particular task, whereas product goals specify the outcomes of learning efforts. Schunk and Swartz (1993) hypothesized that process goals would be more effective than product goals because they focus learners directly on emulating previously validated learning strategies. In contrast, product goals shift learners' attention away from strategic means to task outcomes.

Learning strategies (Weinstein & Mayer, 1986) are powerful yet parsimonious ways to encode information designed to optimize performance, such as rules, images, and self-verbalizations. Complex tasks, such as writing, have many facets that easily overwhelm novice learners, and strategies enable them to focus on key facets that are essential to success. Experts continue to rely on strategies whenever their performance becomes deficient—for example, when a writer experiencing a "mental block" skips the difficult section of a manuscript to focus on an easier one.

Schunk and Swartz taught fifth grade students to write short essays through the use of a multi-step strategy. As the students practiced their writing, some focused on performing each step, whereas others focused on producing the strategic outcome of higher quality writing. This study did not involve self-recording, but the experimenter did provide progress feedback (i.e., linking the strategy with improved writing performance) to some students in the strategic process group.

The results revealed that students with a process goal (regardless of feedback) exhibited higher writing skills than students given a product goal or a general goal. However, only process goal students who were given progress feedback displayed greater posttest self-efficacy than students having a product goal or a general goal. Self-efficacy refers to personal beliefs about one's capabilities to learn or perform skills at designated levels (Bandura, 1986). Self-efficacy beliefs motivate students to apply the skill on their own (Bandura & Schunk, 1981; Schunk, 1989; Zimmerman, 1985; 1995).

According to a social cognitive view of self-regulation (Zimmerman, 1989), student perceptions of self-efficacy depend directly on a performance feedback loop, and the results of Schunk and Swartz provide support for this hypothesis. The relationship between self-efficacy beliefs and process goal setting has received relatively little attention in prior research on motoric learning.

Although process and product goals are distinctive, they are related functionally also. Attempts by novice learners to focus simultaneously on the means and ends of learning divides their attention. Information processing theorists (Carver & Scheier, 1981) have shown that after motoric elements of a complex skill become automatized or routinized, learners can shift their cognitive focus to other issues with fewer adverse consequences. In view of this, Zimmerman and colleagues (Zimmerman, 1994; Zimmerman & Bonner, in press) have proposed a developmental sequence of skill mastery in which process goals precede product or outcome goals.

Process goals should be more effective as learners begin to practice on their own, whereas product goals should assist learners later when they are adapting their routinized performance skills to dynamic naturalistic conditions. Thus, a tennis player should concentrate first on mastery of various elements of a service motion before focusing on their effectiveness. Concentration on tennis outcomes before their linkage to essential form components is understood could impair development. However, after this process-outcome linkage is internalized cognitively, learners can benefit from setting specific outcome goals.

An alternative perspective on the effectiveness of process goals has been discussed by Singer, Lidor, and Cauraugh (1993). They hypothesized that in order to achieve the automaticity of motoric process reported by expert performers, novice learners should adopt a nonawareness strategy instead of an

## Goal Setting and Self-Monitoring

## Method

### Subjects

The subjects were 50 girls from four ninth and tenth grade physical education classes of a parochial all-girls school. This female population was selected because very few of these young women had any previous experience with dart throwing. They ranged in age from 14-16 years with a mean age of 15.8 years, and they came from predominantly middle class families. Their ethnic composition was diverse: There were 25 Americans of European extraction, 5 African-Americans, 11 Hispanic-Americans, and 9 Asian-Americans. One girl who had previous dart throwing experience was excluded. In addition, two subjects were excluded because they had trouble following the experimenter's instructions. All subjects received a certificate for their participation in the experiment.

### Task Materials

The dart throwing game involved six darts, which were steel-headed and plastic-feathered, and a wooden framed target board made up of 7 regular concentric circles. The bull's eye had a radius of 1/2 inch, and each succeeding circle increased in radius by one inch. Each zone or circle was assigned a numerical value, beginning with a center value of 7 and successively diminishing in assigned values by one until the outermost circle has a value of one. The target was positioned with its uppermost edge 5.8 feet high, and all darts were thrown from a distance of 8.5 feet from the target.

### Measures

#### Dart-throwing Skill
A test was designed to determine the dart throwing skill level of each participant. After receiving instructions in throwing and scoring (see procedures section), the girls were told to "do their best" and were given six darts to throw. Each person's final score represented the average for six throws and thus could range between 0 and 7 points.

#### Self-efficacy Scale
A measure of self-efficacy for dart throwing was developed for use in this study following procedures outlined by Bandura and Schunk (1981). The self-efficacy measure included items regarding the subjects' capability to throw darts. All items were introduced with the phrase "How sure are you that you can score at least..." followed by these phrases:
1. ...7 with one dart
2. ...5 with one dart
3. ...3 with one dart
4. ...1 with one dart

The subjects responded using an efficacy scale that ranged from 0 to 100 points in 10 unit intervals. Written descriptions were presented for the following points of the scale: 10 (not sure), 40 (somewhat sure), 70 (pretty sure), and 100 (very sure). Each girl's score was composed of the average self-efficacy rating for the four items. The inter-item reliability of the four self-efficacy questions was .89 according to Cronbach's alpha test.

#### Self-reaction Scale
The girls' satisfaction with their dart throwing proficiency was also assessed with single item scale that ranged from 0 to 100 in 10 unit intervals. Written labels were offered for the following points: 10 (not satisfied), 40 (somewhat satisfied), 70 (pretty satisfied) and 100 (very satisfied). Each participant's score indicated how satisfied she was about her overall performance.

#### Intrinsic Interest Scale
The young women were asked to rank their preference for dart throwing in comparison with four other sports, namely volleyball, soccer, tumbling, and apparatus gymnastics. The other sports were selected from a list of those that had been studied as part of the regular gym classes and thus were familiar to all of the girls without having been self-selected. The rank of 1 represented the least favored sport ranging to 5 for their favorite sport. Each girl's score was determined by her ranking of dart throwing.

### Design and Procedure

The girls from four physical education classes were asked to participate in a study of dart throwing, and all agreed. The 50 subjects were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions or a no-practice control group, and thus there

## Goal Setting and Self-Monitoring Study

## Methods

Experimental subjects were given 12 minutes to practice dart throwing, with equal practice time but varying throwing trials. The operational definitions for each goal type were:

- Product goal condition: Subjects were instructed to attain the highest numeric score (0-7) during practice. Those in the self-recording subgroup wrote their scores in a log after each trial (3 throws).

- Process goal condition: Subjects were told to concentrate on properly executing three steps in every throw:
  1. Sighting
  2. Throwing  
  3. Follow through
  Those in the self-recording subgroup logged any missed steps after each trial.

After practice, all experimental groups were posttested for dart throwing proficiency, self-efficacy, self-reaction, and intrinsic interest. The control group received initial instructions and posttesting without practice.

## Results

### Factorial Analyses

The data for each dependent measure were analyzed using a 2 (goal setting) × 2 (self-recording) factorial ANOVA. Table 1 displays means and standard deviations for all measures.

For dart throwing skill:
- Significant main effect for goal setting, F(1, 36) = 82.17, p < .001
- Significant main effect for self-recording F(1, 36) = 9.58, p < .004
- No significant interaction
- Process goals (M = 4.76) surpassed product goals (M = 3.39)
- Self-recording (M = 4.31) surpassed no self-recording (M = 3.84)

For self-efficacy:
- Significant main effect for goal setting F(1, 36) = 5.29, p < .03
- Significant main effect for self-recording F(1, 36) = 6.22, p < .02
- No significant interaction
- Process goals (M = 61.50) exceeded product goals (M = 52.63)
- Self-recording (M = 61.88) exceeded no self-recording (M = 52.25)

For self-reactions:
- Significant main effect for goal setting F(1, 36) = 7.55, p < .009
- Significant main effect for self-recording F(1, 36) = 11.13, p < .002
- Near-significant interaction F(1, 36) = 3.854, p = .06
- Process goals (M = 66.50) showed greater satisfaction than product goals (M = 52.50)
- Self-recording (M = 68.00) showed greater satisfaction than no self-recording (M = 51.00)

For intrinsic interest:
- Significant main effect for goal setting F(1, 36) = 5.68, p < .03
- No significant main effect for self-recording
- No significant interaction
- Process goals (M = 3.60) preferred more than product goals (M = 2.80)

T-tests between control and no self-recording product goal groups showed higher dart throwing skills in the latter (M = 3.03 vs M = 2.40), t(10) = -3.32, p < .004, but no other significant differences.

## Goal Setting and Self-Monitoring Study

## Results

### Path Analysis
Path analysis was conducted for treated subjects examining motoric skill and self-regulatory belief measures. Data from the control group were excluded from these causal analyses. Figure 1 shows the path analysis results, with all coefficients being statistically significant. R represents the multiple correlation for each endogenous variable.

Spearman correlations among the variables are reported in Table 2, including correlations with intrinsic interest. Girls' satisfaction with their dart throwing skill (self-reaction) correlated more highly (r = .75) with posttest intrinsic interest than with dart-throwing skill (r = .49).

### Statistical Model Fit
The model fit was confirmed with chi-square(3) = 2.65, p < .45, indicating no statistically significant paths were omitted. Key findings:

- Goal setting was a stronger predictor of dart throwing skill than self-recording
- Self-recording linked directly to dart throwing and both self-regulatory beliefs (self-efficacy and self-reactions)
- Indirect effect of goal setting via improved dart-throwing skill was .34 for self-efficacy and .38 for self-reaction
- Dart throwing skill and self-recording accounted for 28% of self-efficacy (R² = .23) and 31% of self-reactions (R² = .31)
- Goal setting and self-recording accounted for 71% of dart throwing proficiency (R² = .71)

## Discussion

Despite identical strategy training across experimental groups, girls who adopted process goals showed greater success in acquiring the novel motoric skill compared to those with product goals. Self-recording also significantly enhanced dart throwing skill development. The factorial analyses showed additive effects of goal setting and self-recording, with each self-regulatory technique contributing separately to dart throwing mastery.

This evidence suggests parallels between goal setting effects in academic tasks (like writing) and athletic motor tasks (like dart throwing). The impact of goal setting on posttest self-efficacy was evident even without external progress feedback or self-recording. While those without formal self-recording may have used informal self-monitoring (like selective attention and covert verbal tracking), formal self-monitoring through record-keeping proved more effective, suggesting self-monitoring is vital for self-regulated motoric learning.

## Goal Setting and Self-Monitoring

## Research Design Considerations

An important dimension of self-monitoring is the amount of change observed during learning. The decision to self-monitor process errors was based on change criteria rather than value criteria, as pilot testing showed learners rapidly overcame dart throwing process errors. From a learning perspective, self-monitoring of processing errors focused learners on motoric components needing correction, whereas monitoring successes would have diverted attention to components not requiring attention.

Analysis of the girls' self-recording revealed disparities in change when recording errors versus product successes. From the first to second half of practice trials:
- Product goal group improved successes from 2.72 to 2.78 points per throw
- Process group reduced errors from 1.56 to 0.98 per throw

The amount of change appeared to outweigh outcome value motivationally - perceptions of self-efficacy and self-reactions were significantly higher for girls monitoring process outcomes versus product outcomes.

## Control Group Design

The researchers initially planned to include a practiced control group but pilot testing revealed girls given only a general goal often spontaneously adopted product goals. This undermined the intended non-specific goal control function. Therefore, an unpracticed control group was used to provide a less ambiguous baseline measure of dart throwing skill.

Supporting this decision:
- Pilot study practiced control group (M = 2.95) was statistically comparable to product goal-no recording group (M = 3.03)
- Both were significantly higher than no practice control group (M = 2.40)

This evidence of learners infusing vague goals with specific intentions supports Weinberg et al.'s (1993) contention that spontaneous goal setting among control groups has contributed to inconsistent relations between goal setting and performance outcomes in sport.

## Path Analysis Results

Path analyses revealed:
- Process goals directly improved dart throwing skill acquisition but not self-reactions and self-efficacy
- Goal setting influenced self-reactions and self-efficacy indirectly via improved skills
- Self-recording directly enhanced self-reactions and self-efficacy but had less impact on performance

The motivational importance of performance reactions was evident in high positive correlations between self-reactions and intrinsic interest in dart-throwing. Many self-recording participants spontaneously expressed pleasure with their performance and plans to continue the activity.

## Theoretical Implications

Several theorists argue that intrinsic motivation is vital for competence development, especially for self-directed skills. Notably, intrinsic interest correlated more strongly with self-reactions than dart-throwing skill. This suggests instructors should not assume skill improvements automatically motivate self-directed learning - systematic self-monitoring procedures can substantially improve student motivation and learning.

While self-efficacy correlated significantly with self-reactions, it did not significantly predict intrinsic interest. This may relate to the verbal preference measure used rather than direct task engagement measures employed in prior research where self-efficacy was predictive. Future research should include both actual engagement and verbal rankings.

The results align with developmental skill mastery analysis. Process goals were more effective for novice independent learners, distinguishing this study from most sport/exercise goal setting research focused on improving performance in those with established motoric techniques.

## Goal Setting and Self-Monitoring

ZIMMERMAN AND KITSANTAS

goal achievement strategy, which is an optimal way for achieving performance and outcome goals. We concur with his conclusion that often goals are properly set but never accomplished because athletes fail to include goal achievement strategies. The strategic process approach in the present study focuses the learner on strategy acquisition before concentrating on performance goals.

Process goals in the present study enhanced not only skill acquisition but also several closely linked psychological processes, namely the learners' self-perceptions, beliefs, and motivation. There was not only consistency across these multi-process findings but also a coherent pattern of causality among them. These positive results of process goals appear to conflict with the conclusions of Singer et al. (1993) about the liabilities of awareness when executing motor skills. However, when analyzed closely, these differences can be explained on the basis of variations in operational definition and interpretation. In that study, the nonawareness strategy involved preplanning the motoric process and focusing on a single "context" cue during execution and excluding all others. Most goal theorists (Locke et al., 1981; Gould, 1993) stress the need to prioritize goals and focus on accomplishing the one or two that are most important. When these goals are achieved, athletes then focus on the next prioritized goals. Thus, there appears to be no disagreement about mentally preparing motoric processes before execution or the need to focus one's attention during motoric execution. There is also no dispute about executing a response as a singular uninterrupted action. The only point of contention appears to be whether the "context cue" can have motoric process implications and whether it is important to change the focus cue as various components of a motoric sequence are mastered. It should also be noted that Singer et al. also studied a preferred five-step approach to learning that incorporated two additional process components: mental imagery and self-evaluation. Interestingly, this approach produced statistically comparable results to the nonawareness strategy in their research. Thus, what seems to be major differences in approach to learning process issues between our study and that of Singer et al. appear under closer scrutiny to be relatively small.

There are additional advantages for athletes who set strategic process goals during acquisition of a new skill. These goals not only focus a learner's attention on form or stylistic elements of an athletic skill, they also enhance the type of attributions and resulting adjustments that learners make. A process goal prompts one to attribute poor outcomes to improper strategy use rather than to a lack of native ability or to insufficient effort. These strategy attributions have the advantage of preserving one's personal satisfaction and sense of self-efficacy to eventually master the skill (Zimmerman & Martinez-Pons, 1992). The present factorial results provide support for this interpretation: Girls who set strategic process goals not only displayed more positive self-reactions to their learning outcomes but also greater self-efficacy regarding future learning than girls who set product goals.

In conclusion, although the results of the present study regarding the role of functional goals and self-recording in the acquisition of an athletic skill are encouraging, longer term developmental studies are needed that examine self-regulatory processes underlying the adaptive use of a skill. If the form and effectiveness of self-regulatory processes do change during the course of mastery, this information will be vital for instructors and learners to know.
