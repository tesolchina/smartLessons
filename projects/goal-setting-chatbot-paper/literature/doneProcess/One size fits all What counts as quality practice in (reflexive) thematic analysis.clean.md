## Abstract

Developing a universal quality standard for thematic analysis (TA) is complicated by the existence of numerous iterations of TA that differ paradigmatically, philosophically and procedurally. This plurality in TA is often not recognised by editors, reviewers or authors, who promote 'coding reliability measures' as universal requirements of quality TA. Focusing particularly on our reflexive TA approach, we discuss quality in TA with reference to ten common problems we have identified in published TA research that cites or claims to follow our guidance. Many of the common problems are underpinned by an assumption of homogeneity in TA. We end by outlining guidelines for reviewers and editors – in the form of twenty critical questions – to support them in promoting high(er) standards in TA research, and more deliberative and reflexive engagement with TA as method and practice.

## Quality in thematic analysis: what matters?

"The authors should discuss how they attempted to avoid bias in their analytic process."

We received this comment in an anonymous review of an empirical paper we had submitted to a specialist qualitative journal, and in which we used our reflexive thematic analysis (TA) approach, which we first outlined in this journal in 2006 (Braun and Clarke 2006). The reviewer's command reflects a number of problematic assumptions around TA, and indeed qualitative quality criteria, which we contextualise, unpack and expand on in this paper. As the use of TA has expanded, and diversified, since the publication of that paper, the coherence and integrity of published research does not always hold. We use ten problematic practices and assumptions evident in published TA as a tool for thinking about quality in TA, and to support scholars in doing excellent, cohesive TA. These problematic practices reflect confusions and misconceptions about TA that we seek to clarify with clear 'take away' recommendations for quality TA (some of which may apply to qualitative scholarship more broadly, and thus have relevance beyond TA). In order to support editors and reviewers in their role as quality custodians, we translate these problematic, and corresponding good (or best), practices into 'guidelines' for assessing the quality of TA research – presented in the form of twenty critical questions to consider when evaluating TA research for publication (see Table 1 towards the end of the paper).

The problems we commonly encounter in published TA often seem to reflect little to no engagement with the theoretical and philosophical assumptions that underlie procedures, with wider quality discussions in qualitative research (e.g. Levitt et al. 2018; Madill et al., 2000; Sparks & Smith, 2009; Yardley 2015), or indeed nuanced, aware and situated application of quality criteria. As TA is used within positivist/quantitative and qualitative paradigms, and different types of TA are embedded within, and reflect, different conceptualisations of qualitative research, articulating 'universal' quality standards and criteria for TA is challenging. We find Kidder and Fine's (1987) distinction between small q and Big Q qualitative research useful for demarcating between qualitative positivism (small q), the use of qualitative techniques of data collection and analysis within a positivist paradigm, and the use of qualitative techniques within a qualitative paradigm (Big Q qualitative). The values of these paradigms are in more or less tension, and without awareness of this tension, published TA research can exemplify what one of our TA co

## Thematic Analysis: A Brief Contextualizing Introduction

Although there has been discussion as to whether TA is a distinct method, or a generic set of analytic procedures (e.g. Boyatzis 1998; Willig 2013), TA does – we believe – offer a distinct way of working with qualitative data, and that, although it shares some features in common with other approaches that seek to identify 'patterns' in data (e.g., grounded theory, interpretative phenomenological analysis [IPA] or qualitative content analysis), it is nonetheless a method (or cluster of methods) in its own right.

## (Reflexive) Thematic Analysis: A Brief Contextualizing Introduction

Our aim, when we first wrote about TA (Braun and Clarke 2006), was to articulate an approach to TA that reflected, and was compatible with, the assumptions of a qualitative paradigm (Braun and Clarke 2019a). This aim has been developed in a qualitative research textbook (Braun and Clarke 2013), numerous chapters (Braun and Clarke 2012; Braun Clarke and Rance 2014; Braun Clarke and Terry 2015; Braun Clarke and Weate 2016; Braun et al. 2019a; Clarke and Braun 2016; Clarke, Braun, and Hayfield 2015; Terry et al. 2017), encyclopaedia entries (Clarke and Braun 2014a, 2014b), commentaries (Braun and Clarke 2016, 2019a, 2019b, 2019c; Clarke and Braun 2018) and editorials about TA (e.g. Braun and Clarke 2014; Clarke and Braun 2017).

Through this writing, developing a TA website[^1], and teaching, our understanding of the (evolving) landscape of TA (as we see it) has deepened, as has our clarification of where our approach 'fits,' and what elements are most vital to quality (reflexive) TA, and why. In recent publications, we have more carefully articulated the assumptions and values around qualitative research that inform our approach to TA (e.g. Braun and Clarke 2019a) to demarcate what is distinct and different about our approach (e.g. Braun and Clarke 2019c; Braun et al. 2019a). We now call this approach reflexive TA (see Braun and Clarke 2019a, 2019b; Braun et al. 2019a; Terry et al. 2017). This not only demarcates it as a particular TA approach, it emphasises the importance of the researcher's subjectivity as analytic resource, and their reflexive engagement with theory, data and interpretation.

Our original paper sought to provide accessible guidance for TA research that retained flexibility. We emphasised the range of possibilities of different modes of engagement, and our aim was to open-up, rather than close-down, possibilities for TA research, encouraging creativity and wide-ranging use. We partly agree with Potter's (1997) claim that qualitative analysis is a 'craft skill', and something ideally learnt at the feet of 'master', something difficult to fully capture through descriptions of analytic procedures. However, one of us is a keen crafter, and we know craft skills can be formulised for teaching to some extent.

Some structured scaffolding can introduce concepts and teach skills to those who do not intuitively just 'get it', who are not the proverbial ducks-to-water. In writing about TA, we have sought to provide such scaffolding to learn these skills. This is especially important for democratising access to qualitative methods, as not everyone is fortunate or privileged enough to have access to a 'master' qualitative analyst. Interest in qualitative research far exceeds the availability of supervisors and remains often

## Evidence and Themes in Research

Evidence for themes identified in previous research broadly (and more commonly) often means using existing political or explanatory theory – such as attachment theory (Willcox, Moller, and Clarke 2019) or Foucault's theory of sexual ethics (Beres and Farvid 2010) – as a lens through which data are coded and interpreted.

Variation also occurs through coding focus, where meaning can be explored across a spectrum from the semantic (surface, obvious, overt) to the latent (implicit, underlying, 'hidden'). Within reflexive TA, the coding process is integral to theme development, in the sense that themes are an 'outcome' of these coding and theme development processes, are developed through coding; coding is not – in general – a process for finding evidence for pre-conceptualised themes. The analytic process involves immersion in the data, reading, reflecting, questioning, imagining, wondering, writing, retreating, returning. It is far from mechanical and is a process that requires 'headspace' and time for inspiration to strike and insight to develop (Gough and Lyons 2016).

Ho, Chiang, and Leung (2017) provide a vivid example of this process of 'dwelling with' data, and of 'continuously and rigorously reflect[ing] on their own taken for granted thinking' (p. 1760) when researching the experiences of foreign domestic helpers (FDHs) working in Hong Kong, using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to TA. Ho documents his wondering about unspoken meaning behind the words spoken by participants, reflecting on his personal experiences of hiring FDHs and working as a junior nurse, imagining and questioning how he would feel in situations described and experienced by participants, following insights, looking for instances of similar or contrary language and experiences in the data, and pondering these.

## Ten Common Problems in Published TA Research

There are some differences between this brief account of (reflexive) TA, and that in our 2006 paper (for discussion of how our thinking has evolved and what has changed, see Braun and Clarke 2019a, 2019b; Braun et al. 2019a). Our failure to fully articulate the assumptions informing our approach to TA, and how our approach differs from the other approaches we cited (e.g. Boyatzis 1998), undoubtedly contributes to the confusions and misconceptions apparent in some TA research.

### Problem One: Assuming TA is One Approach

As previously noted, TA refers not to a singular approach, but rather to a cluster of sometimes conflicting approaches, divergent both in procedure and underlying philosophy, but which share an interest in capturing patterns in data. We cluster the approaches into what we call 'coding reliability', 'codebook' and 'reflexive' variations (Braun et al. 2019a):

- 'Coding reliability' TA captures neopositivist approaches that have at their core concerns about 'objective' and 'unbiased' coding. The use of a codebook for the analytic process, and multiple coders, is key to ensuring 'accurate' and 'reliable' coding.

- 'Codebook' TA captures a cluster of methods that broadly sit within a qualitative paradigm (albeit with some pragmatic compromises). They use some kind of structured coding framework for developing and documenting the analysis.

- 'Reflexive' TA captures approaches that fully embrace qualitative research values and the subjective skills the researcher brings to the process – a research team is not required or even desirable for quality.

## Thematic Analysis Approaches and Quality Standards

## Different Approaches to Thematic Analysis

Thematic Analysis (TA) is often mistakenly treated as a single, uniform approach. For instance, Firmin et al. (2008) referred to "traditional thematic analysis" (p. 202) as if it were singular and widely understood, while describing an inductive version similar to modified grounded theory. Researchers frequently cite multiple, conceptually incompatible approaches without specifying their actual analytical process.

## Quality Standards and Coding Reliability

Connected to this "one approach" conceptualization is a "one quality standard" criterion. Quality standards often focus on "coding reliability" approaches (e.g., Boyatzis 1998; Guest, MacQueen, and Namey 2012; Joffe 2012), which have the longest history and share similarities with qualitative content analysis.

Boyatzis (1998) proposed TA as a bridge between positivist and interpretative paradigms by combining qualitative data analysis with positivist quality markers:
- Reliability of measurement
- Containing researcher "bias" through standardized coding
- Demonstrating consensus among multiple coders

However, these quality markers don't apply universally to all forms of TA. The logic, process, and quality measures for coding reliability TA differ significantly from reflexive TA. Qualitative research approaches should be evaluated on their own terms (Madill et al., 2000; Sparkes and Smith 2009; Yardley 2015).

## Coding Reliability vs. Reflexive Approaches

Coding reliability approaches differ from reflexive TA in several ways:
- Early theme development
- Use of structured, fixed codebooks
- Multiple independent coders
- Measurement of inter-rater reliability
- Determination of final coding through consensus

In reflexive TA, demonstrating coding reliability and avoiding "bias" is illogical because:
- Meaning and knowledge are situated and contextual
- Researcher subjectivity is a resource for knowledge production
- Subjectivity inevitably shapes knowledge produced

## Codebook Approaches

Between coding reliability and reflexive approaches lie "codebook" approaches, including:
- Framework analysis
- Matrix analysis
- Template analysis

These approaches combine elements of both poles:
- Early theme development and structured codebooks (like coding reliability)
- Recognition of researcher subjectivity and contextual knowledge (like reflexive TA)

Codebook approaches often demonstrate qualitative pragmatism, working well for applied research, particularly in social policy contexts.

## Conclusion

"TA" functions as an umbrella term for approaches sharing some characteristics but differing in paradigmatic values and procedures. Researchers should:
- Clearly specify which TA approach they're using
- Justify use of different criteria and practices when drawing from multiple approaches
- Understand paradigm distinctions between TA versions

## Common Problems in Thematic Analysis

## Problem Two: Citing Without Reading

Unfortunately, this problem is not a joke. Some citations of our 2006 paper appear performative: dropped in as a 'convenient' or maybe even 'required' citation. Numerous authors claim to have 'followed the procedures outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006),' then describe procedures with little or no resemblance to those we outlined. For example, Kaye, Wall, and Malone (2016) described their approach as TA and their procedure as 'in line with Braun and Clarke (2006) analytic strategy' (p. 464), but then outlined an analytic process more akin to coding reliability TA: the data were read by 'two naïve coders'; each coder independently identified initial themes; the data were coded to test the validity of the initial themes (in part to determine the frequency of each theme); the data were reviewed again alongside the development of a codebook. Reading such papers, we have discovered that we promote the use of codebooks and coding frames, consensus coding, the measurement of coding reliability, developing themes before data coding, data or theme saturation, the measurement and reporting of theme frequency, constant comparative analysis, and more . . . Reader, we do not! Not only are these things we have not said, they are all things we are indeed critical of, as practices for Big Q qualitative inquiry (Braun and Clarke 2013, 2019c; Clarke and Braun 2019).

The take away . . . Do your homework – by which we mean, do not cite us (or indeed any other TA author) as the method used for TA without:
- reading the methodological guidelines provided
- confirming that what you did is what is advocated
- being clear on why any 'deviations' from the broad approach were adopted

## Problem Three: Unjustified or Incompatible 'Mash-ups'

There are numerous instances of problematic practice that go beyond researchers citing multiple (incompatible) sources for TA, effectively combining reflexive TA with other often incompatible procedures without justification or explanation. The notion of methodological 'mash-ups' is not problematic per se; the flexibility of TA invites such creativity and innovation. Our concern is with seemingly unknowing and unreflexive mash-ups that result in theoretical and conceptual incoherence – 'confused q' research.

For example, the combination of reflexive TA with the use of codebooks and coding reliability measures is common, but the tensions between the organic and subjective coding processes of reflexive TA and concerns for coding accuracy and reliability seem to be far less commonly recognised – certainly they are not often discussed. Some researchers also use concepts and terminology distinctively associated with other analytic approaches (e.g. the terms emergent and superordinate theme, associated with IPA; the grounded theory concepts of constant comparative analysis, line-by-line coding and saturation; see Braun and Clarke 2019c, for a critical discussion of the use of the saturation concept in TA) without discussion of the located and particular meanings, or theoretical anchors, associated with these concepts and practices.

The take away . . . Methodological mash-ups should be warranted, justified and theoretically coherent, and based in a full understanding of what (reflexive) TA can – and cannot – offer.

## Problem Four: Assuming TA is Atheoretical

The theoretical flexibility of TA, the absence of inbuilt guiding theory, is where TA departs from other popular and well-utilised qualitative analytic approaches such as IPA, grounded theory, discourse analysis and narrative analysis. Some of these approaches offer a range of theoretical possibilities through the proliferation of different iterations of the original approach (e.g. there are various 'flavours' of grounded theory – positivist, contextualist/constructivist and radical constructionist are all discussed; see Charmaz and Henwood 2008; Glaser 1

## Problems and Possibilities in Thematic Analysis

## Theoretical Assumptions and Implications

Researchers should always reflect on and specify the philosophical and theoretical assumptions informing their use of TA, even inductive TA. TA should be recognized as a (more or less, depending on the specific iteration) theoretically flexible, but not atheoretical, approach and one equally suited to experiential and critical orientations for qualitative research (TA is often assumed to be only appropriate to use in experiential orientations, a Problem we now discuss).

## Problem Five: Assuming TA is Only Realist/Essentialist or Experiential/Phenomenological

Closely connected to Problem four, TA is regularly positioned implicitly as a realist or essentialist method that simply retrieves truth and reality, both of which are treated as unproblematically accessible (and are often un[der] theorised). Experience is likewise often assumed to be accessible through TA, and TA is commonly described as particularly compatible with phenomenology (e.g. Guest, MacQueen, and Namey 2012; Joffe 2012) or even as a phenomenological method: "thematic analysis adopts a phenomenological position to systematically identify themes" (Newton-John et al. 2017, 1822).

Before IPA, TA was used as a phenomenological method in psychology (e.g. Dapkus 1985), yet the proclamation that TA and phenomenology are aligned is rarely explained. We speculate that this reflects an understanding of TA as (only) compatible with broadly experiential approaches to qualitative research, and the analysis of 'subjective viewpoints' (Flick 2014, 423) – research underpinned by a reflective view of language and focused on exploring participants' lived experience, sense-making, views, needs, practices and so on, through a broadly 'empathic' lens (Braun and Clarke 2013; Willig 2013). This framing is unnecessarily limited.

In contrast, we position (reflexive) TA as an approach that is flexible enough to be compatible with both experiential and critical qualitative research (see Clarke and Braun 2014b) – no doubt a reflection of our background and training in critical qualitative psychology (see Braun and Clarke 2019a; Jankowski, Braun, and Clarke 2017; Lainson, Braun, and Clarke 2019). Moreover, there is a tradition of 'thematic' discursive methods in psychology such as thematic decomposition (Stenner 1993) and thematic discourse analysis (Singer and Hunter 1999; Taylor and Ussher 2001). And we increasingly see exciting mash-ups of reflexive TA and discursive and narrative approaches, and the development of hybrid approaches like 'thematic narrative analysis', which combines TA to identify themes with narrative analysis to explore the sequential organisation of events in participants' accounts (e.g. Palomäki, Laakasuo, and Salmela 2013). 'Critical thematic analysis' (e.g. Terry and Braun 2011) likewise combines reflexive TA with some features of critical discursive psychology (e.g. Wetherell and Edley 2009).

## Problem Six: Assuming TA is Only Descriptive

Closely related to the previous two Problems is the notion that TA is only a descriptive or data reduction method, in which data patterns are paraphrased or summarised. TA research is assumed to offer a low level of interpretation compared to approaches such as grounded theory or narrative analysis (e.g. Aguinaldo 2012; Vaismoradi, Turunen, and Bondas 2013), and this impoverished conceptualisation of TA is often used to justify combining TA with other approaches (such as grounded theory) that are positioned as offering (a higher level of) interpretation (e.

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

The takeaway... Interpretation is inherent to the (TA) analytic process, and there is nothing in the method of TA that renders it simply summative or descriptive. Interpretative depth lies in the skill of the analyst, not the method. Researchers supervising (postgraduate) student research can usefully emphasise this point to students. (We get many emails from anxious students who have been told that TA is unsuitable for postgraduate and especially doctoral research because it lacks sophistication and is only an atheoretical, [naïve] realist, descriptive method.)

## Problem seven: confusing codes and themes

Reflexive TA makes a distinction between codes and themes, but there is no absolute distinction between codes and themes across TA methods. In many TA approaches, these terms are used interchangeably, or coding is conceptualised as a process of allocating data to predetermined themes. In reflexive TA, a code is conceptualised as an analytic unit or tool, used by researcher to develop (initial) themes. Here, codes can be thought of as entities that capture (at least) one observation, display (usually just) one facet; themes, in contrast, are like multi-faceted crystals – they capture multiple observations or facets (occasionally, rich, complex and multifaceted codes might be 'promoted' to themes [Charmaz 2006], a process called 'subsumption' in IPA [Smith, Flowers, and Larkin 2009]). 

In TA papers where numerous 'themes' are presented, the 'themes' are often one dimensional and meaning-thin; they tend to capture only one (small) observation or facet of meaning (and quite often they are named with just one word). For example, Fornells-Ambrojo et al. (2017), in mixed methods research on service users' experiences of routine outcome monitoring (ROM) in an improving access to psychological therapies for severe mental illness service, reported seven 'overarching'/'superordinate' themes ('superordinate' is associated with IPA [Smith et al. 2009] not TA) and 18 themes. The overarching themes were nested under two headings: 
1. helpful 
2. unhelpful aspects of ROM

From the information presented, the themes appeared to each capture a single semantic observation or insight about users' perceptions (e.g. expressing my feelings, being understood). These are better conceptualised as (reflexive TA) codes. The overarching or superordinate themes were similarly 'thin', and mostly named with one word (e.g. format, distressing, disliked). This also illustrates 'analytic foreclosure' (Connelly and Peltzer 2016) – with further analytic work, underlying patterns of shared meaning could have been identified that drew together several of these 'themes' (codes) into richer, more complex themes that revealed multiple facets of a particular meaning or experience. (As a pre-defined purpose of the analysis was to identify positive and negative aspects of ROM, a codebook or coding reliability approach to TA might have been more in keeping with the purpose of the study, depending on paradigmatic positionings, which in the study leant towards the positivist, as inter-rater reliability was measured.)

The takeaway... Is it a code, or is it a theme? Clarification of what codes and themes represent, and what role they play in analysis, is important. Researchers should consider whether their provisional or candidate themes are one- or multi-dimensional and ensure their conceptual frameworks and reporting of analytic outputs align with the version of TA they are using.

## Problem eight: confusing themes and topics

This is probably one of the most common problems in published TA research, and it hinges on confusion around how themes are conceptualised, as there is no one widely agreed on and adopted conceptualisation of a theme in TA (DeSantis & Ugarriza, 2000). We have subsequently clar

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

## Thematic Analysis Problems and Solutions

clearly conveys that this is a shared meaning with a central organising concept theme – this highlights the importance of naming themes well (Braun and Clarke 2013). Tischner's theme captured the way weight loss was positively framed as a way of improving appearance for women and occupied a mostly unquestioned position as desired and desirable by and for every woman, and something all women would inevitably engage in at some point in their lives.

What is no doubt confusing is that some TA approaches, particularly coding reliability and codebook approaches, treat such topic summaries as themes, when these are quite different from understandings of patterns of thematic meaning. Indeed, if themes are developed prior to any analysis and coding, it is unlikely they can be much more than topic summaries, as it's difficult to conceive of the type of thematic patterning that is the outcome of coding, built from codes, being fully anticipated in advance of any or much analytic work taking place. For themes to be patterns of shared meaning underpinned by a central concept, they must be analytic outputs, not inputs. In addition to the conceptual confusion around 'what is a theme', the use of topics as themes can also be another example of analytic foreclosure (Connelly and Peltzer 2016).

The take away . . . We encourage researchers to reflect on their understanding of themes, to use themes-as-shared-meaning and themes-as-shared-topic knowingly and reflexively, and to clearly justify any use of topic summaries for 'themes' in reflexive TA.

## Problem nine: emerging themes – confusing 'themes-as-pre-existing analysis' with 'themes-as-the-outcome of analysis'

The way some researchers and methodologists write about themes, they appear to conceptualise them as entities that pre-exist analysis, lurking about in the dataset. The researcher's task is to locate and retrieve these themes, for reporting. Such themes are 'diamonds scattered in the sand' (Braun and Clarke 2016, 740), found by the researcher, rather than actively created by them through their interpretative engagement with data. This is effectively 'thematic discovery,' as Guest, Bunce and Johnson (2006: 66) dubbed it. This notion of themes as diamonds in the sand is evident in the phrase 'themes emerged', used by countless authors of TA papers, and evoked by critics of qualitative methods like TA, as the process of theme development (e.g. 'thematic analysis in which themes somehow miraculously emerge from the data'; St. Pierre 2019, 4). We appreciate that the concept of 'emergent themes' is used in approaches such as IPA (and sometimes TA) to reflect the inductive creation of themes, but we are troubled by the implications of the claim 'themes emerged'. The phrasing evokes a process that suggests that themes present from data with little intervention from the researcher other than extraction, once the themes reveal themselves from the (potentially murky) data depths.

We were critical of the language of 'themes emerge' in our 2006 paper: 'An account of themes "emerging" or being "discovered" is a passive account of the process of analysis, and it denies the active role the researcher always plays in identifying patterns/themes, selecting which are of interest, and reporting them to the readers' (p. 80). We quoted Ely et al. 1997, 205–6) who argued that 'if themes "reside" anywhere, they reside in our heads from our thinking about our data and creating links as we understand them.' It seems that our argument was not particularly persuasive, as so many researchers citing our paper and claiming to follow our approach, refer to 'the themes that emerged' from their data (this connects, no doubt, to Problem two). We acknowledge that our (initial) phrasing of the third phase of reflexive TA – 'searching for themes' – has likely contributed to confusion around the conceptualisation of themes

## Evaluating Thematic Analysis Research

Provide a compass and a map to navigate your adventure (Braun, Clarke, and Hayfield 2019b). And we encourage researchers to reflect on whether it is a reflexive, coding reliability or codebook version of TA that is best suited to their philosophical commitments and the analytic purpose of their research.

## Introducing our evaluation tool for reviewers and editors

Researchers who do TA have an important responsibility to do the best quality research they can. But published work also goes through quality assurance processes – peer review, and editorial decision making and guidance – and these steps are also important for ensuring quality. Unfortunately, we know from personal experience they can also be the points at which problems (including some of the 10 discussed above) can either creep in, or even be demanded. Authors can be in a tricky spot navigating the review process. If reviewers or editors suggest or demand something problematic, authors have to:

1. Recognise that it is problematic
2. Find a way to navigate through it

What is the author of a reflexive TA study to do, when faced with a reviewer or editor comment like the one we started this paper with? Should they attempt to 'educate' reviewers and editors about the plurality of TA, the assumptions underpinning reflexive TA? Should they highlight the lack of a single quality standard that cuts across all qualitative analytic approaches? (Levitt et al. 2018)

Yes! We encourage authors to explain and defend their research values, using the information provided in this paper and elsewhere to justify their challenges to requests or requirements from editors and reviewers. We should embed our responses to reviews and editorial feedback in 'best practice' literature.

However, authors can only argue so far... And editors and reviewers hold ultimate responsibility for enacting (or failing to enact) the quality standards debated and developed in the wider research community. There are some basic editorial practices that can facilitate the publication of good quality TA:

- Editors should understand not just their own methodological limits, but their theoretical/conceptual and methodological assumptions and values
- Editors should select at least one reviewer with appropriate methodological expertise to review TA manuscripts (Levitt et al. 2018)
- Editors should ensure the journal's editorial board includes at least one qualitative methodologist with wide-ranging expertise who can help guide appropriate reviewer selection

This latter point is vital if the editor is not a qualitative methodologist. Unless at least one of the 'expert' reviewers chosen by the editor has very wide-ranging and in-depth knowledge of TA, it is easy to see how poor practice is not questioned or challenged, and how the problems we have documented have become so common.

To facilitate better editorial (and reviewer) practice in relation to TA, we have developed a list of evaluation questions for editors and reviewers that lay out some of the key tensions and best practices related to TA (see Table 1).

## Table 1. A tool for evaluating thematic analysis (TA) manuscripts for publication: Twenty questions to guide assessment of TA research quality.

These questions are designed to be used either independently, or alongside our methodological writing on TA, and especially the current paper, if further clarification is needed.

### Adequate choice and explanation of methods and methodology

1. Do the authors explain why they are using TA, even if only briefly?
2. Do the authors clearly specify and justify which type of TA they are using?
3. Is the use and justification of the specific type of TA consistent with the research questions or aims?
4. Is there a good 'fit' between the theoretical and conceptual underpinnings of the research and the specific type of TA (i.e. is there conceptual coherence)?
5. Is there a good 'fit' between the methods of data collection and the specific type of TA?
6. Is the specified type of TA consistently enacted throughout the paper?
7. Is there evidence of problematic assumptions about, and practices around, TA? These

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

These critical questions can offer a quick and easy resolution to at least some of published problems that we see. We encourage TA authors to bring these to editors' attention, for instance, when submitting to a journal.

Finally, we recommend that journal editors provide longer page limits for TA – and other qualitative – papers (Levitt et al. 2018, 2017). Short word counts can significantly constrain how TA research is reported, which can contribute to apparently poorer practice, in all sorts of ways. As Levitt et al. (2018) argued, quality expectations and contextualisation, research reflexivity and illustrating findings with data extracts demand more manuscript pages. As journals are now primarily digital, the scope for expansion is increased. But we would not advocate for a solution where data or methodological commentary are relegated to secondary tables or additional online appendices, because we see these as integral to quality judgements and process (Braun and Clarke 2019b).

## Conclusion

In order to discuss quality in TA, we have delineated ten common problems in published TA research that cites, or claims to follow, our reflexive approach to TA. The first of these – assuming TA is one approach – underlies most of the other problems. And indeed, it is the diversity and plurality of TA – that TA ranges from positivist to critical qualitative paradigms – that presents a key challenge for the qualitative research community in demarcating quality standards for TA research, an issue that has dogged wider qualitative quality discussions. To improve the quality of published TA, we encourage researchers to reflect on the relationship between analytic practices, including quality practices, and the ontological and epistemological foundations of their research, and to use TA knowingly, deliberatively and reflexively. We task reviewers and editors – who are effective arbiters of research quality – with supporting researchers in realising this. To this end, we provided twenty critical questions to consider when reviewing or editing TA manuscripts. But like everything we write about TA, this reflects our current thinking, and things change. So, our most vital piece of advice for anyone using TA, whether reflexive or another approach, is to read the most up-to-date writing and advice from authors, rather than just the 'key reference' for an approach. And finally, we emphasise that TA is not a method for all purposes! Instead of trying to make it fit, when it does not, explore what the many other wonderful qualitative analytic approaches might offer your project instead.
