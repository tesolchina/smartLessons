Since the fourth industrial revolution, intelligent software and applications that attempt to mimic human behavior have become increasingly common. The chatbot is an artificial intelligence-based computer program that simulates human behavior by having a conversation and interacting with users using natural language. The implementation of chatbot technology in the educational context is still in its nascent stage, and further investigation into measuring its effectiveness in supporting learning and teaching processes is required, particularly in the context of higher education. Thus, this study presents the design and implementation of a task-oriented chatbot, that is embedded into the WhatsApp application, called Bashayer. It aims at supporting postgraduate students' motivation and learning strategies in Saudi Arabia.

A quasi-experimental design with a single-subject experimental approach was adopted with a sample of 60 Saudi postgraduate students. The descriptive analysis of the collected data showed promising results of postgraduate students utilized the Bashayer chatbot system. Participants in the experimental group that used Bashayer were more motivated to learn than those in the control group. Participants also practiced more cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies while utilizing the chatbot compared to the control group. The results of this study are encouraging for the development of chatbot systems similar to Bashayer to support postgraduate students' successful learning. These results contribute to bridging the research gap and adding to the literature on chatbots use in postgraduate educational contexts.

## Introduction

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the educational context is increasing. Chatbot technology is an AI application promoted to improve teaching and learning practices (Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola, 2021). Through conversational interactions and simple user interfaces, chatbots encourage users to actively communicate, explore, and build knowledge (Poncette et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2022). Chatbots are defined as conversational tools that provide users instant services and responses (Smutny and Schreiberova, 2020; Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola, 2021). According to Pérez et al., "a chatbot is a tool that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing or other

## Technology-Enhanced Learning Through Chatbots

Chatbots are defined as "a computer program based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which enables it to interact to a certain level of conversation with a human interlocutor through text or voice" (2020, p. 1). Chatbots have been gaining popularity in a variety of industries because of their ability to mimic human conversation, which results in automated services and, consequently, reduced human labor (Ondáš et al., 2019; Alhassan et al., 2022; Kuhail et al., 2022b).

Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot, ELIZA, in 1966. Since then, the ubiquity of chatbots on the internet has grown rapidly (Fryer et al., 2019). The global chatbot industry is predicted to be worth 1.23 billion dollars by 2025 (Kaczorowska-Spychalska, 2019). Chatbots have the potential to support the field of teaching-learning and act as intelligent tools that accommodate students' habits and needs (Tamayo et al., 2020; Troussas et al., 2022). This is particularly true for higher education contexts, where students are autonomous, self-regulated learners.

Chatbots have the potential to transform the educational landscape by engaging learners, customizing learning experiences, assisting instructors, providing deep insight into learner behavior, and creating a more personalized, engaging learning environment for students (Gonda et al., 2018; Cunningham-Nelson et al., 2019; Bezverhny et al., 2020; Villegas-Ch et al., 2020; Kuhail et al., 2022b). These pedagogical agents allow students to obtain individualized and timely feedback through conversations and be guided through virtual environments (Gonda et al., 2018).

Chatbots are becoming increasingly prevalent to promote student learning in e-learning systems (Colace et al., 2018). As support for mobile learning, they are embedded in several e-learning environments, including learning management systems, social network platforms, and digital learning platforms (Wollny et al., 2021; Troussas et al., 2022). Chatbots can instantly provide students with course content, practice questions and answers, assessment criteria, important due dates, academic advising services, directions around campus, and study materials (Mabunda and Ade-Ibijola, 2019; Durall and Kapros, 2020; Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola, 2021). But these intelligent systems do not stop there; they can also improve student participation and reduce teachers' workloads, allowing the latter to devote more time to curriculum development and evaluation (Cunningham-Nelson et al., 2019).

Several studies have been conducted on the application of chatbot technology to the educational context, such as to answer students' queries, help students learn computer programming concepts, provide assessments of students' performance capabilities, and provide administrative services (Clarizia et al., 2018; Sinha et al., 2020). Moreover, with the rising demand for learning, higher education institutions are under a great deal of pressure to accommodate a larger number of enrolments. As the number of students increases, academic support for students significantly decreases. This has been known to lead to ineffective learning and result in higher dropout rates. Although there are several theoretical solutions to this issue, most are impractical to implement due to budgetary and organizational constraints (Hien et al., 2018).

In order to tackle this enormous challenge, tertiary instructors have begun to integrate chatbots into their teaching as pedagogical agents. Chatbots can support individual student learning in large-scale learning environments by assisting the instructor in instantly replying to students' queries, training learners using a variety of learning resources, reintroducing course content and materials,

There has been a paucity of empirical research conducted in Saudi higher education environments. Only two studies, conducted by Alqaidi et al. (2021) and Al-Ghadhban and Al-Twairesh (2020), were found to explore the effects of chatbots in supporting Saudi undergraduate students' learning enquires. However, these studies did not focus on measuring actual learning practices or students' motivational orientations toward chatbots. Therefore, the results of our study will contribute to bridging the research gap in the field of chatbot applications in the Saudi higher education context.

To achieve this goal, the current study aims to integrate the Bashayer chatbot system into a social learning platform via WhatsApp and investigate its effect on the motivation and learning strategies of postgraduate students at King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia. It intends to contribute to the literature on integrating chatbot technologies into education by focusing on two significant factors: learning motivation (task value and self-efficacy for learning and performance) and learning strategies (cognitive and metacognitive self-regulation). These results will contribute to bridging the research gap and adding to the pool of existing literature on chatbot use among postgraduate students. These findings will shed light on the potential of such intelligent tools in increasing learners' motivation and facilitating the practice of learning strategies both cognitively and metacognitively.

### The Chatbot Technology and its Architecture

Chatbots rely on a variety of frameworks that govern their operations. For example, chatbots developed by Microsoft differ from those developed by Facebook (Manaswi, 2018). Although they both have the same purpose of receiving instant messages, they differ in the programming languages used in their development, the type of conversations they provide to the user, and the data models stored in their databases (Hwang and Chang, 2021). Chatbot architecture can be divided into two types. The first is task-oriented chatbots. These are concerned with accomplishing a specific task, and they are prepared in a way that answers the user's inquiries through dialogue. The second is non-task oriented chatbots, which aim to add humor and fun to ordinary conversations without a commercial purpose (Hussain et al., 2019; Vijayakumar et al., 2019).

Hwang and Chang (2021) identified two key components of the chatbots that engage with users using natural language. First, the user message analysis component determines the user's intentions and purpose. Second, the response generation component provides the user with an appropriate response depending on the context and information available to it from the existing dialogue (e.g., user data, geographical area, login times, and clicks to navigate within the chatbot system). In this manner, appropriate responses are presented to the user considering the intent of the conversation and contextual information (Hwang and Chang, 2021). Studies have shown that chatbots have three types of appropriate response generation models: pattern-based, retrieval-based, and generative

## Teaching and Learning with Chatbots

Chatbots can serve multiple roles in teaching-learning modalities (Troussas et al., 2019; Smutny and Schreiberova, 2020). Pedagogically, chatbots can be used as conversers, helplines, and recommendation tools (Lin and Chang, 2020). According to Pérez-Marín (2021), chatbots may engage with students in the role of advisors, tutors, classmates, or gamers. These innovative tools can promote student learning motivation, cognitive skill acquisition, and overall performance (Lin and Mubarok, 2021; Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola, 2021; Pérez-Marín, 2021; Fidan and Gencel, 2022).

Learners can develop their skills by using chatbots to assess their behavior and keep track of their advancement (Colace et al., 2018). Chatbots' consistency, availability, and accessibility as conversational agents facilitate active interactions, which result in engaging experiences for learners (Sriwisathiyakun and Dhamanitayakul, 2022). Such easy and flexible interactions, powered by chatbot technology, enhance autonomous learning, learning engagement, goal orientation, learning strategies, and achievement (Winkler and Söllner, 2018; Durall and Kapros, 2020; Pérez et al., 2020; Smutny and Schreiberova, 2020; Du et al., 2021; Haristiani and Rifai, 2021). In addition, chatbots have the potential to:

- Activate students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills (Goda et al., 2014; Pérez-Marín, 2021; Cabrera et al., 2022)
- Develop learning self-efficacy and self-organization (Durall and Kapros, 2020; Pérez et al., 2020)
- Promote stress management and self-direction (Park et al., 2019)
- Enhance self-regulation in education (Calle et al., 2021; Cabrera et al., 2022)

Chatbot technology has many positive effects and great potential for learning and teaching applications. The chatbot-based environment greatly accentuates how content and materials are presented through the segmentation of learning modules and the organization of learning tasks. Thus, it supports autonomous learning, which is when a learner is able to determine their own learning priorities (Pérez et al., 2020; Haristiani and Rifai, 2021). This allows them to decide what, how, and when to learn, thus supporting the principles of mastery learning (Troussas et al., 2019).

This can be facilitated by offering various activities and enabling students to engage step by step in learning while providing continuous support and feedback, which ultimately allows learners to master the required knowledge and skills. This makes chatbots' learning environments full of educational opportunities characterized by quality and efficiency. Chatbots also promote participatory learning and the exchange of learning materials between individuals regardless of temporal and special boundaries.

In addition, they provide immediate support for learning activities by peers within the same learning environment. This results in the enhancement of the concept of personalized learning by providing learning modules that are compatible with students' cognitive styles (Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola, 2021; Troussas et al., 2022). Furthermore, chatbots support mobile learning and thus benefit from constant availability. They are thus considered to be a practical application of the concept of ubiquitous learning (Heryandi, 2020; Sjöström and Dahlin, 2020).

Chatbot applications are characterized by a familiar user interface that relies on the dialogue style, which is a human characteristic, and easy operating systems that students use in their daily life, such

## Chatbot Systems in Higher Education: Literature Review

Al-Abdullatif et al. found that interactions related to course content between learners and chatbot systems are best suited to graduate-level online courses. Alkhoori et al. (2020) developed the UniBud chatbot, which provided students with voice interaction systems for academic advising. UniBud was found to support a restricted range of academic queries, which permitted academic advisors to answer more involved questions. Kuhail et al. (2022a) developed MyAdvisor, a chatbot for academic advising that used real-world advising scenarios. Students were found to quickly understand it and found it useful. Calle et al. (2021) developed a chatbot-based recommendation system to help students self-manage their learning by delivering suggestions for time, sessions, resources, and activities inside a virtual platform to achieve better outcomes. All four studies dealt with measuring chatbots systems' capabilities in terms of their efficiency in supporting interactions with and academic advising for university students. Given the importance of measuring chatbots' influence on actual learning processes, the current study differs from this literature pool. It empirically measures chatbots' effectiveness in developing motivation levels and supporting cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies.

Another study by Abbasi and Kazi (2014) found that chatbot use had a positive effect on students' memory retention and learning performance. Goda et al. (2014) demonstrated that chatbot use improved students' critical thinking skills and learning engagement in learning the English language. Bailey et al. (2021) created Storybot, a narrative-focused chatbot for language acquisition, and it was found to enhance the students' reading comprehension. They indicated that Storybot was easy to navigate and helped them achieve their learning goals. The current study agrees with this body of research in focusing on the impact of chatbot systems on the learning process, such as achievement and learning engagement. However, it varies from these studies in that it comprehensively measures motivation level through task value and self-efficacy as well as cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies using the conceptual framework by Pintrich (1991). Also, the current study employs a sample of postgraduate students, unlike previous studies that focused only on undergraduate students.

Chatbots are widely utilized in the context of language learning because they provide a free and accessible form of language interaction (Fryer et al., 2019; Haristiani, 2019). Troussas et al. (2017) developed the ALICE chatbot to teach English while providing integrated support to students' learning and assessment. The results indicated that the built-in conversation was beneficial to the mobile learning experience, and the students' feedback was very encouraging. This study is similar to the current research in the possibility of providing students continuous learning support and educational content in a variety of forms. The current study is also characterized by its provision of multiple types of immediate or deferred support and feedback. Haristiani and Rifai (2021) developed Gengobot, a chatbot-based Japanese grammar learning system that was demonstrated to be an engaging, creative, and interactive tool for autonomous learning. Lin and Chang (2020) developed a chatbot to promote the writing skills of post-secondary writers, and they concluded that it has positive effects. They discovered that chatting with chatbots during lessons motivates students to learn, and chatbots make learning easier, more manageable, and more enjoyable. All the aforementioned studies developed chatbot systems and tested their impact on the language learning outcomes of K-12 students. The current study has the advantage of examining chatbot system effectiveness in a different context of language learning with postgraduate students.

Troussas et al. (2020) developed a smart educational application through Facebook called i-LearnC#. It aimed to support student learning by relying on the virtual trainer method to establish a private teaching platform. The application employed the cluster analysis method to recommend optimal groups for student cooperation. The results indicated that the application was educationally beneficial for higher-education students, and it worked to promote effective learning through its role as an adaptive

accordingly. The Bashayer chatbot system was designed and exported on the platform. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the initial design and propose any changes and required amendments. Next, the student sample was divided into two study groups, the control and the experimental, and Bashayer was applied to the experimental group. Finally, the study survey instrument was administered to the two groups, and the necessary statistical measurements were calculated to answer the research questions.

## Setting and sample

The study sample consisted of male and female Saudi postgraduate students enrolled in the Master of Educational Technologies program at the College of Education at King Faisal University. Participants were enrolled in two courses: Reading in Educational Technologies in English Language and Dissertation. A purposeful random sample of 70 male (N = 15) and female (N = 55) students was selected. The participants' ages ranged from 21 to 30 years, and all were enrolled in the first semester of the 2022–2023 academic year. For the purpose of this study, the sample was divided into 10 postgraduate students in the pilot study, 30 postgraduate students in the experimental group (who were taught via online mode using the Bashayer chatbot system), and 30 postgraduate students in the control group (who were taught via traditional face-to-face mode). The participants had to provide informed consent to participate in this study and submit responses to the questionnaires, which ensured their voluntary participation, privacy, and data confidentiality. All their information was used for scientific research purposes only.

## Measurement

To achieve the purpose of this study, the motivated strategies for learning questionnaire (MSLQ) was utilized (Pintrich, 1991). It is a self-reported instrument developed to investigate learning motivation and learning strategies. The survey questionnaire consists of two main scales with a total of 38 items: the motivation scale (14 items) and the learning strategies scale (24 items). The motivation scale includes two subscales: task value (6 items) and self-efficacy for learning and performance (8 items). According to Pintrich (1991), task value refers to the degree that students perceive the course material to be interesting, important, and useful, whereas self-efficacy refers to students' confidence and ability to successfully perform learning tasks.

The learning strategies scale (24 items) includes two subscales: cognitive learning strategies (12 items) and metacognitive self-regulation learning strategies (12 items). Cognitive learning strategies in this context refers to the cognitive processes that students perform when learning. It ranges from simple practices, such as remembering (listing and naming) and understanding (paraphrasing and summarizing), to the practice of organizing (clustering and outlining), to critical thinking (reasoning and problem solving). However, for the purpose of this study, we focus on cognitive learning strategies that include remembering, understanding, and organizing, while the metacognitive self-regulation learning strategies relate to control and self-regulation. These entail students planning, monitoring, and regulating their own learning. Examples include setting goals, tracking cognitive learning, self-testing, and checking and correcting learning as they progress through a task. The participants were asked to respond to the 38-item MSLQ using a 5-point Likert scale. The scale score ranged from 38 (lowest) to 190 (highest).

The MSLQ survey questionnaire has been empirically validated by Pintrich (1991). For this study, the questionnaire was translated into Arabic; therefore, the validity of its content was assessed. This was ascertained by consulting the opinion of three experts who specialized in educational technology and were proficient in English. They examined the translation in terms of meaning accuracy and consistency with the original MLSQ items. The experts deemed the majority of the 38 items to be accurate and advised a few items be rephrased for improved clarity. After following these suggestions, the instrument was finalized.

The statistical reliability of the

## Experimental procedures

In order to assess the design and content validity of the proposed Bashayer chatbot system prior to the experiment, an initial version was presented to three experts who were selected for their extensive experience with information and communication technologies. The purpose of the chatbot, the nature of the courses, and the intended learning outcomes were presented and discussed. The navigation flow map of the Bashayer chatbot system (shown in Figure 2) was also explained to the experts, who then expressed their opinions about the chatbot's appropriateness for the study purpose and target group. They suggested amendments to certain design elements, such as backgrounds, font sizes, and student registration system, which they believed would enhance readability. Furthermore, to support validity, five postgraduate students within the pilot sample were asked to navigate the system to provide suggestions for improvement. The students suggested some modifications to the location of the main menu buttons, and they were adjusted accordingly. After the authors implemented the recommendations, the final version of the Bashayer chatbot was created.

The Bashayer chatbot system was implemented in the study according to Figure 3. The students of the experimental group interacted with the system through WhatsApp using text conversations. The chatbot was produced and hosted using the Freshdesk platform, which enables the free integration of chatbots into social media applications. WhatsApp was chosen due to its immense popularity as a text messaging application; it is even the most popular among university students. After specifying the name of the chatbot, it was linked to the teacher's WhatsApp number and then made available to participants. The teacher began communicating with the students through his own dashboard on the Freshdesk platform. Thus, Bashayer was managed by the teacher using Freshdesk as a host platform. After the students interacted with Bashayer through WhatsApp, their questions and inquiries about the course were directed to Freshdesk, which the system was hosted on. The answers were then searched for in the system database, which was also attached to the platform. Finally, the appropriate responses were directed to the students through Bashayer via WhatsApp.

To initiate the experiment, postgraduate students of the experimental group were introduced to the Bashayer chatbot system and informed about its purpose, its use, and how to communicate with it through WhatsApp. The 11 functions included in the chatbot were explained to the participants:

1. The welcome and electronic registration "hello" function for logging in to Bashayer
2. The "book online" demo class function for electronic course registration
3. The "download curriculum" function for accessing course plans, materials, and lectures
4. The "talk to our education consultant" function for communicating with teachers
5. The "book online review session" function for scheduling electronic review sessions
6. The "course progress summary" function for downloading weekly course materials
7. The "download assignment" function for accessing weekly assignments
8. The "submit assignment" function for uploading completed assignments
9. The "schedule online test" function for selecting exam dates
10. The "download completion certificate" function for accessing course completion certificates
11. The "cancel course subscription" function for canceling course registration within the first 2 weeks

Finally, if any data was entered by the students, and there was no appropriate response registered in the system database for it, the system issued the message, "Sorry, I can't fulfill your request now." The student was then either transferred to the main menu to start again or a ticket was left for the course instructor. The instructors could log in to the Freshdesk platform at their own convenience to respond to the inquiries, as all student data was available on the platform.

## Findings

To measure the homogeneity of the study sample, we calculated the independent samples t-test on both groups' pre-test responses. No statistically significant difference (t = 0.097, p > 0.05) was found between the control group (M = 12.83, SD = 2.704) and experimental group (M = 12.76, SD = 2.608). This confirms the homogeneity of the study sample. Furthermore, in terms of the age variable, the mean and standard deviation of the control group (M = 24.97; SD = 0.49) and the experimental group (M = 24.82; SD = 0.48) indicates that the statistical distribution for the study sample is normal. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test score was 0.20, the Shapiro-Wilk test score was 0.15, and p > 0.05. Therefore, the two groups were homogeneous before the experiment began and follow normal distribution of data.

To carry out the statistical analysis of the current study, data collected from the post-test, which was conducted after the experiment, were tabulated and entered in IBM SPSS v.26 software. The statistical analysis followed two steps. First the descriptive statistics (M, SD, and SE) of the two MSLQ scales (motivation and learning strategies) and their four subscales (task value, self-efficacy for learning and performance, cognitive learning strategies, and metacognitive self-regulated learning strategies) were calculated. Second, the independent samples t-test were performed to measure the statistical differences between the mean scores of the two groups.

## Research Question 1: Chatbot Impact on Learning Motivation

The first research question examined if the use of the Bashayer chatbot system enhances graduate students' learning motivation. Postgraduate students' mean response for task value was 0.7 greater in the experimental group (4.08) than the control group (3.38). Similarly, for self-efficacy for learning and performance, the mean response of the experimental group (3.99) was 0.6 greater than the control group (3.37). For the total MSLQ motivation scale, students from the experimental group (M = 4.03) showed 0.7 greater level of motivation than their peers in the control group (M = 3.34).

The independent samples t-test indicated statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of task value (t = 6.64, p < 0.05) and self-efficacy for learning and performance (t = 4.33, p < 0.05) questions of the MSLQ motivation scale (t = 6.25, p < 0.05), favoring the experimental group. This confirms the positive effect of using the Bashayer chatbot on postgraduate students' learning motivations.

## Research Question 2: Chatbot Impact on Learning Strategies

The second research question examined if the use of the Bashayer chatbot system enhances graduate students' learning strategies. For cognitive learning strategies, the mean response of the experimental group (4.11) was 0.8 greater than the control group (3.33). For metacognitive self-regulation learning strategies, the experimental group's mean response (3.97) was 0.7 greater than the control group (3.25). The total MSLQ learning strategies scale showed the experimental group's mean response (4.04) was 0.8 higher than the control group (3.29).

The independent samples t-test indicated statistically significant differences between groups in cognitive learning strategies (t = 7.18, p < 0.05) and metacognitive self-regulation learning strategies (t = 6.07, p < 0.05) of the MSLQ learning strategies scale (t = 6.89, p < 0.05), favoring the experimental group.

## Discussion

The focus of this study was on understanding the effect of a developed Bashayer chatbot system on learning motivation and learning strategies among postgraduate students in Saudi higher education. The study findings are discussed in the following section, and its several implications are suggested accordingly.

The results of the study indicated that postgraduate students in the experimental group demonstrated higher levels of motivational orientation toward learning when using the Bashayer chatbot system than their peers in the control group. Postgraduate students' motivational orientation was assessed using two elements: task value and self-efficacy for learning and performance. In terms of task value, postgraduate students viewed their learning experience using the Bashayer chatbot system as being more motivating, meaningful, convenient, and beneficial as compared to the traditional learning environment. These results align with previous research studies on chatbot systems' potential to support learning motivation (Nghi et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021; Fidan and Gencel, 2022; Khalil and Rambech, 2022). In terms of self-efficacy for learning and performance, the results indicated that the chatbot enhanced students' confidence and ability to successfully perform and accomplish learning tasks compared to in a conventional learning environment. Similar results have been found in previous studies such as Chen et al. (2020), Pérez et al. (2020), and Chang et al. (2022).

The positive effect of the Bashayer chatbot on postgraduate students' learning motivation may be attributed to its design and embedded features, which create an accessible, flexible, and convenient learning environment (Sjöström and Dahlin, 2020). For example, the chatbot provided a consolidated presentation of relevant content, materials, resources, and assignments for students to view learning procedures, details of all learning tasks, and due dates. It also allowed students to balance between handing over their assignments and devoting themselves to subsequent learning steps and procedures. Instant and continuous feedback via the "inquiry ticket" feature was among those that helped raise students' motivation. The postgraduate students initiated questions that were answered from the lecturer's interface. Responding to students' questions and inquiries greatly helped in guiding them and increasing their involvement in learning activities. Providing feedback and stimulating the interaction cycle that supports social presence are important factors in active engagement with the chatbot learning environment (Lee et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2021; Kohnke, 2022; Mendoza et al., 2022). Moreover, the Bashayer chatbot system provided postgraduate students with a weekly summary of what had been taught over the past week, which the students could review and use to conveniently follow up on learning activities. This helped to bridge students' learning gaps in subjects that had not yet been mastered, thus building confidence in Bashayer's potential to support learning performance. The students were thus motivated by this learning environment that they considered important and of great benefit, which was as advocated by the learning-based chatbot technology of many studies (Pereira et al., 2019; Yueh and Chiang, 2020; Kumar, 2021; Chang et al., 2022; Troussas et al., 2022).

The results of our study indicated that postgraduate students who used the Bashayer chatbot demonstrated a better level of practicing learning strategies than their control group peers. Postgraduate students' learning strategies were evaluated using two elements: cognitive learning strategies and metacognitive self-regulation learning strategies. In terms of the former, the students using the Bashayer chatbot system were able to practice various strategies, even more than those who studied in the traditional environment. This signifies that cognitive learning strategies, such as remembering (listing and naming), understanding (paraphrasing and summarizing), and organizing (clustering and outlining) were enhanced by the learning environment created by the Bashayer chatbot. Despite recent studies (e.g., Deveci Topal et al., 2021; Kumar, 2021) that found no significant influence of chatbot use on K-12 and undergraduate students' cognition and learning achievements, the results

## Implications, limitations and future work

The present study and its findings have yielded several important implications. The results imply that chatbot system designers should focus on providing students with customized, personalized learning environments (Cunningham-Nelson et al., 2019; Bezverhny et al., 2020; Krouska et al., 2020; Yueh and Chiang, 2020). The more meaningful the learning environment is for students, the more motivated to learn, and the more involved in learning activities, they will be (Fryer et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2021). This can be achieved through the inclusion of more intelligent functions that can analyse student-entered data and their interaction styles within the chatbot to better support learning. In addition, the results of this research confirm that when designing a chatbot system, its construction should reflect and be properly aligned with conceptual course maps, learning outcomes, and students' characteristics. Also, it should be designed to provide levels of curiosity, challenge, and mastery. Therefore, chatbots should be designed according to students' cognitive learning styles (Sjöström and Dahlin, 2020). All the learning activities carried out by the students should be targeted to achieve the best outcomes, thus building students' confidence in chatbot-based learning environments.

There are several limitations in the current study:

1. Due to the quasi-experimental nature of this study, the small sample of 60 postgraduate students limits the possibility of generalizing the obtained results to the wider population. Future studies should thus conduct descriptive studies with a larger sample size of the target population.

2. In terms of context, the nature of the courses that the Bashayer chatbot system was implemented in is theoretical. Therefore, the results may vary when the chatbot is applied to courses from other disciplines that are of an applied or practical nature. Accordingly, it is advisable to design and test a chatbot system specifically for such courses and measure its effectiveness on postgraduate students' motivation and learning strategies.

3. The experiment was conducted only over a short duration of one semester. Our courses are taught in a one-semester system and not extended throughout the year. Therefore, we propose conducting future research when the application period is extended across one or two academic years and includes a variety of courses. This should reduce the potential negative impacts of novelty and eliminate potential biases due to a group's exceptionality in one semester.

4. This study relied on a quantitative methodology through the application of the MSLQ scale; therefore, judgments are based on quantitative data only. Qualitative data would have provided a deeper, richer understanding of the phenomenon. This is especially true for the subject of learning strategies and whether students practice them through cognitive or metacognitive self-regulation, as well as regarding chatbots as an artificial intelligence tool that simulates human performance. Therefore, tools such as observation, interviews, and reflective notes would have helped gain a greater understanding of postgraduate students' experiences with the Bashayer chatbot system.

5. There were limitations in terms of the architecture and functionalities of the Bashayer chatbot system. In the current study, the database that fed Bashayer with necessary data was not always enough to answer all students' queries. Therefore, it is recommended that future chatbot system designs be based on more sophisticated algorithms that enable the designer to expand the range of data stored within them and, thus, generate varied responses commensurate with students' questions.

Furthermore, it is suggested that future research should focus on measuring more complex cognitive learning strategies, such as reasoning and problem-solving. The Bashayer chatbot design was limited to the basic cognitive skills of remembering, understanding, and organizing, with control and self-regulation as the metacognitive skills. Additionally, communication between students and their instructors was conducted through traditional means such as email, phone, or texting via WhatsApp. To further enhance the role of the teacher within the chatbot learning environment, future designs can include an avatar for the instructor (in the form of a virtual teacher) that simulates the instructor's personality and provides support and feedback to students. Furthermore, for future designs, the chatbot systems

## AI Chatbot Effects on Student Learning and Motivation

task value and self-efficacy for learning and performance than those in the control group. Likewise, learning strategies were instigated by measuring postgraduate students' perceptions toward two main subscales: cognitive learning strategies (remembering, understanding, organizing, and reasoning) and metacognitive self-regulation learning strategies (control and self-regulation of learning). The results indicated that by using the chatbot system, participants in the experimental group demonstrated more favorable levels of both cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies than their peers in the control group. All results obtained in this study demonstrated the positive influence of the Bashayer chatbot system, an AI-based tool, on enhancing motivation and learning strategies for Saudi postgraduate students. These results are promising in terms of the potential of chatbot adoption to enhance learning motivation and support cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies among postgraduate students. This study offers motivating results that support the development of more chatbot systems that are similar to Bashayer to support successful learning.
