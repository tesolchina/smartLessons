# RAG-Based Citation Insertion Guide

## Ready-to-Use Citation Templates

Based on the analysis of the LitonGoalChatbot papers, here are specific citation additions organized by likely manuscript sections:

### 1. Introduction Section Additions

#### **Current State of Educational Chatbots**
**Suggested Addition**:
"Recent advances in large language model (LLM) technology have enabled more sophisticated educational chatbots capable of automatically monitoring and supporting student self-regulated learning processes (Hew et al., 2024). These systems can provide personalized feedback and guidance at scale, addressing long-standing challenges in online learning environments."

**Citation**: Hew, K. F., Huang, W., Wang, S., Luo, X., & Gonda, D. E. (2024). Towards a large-language-model-based chatbot system to automatically monitor student goal setting and planning in online learning.

#### **Online Learning Challenges**
**Suggested Addition**:
"The shift to online learning, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has highlighted persistent challenges in supporting student self-regulated learning skills (Du et al., 2023). Students often struggle with goal setting and planning in online environments where traditional teacher guidance is limited."

**Citation**: Du, J., Huang, W., & Hew, K. F. (2023). Supporting students goal setting process using chatbot implementation in a fully online course.

### 2. Literature Review Section Enhancements

#### **Comprehensive Review of Chatbot-SRL Research**
**Suggested Addition**:
"A systematic review of educational chatbots supporting self-regulated learning identified 27 relevant studies, revealing that while chatbots have primarily supported resource identification and strategy enactment, limited guidance has been provided for goal setting and planning activities [Systematic Review Citation]. This gap represents a significant opportunity for advancing chatbot-assisted learning support."

**Citation**: Add the systematic review paper from the collection.

#### **Goal Quality Framework**
**Suggested Addition**:
"Research on student goal-setting effectiveness emphasizes the importance of goal specificity across four dimensions: time, action, standard, and content (TASC framework) (McCardle et al., 2017). However, studies consistently show that students rarely include specific information regarding actions, standards, or content in their self-set goals, limiting their effectiveness for learning regulation."

**Citation**: McCardle, L., Webster, E. A., Haffey, A., & Hadwin, A. F. (2017). Examining students' self-set goals for self-regulated learning: Goal properties and patterns.

#### **SMART Framework in Educational Technology**
**Suggested Addition**:
"The SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-related) has been successfully implemented in educational chatbot design to guide students through structured goal-setting processes (Du et al., 2023). Students reported that such structured approaches helped clarify learning goals and raise awareness of goal-setting importance."

### 3. Methodology Section Support

#### **Chatbot Architecture Design**
**Suggested Addition**:
"Our chatbot architecture builds upon recent advances in dual-agent systems, where separate agents handle goal detection and teaching functions (Hew et al., 2024). This approach addresses the inherent memory limitations of LLMs through Memory-Augmented Prompts (MAP) that incorporate past interactions into current context."

#### **Platform Selection Rationale**
**Suggested Addition**:
"We selected [Platform Name] based on successful implementations in educational settings, including Dialogflow-based systems that have demonstrated effectiveness in guiding students through structured goal-setting processes (Du et al., 2023)."

### 4. Results Section Contextualization

#### **Validation Approach**
**Suggested Addition**:
"Our validation approach follows established precedents where AI-generated assessments are compared with human evaluators. Recent studies have achieved substantial to near-perfect agreement between AI and human coding of student goals and plans (Hew et al., 2024), supporting the viability of automated SRL monitoring systems."

#### **Student Perception Patterns**
**Suggested Addition**:
"Student perceptions of chatbot usefulness align with previous findings where participants reported that chatbot interactions helped clarify learning goals and raise awareness of goal-setting processes (Du et al., 2023). Importantly, students who perceived high usefulness showed significantly greater learning achievements."

### 5. Discussion Section Integration

#### **Mixed Effects in Literature**
**Suggested Addition**:
"Our findings contribute to a growing but mixed body of evidence regarding chatbot effectiveness in educational settings. While systematic reviews indicate that most chatbot interventions promote productive SRL processes, some studies report non-significant or mixed effects [Systematic Review Citation], highlighting the importance of careful design and implementation."

#### **Scalability and Implementation**
**Suggested Addition**:
"The scalability advantages demonstrated in our study address a critical challenge identified in previous research, where providing timely, personalized feedback to large numbers of students has been labor-intensive for teachers (Hew et al., 2024). Automated systems offer potential solutions while maintaining feedback quality."
