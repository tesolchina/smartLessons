## RAG-Generated Citation Templates by Manuscript Section

### Introduction Section

**Template 1: Technology Advancement**
```
"Recent advances in large language model technology have enabled sophisticated educational chatbots capable of automatically monitoring and supporting student self-regulated learning processes (Hew et al., 2024). These systems can provide personalized feedback at scale, addressing longstanding challenges in online learning environments where traditional teacher guidance is limited (Du et al., 2023)."
```

**Template 2: Research Gap**
```
"Despite the growing interest in educational chatbots, systematic reviews reveal significant gaps in goal-setting support, with most systems focusing on resource identification and strategy enactment rather than goal formation and planning activities (Wollny et al., 2021). This represents a critical opportunity given that students consistently struggle with goal quality, rarely including specific information about actions, standards, or content in their self-set goals (McCardle et al., 2017)."
```

### Literature Review Section

**Template 3: SRL Theoretical Foundation**
```
"Self-regulated learning research encompasses six major theoretical models, with differential effects across developmental stages and educational levels (Panadero, 2017). The quality of student goals is particularly critical, with effective goals requiring specificity across four dimensions: time, action, standard, and content (TASC framework) (McCardle et al., 2017)."
```

**Template 4: Chatbot Landscape**
```
"A comprehensive analysis of 74 studies on educational chatbots revealed that while these systems primarily serve learning (49%) and assisting (20%) roles, only 15% function in mentoring capacities that could support goal-setting processes (Wollny et al., 2021). This distribution highlights the underexplored potential of chatbots for metacognitive support."
```

### Methodology Section

**Template 5: Design Rationale**
```
"Our chatbot architecture builds upon recent advances in dual-agent systems, where separate agents handle goal detection and teaching functions, addressing inherent memory limitations of large language models through Memory-Augmented Prompts (Hew et al., 2024). Platform selection follows successful implementations using structured frameworks like SMART criteria in conversational interfaces (Du et al., 2023)."
```

**Template 6: Validation Approach**
```
"Validation methodology follows established precedents where AI-generated assessments achieve substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluators in coding student goals and plans (Hew et al., 2024), supporting the viability of automated SRL monitoring systems."
```

### Results Section

**Template 7: Student Perceptions**
```
"Student perception patterns align with previous findings where participants reported that chatbot interactions helped clarify learning goals and raise awareness of goal-setting processes (Du et al., 2023). Consistent with prior research, students who perceived high system usefulness demonstrated significantly greater learning achievements (Hew et al., 2024)."
```

**Template 8: Effectiveness Comparison**
```
"Our results contribute to mounting evidence regarding differential effectiveness of generative AI versus rule-based chatbot systems, with generative approaches showing advantages in personalization and adaptability (Ng et al., 2024; Lai, 2024)."
```

### Discussion Section

**Template 9: Mixed Effects Context**
```
"Our findings contribute to a growing but mixed body of evidence regarding chatbot effectiveness in educational settings. While systematic reviews indicate that most chatbot interventions promote productive SRL processes, some studies report non-significant or mixed effects (Wollny et al., 2021), highlighting the importance of careful design and implementation considerations."
```

**Template 10: Implementation Challenges**
```
"The scalability advantages demonstrated in our study address critical challenges identified in previous research, where providing timely, personalized feedback to large numbers of students has been labor-intensive for teachers (Hew et al., 2024). However, the persistent mismatch between implementation objectives and evaluation approaches (Wollny et al., 2021) suggests the need for more comprehensive assessment frameworks."
