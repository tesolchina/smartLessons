**ENHANCEMENT:** Add specific evidence from TASC framework
**Replace:** "(McCardle et al., 2016)"
**With:** "(McCardle et al., 2017). Specifically, students rarely include specific information regarding actions, standards, or content in their self-set goals, with improvements in goal quality being either inconsistent or non-existent across a semester"

#### **Section 4: Educational Chatbots**
**Current Text:** "Introduce chatbots as SRL scaffolds: compare rule-based and AI-based approaches (Hew et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2024)."

**ENHANCEMENT:** Add systematic review evidence
**Insert After:** "(Ng et al., 2024)"
**Add:** ". A systematic analysis of 74 studies revealed that while educational chatbots primarily serve learning (49%) and assisting (20%) roles, only 15% function in mentoring capacities that could support goal-setting processes (Wollny et al., 2021)"

**New Citation:** Wollny, S., Schneider, J., Di Mitri, D., Weidlich, J., Rittberger, M., & Drachsler, H. (2021). Are we there yet?—A systematic literature review on chatbots in education.

#### **Section 4: LLM Advantages**
**Current Text:** "advantages of large language model (LLM)-powered AI chatbots (Ng et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024)"

**ENHANCEMENT:** Add cutting-edge LLM implementation evidence
**Insert After:** "(Guan et al., 2024)"
**Add:** ". Recent advances include dual-agent chatbot architectures that achieve substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluators in coding student goals and plans, with students showing significantly greater learning achievements when they perceive high system usefulness (Hew et al., 2024)"

**New Citation:** Hew, K. F., Huang, W., Wang, S., Luo, X., & Gonda, D. E. (2024). Towards a large-language-model-based chatbot system to automatically monitor student goal setting and planning in online learning.

### LITERATURE REVIEW SECTION

#### **SRL Models Paragraph**
**Current Text:** "Although scholars have developed different models of self-regulated learning, they generally agree that the self-regulated learning process is cyclical and involves setting learning goals and employing study strategies (Panadero, 2017, Guan et al., 2024)."

**ENHANCEMENT:** Strengthen the Panadero reference
**Replace:** "(Panadero, 2017, Guan et al., 2024)"
**With:** "(Panadero, 2017). This comprehensive review of six major SRL models provides meta-analytic evidence for differential effects across developmental stages, forming an integrative framework for research and student instruction (Guan et al., 2024)"

#### **Goal Setting Challenges**
**Current Text:** "However, the process of establishing effective learning objectives is often neglected by students in their actual learning activities (Hew, et al., 2022)."

**ENHANCEMENT:** Add specific goal quality evidence
**Insert After:** "(Hew, et al., 2022)"
**Add:** ". Research using the TASC framework (Time, Action, Standard, Content) demonstrates that students consistently struggle with goal specificity, with particularly poor performance in articulating specific actions and standards for achievement (McCardle et al., 2017)"

#### **SMART Framework Application**
**Current Text:** "This framework has been used to help undergraduate students to make learning goals (McCardle et al., 2016, Hew et al., 2022)."

**ENHANCEMENT:** Add practical implementation evidence
**Insert After:** "(Hew et al., 2022)"
**Add:** ". Practical implementations in chatbot systems have demonstrated that SMART framework integration can help students clarify learning goals and raise awareness of goal-setting importance, particularly in fully online course contexts (Du et al., 2023)"

**New Citation:** Du, J., Huang, W., & Hew, K. F. (2023). Supporting students goal setting process using chatbot implementation in a fully online course.

### RESEARCH GAPS SECTION

#### **Current Gap Statement**
**Current Text:** "insufficient research on (a) how AI-based chatbots improve the quality of students' self-set goals"

**ENHANCEMENT:** Add systematic evidence of the gap
**Insert Before:** "insufficient research"
**Add:** "Despite growing interest in educational chatbots, systematic reviews reveal significant gaps in goal-setting support, with most systems focusing on resource identification and strategy enactment rather than goal formation (Wollny et al., 2021). This represents"

## METHODOLOGY SECTION ENHANCEMENTS

### **Platform Selection Rationale**
**Where to Add:** In methodology section where you describe your chatbot platform choice

**Addition:** "Platform selection was informed by successful implementations of conversational goal-setting systems, including Dialogflow-based approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in guiding students through structured SMART goal-setting processes (Du et al., 2023), and advanced LLM architectures using Memory-Augmented Prompts to overcome inherent memory limitations (Hew et al., 2024)."

### **Validation Approach**
**Where to Add:** In methodology section describing how you will validate your system

**Addition:** "Our validation methodology follows established precedents where AI-generated assessments of student goals achieve substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluators (Hew et al., 2024), supporting the viability of automated SRL monitoring and feedback systems."

## DISCUSSION SECTION ENHANCEMENTS

### **Mixed Effects Context**
**Where to Add:** When discussing your results in context

**Addition:** "Our findings contribute to a growing but mixed body of evidence regarding chatbot effectiveness in educational settings. While systematic reviews indicate that most chatbot interventions promote productive SRL processes, some studies report non-significant or mixed effects (Wollny et al., 2021), highlighting the importance of careful design and implementation considerations."

### **Implementation Challenges**
**Where to Add:** When discussing practical implications

**Addition:** "The scalability advantages demonstrated in our study address critical challenges identified in previous research, where providing timely, personalized feedback to large numbers of students has been labor-intensive for teachers (Hew et al., 2024). However, the persistent mismatch between implementation objectives and evaluation approaches in chatbot research (Wollny et al., 2021) suggests the need for more comprehensive assessment frameworks."
