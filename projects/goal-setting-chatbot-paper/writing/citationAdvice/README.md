# Citation Enhancement - Streamlined Guide

## üìã **MASTER_Citation_Guide.md** ‚≠ê **USE THIS FILE**

**Your single, focused resource for manuscript enhancement**

‚úÖ **What it contains:**
- 12+ specific citation recommendations with exact manuscript text
- Before/After examples showing exactly what to change
- 3-phase priority system (70 total minutes, or 30 minutes minimum)
- Exact locations in your manuscript with search-friendly text

‚úÖ **How to use it:**
1. Open your Word manuscript + this guide side-by-side
2. Start with Priority 1 (3 critical citations - 30 minutes)
3. Use Ctrl+F to find the exact text mentioned in the guide
4. Copy the "After" examples directly into your manuscript

## üìÅ Archive Folder
All previous analysis files have been moved to `/archive/` to reduce clutter. The Master Guide contains the most actionable recommendations from all previous analyses.

**Total Enhancement Time:** 30-70 minutes depending on completeness level

## üìú Process & Iterations (based on your feedback)

1) Conversion and First RAG Pass
- Converted the original Word document to Markdown (`manuscript_0902.md`) for structured analysis.
- Ran RAG annotators to produce inline suggestions and a summary (`RAG_Annotated_Manuscript.md`, `RAG_Citation_Summary.md`).

2) Manuscript-Specific Guidance
- Created `Manuscript_Specific_Citation_Guide.md` with explicit insertion points tied to your text.
- Added a broader `Final_RAG_Citation_Guide.md` and plan documents for full coverage.

3) Your Feedback: ‚ÄúToo many files; make it concrete to the manuscript.‚Äù
- Action: Archived non-essential files to `/archive/` and kept a single actionable guide.
- Created `MASTER_Citation_Guide.md` with precise Before/After replacements that reference exact manuscript sentences.

4) Your Feedback: ‚ÄúNot enough citations; sections should echo one another.‚Äù
- Action: Added 12+ additional targeted citations across Intro, Literature Review, Methods, Results, and Discussion.
- Added a Section Echo Map (Lit Review ‚Üí Methods ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Discussion ‚Üí Conclusion) with copy‚Äëpaste sentences and anchor citations (e.g., TAM, SRL cycles, proximal goals, AI vs rule‚Äëbased).

5) Final Streamlining
- Kept only: `MASTER_Citation_Guide.md` and this `README.md` in the root.
- Moved all supporting artifacts (scripts, earlier guides, converted manuscript) to `/archive/` for traceability.

## ‚úÖ What changed vs. original draft

- Added foundational SRL anchors (Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 2013; Panadero, 2017; Winne, 2022)
- Strengthened SMART section (Doran, 1981; Bjerke & Renger, 2017; Latham & Locke, 2007)
- Reinforced rule‚Äëbased limitations and AI advantages (Singh, 2019; Hew, 2021/2022/2025; Ng, 2024; Guan, 2024; Lai, 2024)
- Tied Methods timing to proximal‚Äëgoal literature (Schunk, 1990; Bandura & Schunk, 1981; Seijts & Latham, 2001)
- Linked outcomes to SRL and goal‚Äëattainment findings (Kizilcec, 2017; Garavalia & Gredler, 2002)
- Added resource/personalization evidence (Wollny, 2021; Kuhail, 2022; Mohamad, 2021)
- Introduced a Section Echo Map to ensure claims recur coherently across sections

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Next steps (fast path)

1. Open `MASTER_Citation_Guide.md` and apply Priority 1 (‚âà30 minutes)
2. Apply Priority 2 and the Echo Map sentences (‚âà30‚Äì40 minutes)
3. Verify all newly cited works appear in your References list
4. Optional: we can auto‚Äëapply changes to the Markdown manuscript in `archive/` and provide a diff for review

## ü§ñ Generate a v2 guide with Grok 4

You can send the relevant files (current guide + RAG outputs + manuscript + RAG literature) to Grok 4 and receive a refined guide.

What gets sent:
- `MASTER_Citation_Guide.md`
- `archive/RAG_Annotated_Manuscript.md`
- `archive/RAG_Citation_Summary.md`
- `archive/manuscript_0902.md`
 - Selected `.md` sources from `projects/ZoteroPDF/LitonGoalChatbot` (prioritized by filename keywords like goal, SRL, chatbot, SMART, TAM)

Files added for this workflow:
- `grok_client.py` ‚Äî Minimal xAI API client (OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
- `context_builder.py` ‚Äî Collects and trims the above files into a single prompt context.
- `generate_guide_with_grok.py` ‚Äî Calls Grok and writes `MASTER_Citation_Guide_v2.md`.

Setup (macOS zsh ‚Äî OpenRouter recommended):
1) Set your xAI API key and optional overrides:
```
# OpenRouter key (preferred)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="<your_openrouter_key>"
export OPENROUTER_API_BASE="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"  # default
export GROK_MODEL="x-ai/grok-4"                             # default

# or direct xAI (not required if using OpenRouter)
# export XAI_API_KEY="<your_xai_key>"
# export XAI_API_BASE="https://api.x.ai/v1"
```

2) Run the generator from this folder:
```
python3 generate_guide_with_grok.py
```

Result:
- The script writes `MASTER_Citation_Guide_v2.md` with Grok's response and logs usage in `grok_last_call.json`.

Notes:
- The context is trimmed to reasonable character budgets to fit model limits.
- If any of the files are missing, they will simply be skipped.
 - The generator prints verbose logs: provider/base/model, key source, each context file and size, and response usage.

### Include extra RAG sources (optional)

By default, the generator adds up to 12 `.md` literature files from `projects/ZoteroPDF/LitonGoalChatbot` based on filename keywords. Tune with:
```
export RAG_SOURCES_DIR="/absolute/path/to/ZoteroPDF/LitonGoalChatbot"
export RAG_MAX_SOURCES="15"
export RAG_SOURCE_CHAR_LIMIT="10000"
export RAG_FILENAME_KEYWORDS="goal,SRL,chatbot,SMART,TAM,usefulness,ease,proximal,MOOC"
```

### About API key loading

The generator loads the key in this order:
1) `XAI_API_KEY` (environment variable)
2) `XAI_API_KEY_FILE` (path to a file that contains only the key)
3) `.env` files (first match wins):
	- `citationAdvice/.env` (local)
	- `DailyAssistant/tools/.env` and `DailyAssistant/tools/openrouter/.env` (shared), discovered relative to this folder
	- a custom path via `XAI_DOTENV_PATH`

An example is provided in `.env.example` (you can copy to `.env`). If no key is found, the script writes a helpful placeholder and exits gracefully.

### Secrets and git

- `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and `key.txt` in this folder.
- Prefer using `.env` or a key file path via env var; avoid committing secrets.
