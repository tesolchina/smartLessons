However, these rule-based chatbots faced limitations, including restricted response options and a lack of natural conversation flow (Singh et al., 2019; Hew et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2022), which motivated exploration of AI-based alternatives.
```

### 8. Weekly/Proximal Goal Design Justification
**Location:** Methods, sampling/check-in schedule rationale
**Current text:** "The timeframe was selected to provide periodic check-in points ... (Zimmerman, 2008). Moreover, setting short-term goals has been shown ... (Seijts & Latham, 2001)."

**Issue:** Make the logic explicit and anchor to proximal-goal literature earlier in the sentence
**Action:** Insert an explicit proximal-goal bridge sentence

**Insert after the Zimmerman (2008) sentence:**
```
Consistent with proximal-goal research, shorter, frequent targets promote greater use of strategies and persistence than distal goals (Schunk, 1990; Bandura & Schunk, 1981; Seijts & Latham, 2001).
```

```

**After:**
```
Students reported that the chatbot could effectively bridge information gaps by offering access to a wide array of materials, a finding aligned with reviews on educational/service chatbots‚Äô capacity to surface resources and adapt to learner needs (Wollny et al., 2021; Kuhail et al., 2022; Mohamad et al., 2021).
```

```
(Ng et al., 2024; Lai, 2024)
```

## üìç PRIORITY 3: Comprehensive Coverage (Do These Third)

### 6. Chatbot Education Review
**Location:** Literature Review, educational chatbot section
**Current text:** General discussion of chatbots in education

**Issue:** Missing comprehensive review citations
**Action:** Add systematic review references

**Suggested addition after chatbot introduction:**
```
Recent systematic reviews have identified chatbots' growing role in educational contexts, particularly for learning support and student engagement (Wollny et al., 2021; Kuhail et al., 2022).
```

### 7. Proximal vs Distal Goals
**Location:** Literature Review, goal types discussion
**Current text:** "Proximal goals, which are short-term and easier to monitor, provide stronger study motivation than distant goals"

**Issue:** Could strengthen empirical support
**Action:** Add more goal-setting research

**Enhancement:**
```
Proximal goals, which are short-term and easier to monitor, provide stronger study motivation than distant goals (Schunk, 1990), with research consistently showing superior outcomes for proximal goal-setting in educational contexts (Bandura & Schunk, 1981; Seijts & Latham, 2001).
```

### 8. SRL Outcomes and Goal Attainment Links
**Location:** Introduction/Literature Review, when stating that goal setting enhances outcomes
**Current text:** Mentions outcomes broadly

**Issue:** Add empirical links between SRL strategies, behavior, and goal attainment
**Action:** Add Kizilcec et al. (2017) and Garavalia & Gredler (2002)

**Insert immediately after the sentence on outcomes:**
```
This aligns with evidence that SRL strategies predict learner behavior and goal attainment (Kizilcec et al., 2017) and with earlier work connecting academic goals to achievement calibration (Garavalia & Gredler, 2002).
```

### 9. Methods-to-Results Bridge on SMART Coding
**Location:** Results, before reporting SMART distribution improvements
**Current text:** Transition into Table 3

**Issue:** Add one-line bridge that echoes the Methods SMART coding scheme
**Action:** Insert an echo sentence

**Insert before the sentence "Prior to the intervention, only 16.38% ...":**
```
Using the six-tier SMART coding defined in Methods (SMART-0 to SMART-5 based on the five criteria), we observed the following distributional changes:
```

### 10. Discussion Echo to Literature Review on AI vs Rule-Based
**Location:** Discussion, where contributions are summarized
**Current text:** Interprets sustained improvement

**Issue:** Add an explicit echo to earlier AI vs rule-based comparison
**Action:** Insert a bridging clause with citations

**Insert near the start of the paragraph synthesizing contributions:**
```
Consistent with the literature contrasting rule-based with LLM-based chatbots (Hew et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024), our findings indicate that open-ended, adaptive feedback supports deeper goal formulation over time.

## üîÅ Section Echo Map (Make Sections Talk to Each Other)

Use the following one-liners to explicitly connect claims across sections. Insert them verbatim at the suggested spots.

1) Literature Review ‚Üí Methods (Design Rationale)
- **Insert at end of Methods: participants/context paragraph (after ILOs and baseline goals):**
```
As outlined in the Literature Review, SRL unfolds cyclically across forethought, performance, and reflection (Zimmerman, 2013; Panadero, 2017; Winne, 2022); accordingly, our week-by-week schedule operationalizes proximal, monitorable targets (Schunk, 1990; Seijts & Latham, 2001).
```

2) Methods ‚Üí Results (Measurement Echo)
- **Insert before SMART distribution (Table 3) intro:**
```
Following the SMART scheme described in Methods, we report distributional shifts in SMART-0 through SMART-5 across five timepoints.
```

3) Literature Review ‚Üí Discussion (Mechanism Echo)
- **Insert in the first Discussion paragraph:**
```
This pattern aligns with evidence that AI-based chatbots provide adaptive, example-driven scaffolding beyond rule-based systems (Hew et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024), enabling iterative refinement of SMART elements.
```

4) Methods/PU-PEOU ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Discussion (TAM Echo)
- **Insert at the end of the Results paragraph summarizing PU/PEOU means:**
```
These perceptions are consistent with Technology Acceptance Model constructs (Davis, 1989) and help explain sustained engagement.
```
- **Insert in Discussion when interpreting drivers of usefulness:**
```
Grounded in TAM, the high perceived usefulness likely reflects the chatbot‚Äôs timely, personalized guidance, a capability emphasized in recent AI-education studies (Ng et al., 2024; Lai, 2024).
```

5) Introduction Claims ‚Üí Conclusion (Closing Echo)
- **Insert as the first sentence of the Conclusion:**
```
Addressing the gaps identified in the Introduction, our mixed-methods results show immediate and sustained gains in SMART goal quality, with high perceived usefulness and ease of use.
```
