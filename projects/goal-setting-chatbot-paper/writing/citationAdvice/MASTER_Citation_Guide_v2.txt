# Master Citation Enhancement Guide v2
*Focused recommendations with specific manuscript references*

**Version Update (v2 vs v1):** This v2 refines v1 by incorporating RAG-annotated suggestions for 15 targeted insertions, emphasizing high-frequency citations like Doran (1981), Latham & Locke (2007), and Schunk (1990) in under-cited sections (e.g., Results, Discussion). It strengthens cross-section echoes with 2 new map entries for better manuscript cohesion. Priorities are rebalanced for impact, with updated rationale drawing from RAG summary. Total refinements enhance empirical support without exceeding core structure. Timestamp: 2025-09-13 15:27.

Section Echo Map (Make Sections Talk to Each Other)

Use the following one-liners to explicitly connect claims across sections. Insert them verbatim at the suggested spots.

1) Literature Review → Methods (Design Rationale)  
- Insert at end of Methods: participants/context paragraph (after ILOs and baseline goals):  
As outlined in the Literature Review, SRL unfolds cyclically across forethought, performance, and reflection (Zimmerman, 2013; Panadero, 2017; Winne, 2022); accordingly, our week-by-week schedule operationalizes proximal, monitorable targets (Schunk, 1990; Seijts & Latham, 2001; Bandura & Schunk, 1981).

2) Methods → Results (Measurement Echo)  
- Insert before SMART distribution (Table 3) intro:  
Following the SMART scheme described in Methods, we report distributional shifts in SMART-0 through SMART-5 across five timepoints (Doran, 1981; Bjerke & Renger, 2017).

3) Literature Review → Discussion (Mechanism Echo)  
- Insert in the first Discussion paragraph:  
This pattern aligns with evidence that AI-based chatbots provide adaptive, example-driven scaffolding beyond rule-based systems (Hew et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024; Lai, 2024), enabling iterative refinement of SMART elements.

4) Methods/PU-PEOU → Results → Discussion (TAM Echo)  
- Insert at the end of the Results paragraph summarizing PU/PEOU means:  
These perceptions are consistent with Technology Acceptance Model constructs (Davis, 1989; Ng et al., 2024) and help explain sustained engagement.
- Insert in Discussion when interpreting drivers of usefulness:  
Grounded in TAM, the high perceived usefulness likely reflects the chatbot’s timely, personalized guidance, a capability emphasized in recent AI-education studies (Ng et al., 2024; Lai, 2024; Hew et al., 2025).

5) Introduction Claims → Conclusion (Closing Echo)  
- Insert as the first sentence of the Conclusion:  
Addressing the gaps identified in the Introduction, our mixed-methods results show immediate and sustained gains in SMART goal quality, with high perceived usefulness and ease of use (McCardle et al., 2016; Raluy & Mislang, 2022; Brady et al., 2024).

6) New: Results → Discussion (Goal Quality Echo)  
- Insert after quantitative goal improvement in Discussion:  
Echoing the sustained SMART-5 increase from 16.38% to 84.28% in Results (Table 3), this improvement stems from the chatbot's iterative feedback, aligning with proximal goal research (Schunk, 1990; Bandura & Schunk, 1981).

7) New: Discussion → Conclusion (Implications Echo)  
- Insert before practical implications in Conclusion:  
Building on Discussion findings of personalization driving usefulness, this hybrid AI-human model can scale SRL support across disciplines (Ng et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024).
