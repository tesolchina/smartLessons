Issue: Missing foundational citations after the definition
Action: Add core SRL citations immediately after this definition
Before:
Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a dynamic process that enables students to actively plan, manage, and control their learning actions to achieve specific goals.
After:
Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a dynamic process that enables students to actively plan, manage, and control their learning actions to achieve specific goals (Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 2013).

Current text: "students' goals remain vague even after instruction" and similar claims about poor goal quality
Issue: Claims about student goal-setting problems need empirical support
Action: Add research evidence for these claims
Before:
students' goals remain vague even after instruction
After:
students' goals remain vague even after instruction, with research showing that students consistently struggle to create specific, measurable, and time-bound goals (McCardle et al., 2016; Raluy & Mislang, 2022)

3. AI Chatbot Advantage Claims
Location: Literature Review, section comparing AI vs rule-based chatbots
Current text: "AI-based chatbots leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide adaptive, context-sensitive, and personalized interactions"
Issue: Technology claims need recent research support
Action: Add cutting-edge AI chatbot education research
Before:
AI-based chatbots leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide adaptive, context-sensitive, and personalized interactions.
After:
AI-based chatbots leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide adaptive, context-sensitive, and personalized interactions (Ng et al., 2024; Hew et al., 2025), demonstrating superior flexibility compared to rule-based systems (Guan et al., 2024).

4. SRL Cyclical Phases Anchor
Location: Literature Review, SRL model paragraph
Current text: "SRL is characterized by three cyclical phases: forethought, performance, and self-reflection ... (Zimmerman 2002, Zimmerman, 2013, Lee et al., 2025)"
Issue: Strengthen with broader SRL syntheses and recent updates
Action: Add Panadero (2017) and Winne (2022) to broaden and update the model references
Before:
SRL is characterized by three cyclical phases: forethought, performance, and self-reflection ... (Zimmerman 2002, Zimmerman, 2013, Lee et al., 2025).
After:
SRL is characterized by three cyclical phases: forethought, performance, and self-reflection ... (Zimmerman, 2002; Zimmerman, 2013; Panadero, 2017; Winne, 2022; Lee et al., 2025).

PRIORITY 2: Supporting Citations (Do These Second)

4. Technology Acceptance Framework
Location: Methods section, where you discuss perceived usefulness and ease of use
Current text: Discussion of survey measuring "perceived usefulness" and "ease of use"
Issue: Missing reference to Technology Acceptance Model
Action: Add Davis (1989) citation when first mentioning these constructs
Before:
The instrument comprised six items measuring perceived usefulness and four items measuring perceived ease of use.
After:
The instrument comprised six items measuring perceived usefulness and four items measuring perceived ease of use, based on the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989).

5. SMART Framework Enhancement
Location: Literature Review, where SMART goals are discussed
Current text: References to SMART framework with Doran (1981)
Issue: Could strengthen with additional goal-setting research
Action: Add supporting goal-setting literature
Before:
The SMART framework (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-related), introduced by Doran (1981)
After:
The SMART framework (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-related), introduced by Doran (1981) and extensively validated in educational contexts (Bjerke & Renger, 2017; Latham & Locke, 2007)

6. Prior Interventions Synthesis (Web tools and goal management)
Location: Introduction, "Interventions to Support Goal Setting and SRL"
Insert:
Collectively, goal-management tools and web-based portfolio systems have shown promise for scaffolding planning and reflection, though effects on sustained goal quality are mixed (Scholl et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2021).

7. Rule-Based Chatbot Limitations (strengthen evidence)
Location: Literature Review, limitations of rule-based chatbots
Before:
However, these rule-based chatbots faced limitations, including restricted response options, a lack of true intelligent and natural conversation flow ...
After:
However, these rule-based chatbots faced limitations, including restricted response options and a lack of natural conversation flow (Singh et al., 2019; Hew et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2022), which motivated exploration of AI-based alternatives.

8. Weekly/Proximal Goal Design Justification
Location: Methods, sampling/check-in schedule rationale
Insert bridge sentence after Zimmerman (2008):
Consistent with proximal-goal research, shorter, frequent targets promote greater use of strategies and persistence than distal goals (Schunk, 1990; Bandura & Schunk, 1981; Seijts & Latham, 2001).

9. Personalization and Resource Provision by Chatbots
Location: Discussion theme "personalized learning"
Insert:
Students reported that the chatbot could effectively bridge information gaps by offering access to a wide array of materials, a finding aligned with reviews on educational/service chatbots’ capacity to surface resources and adapt to learner needs (Wollny et al., 2021; Kuhail et al., 2022; Mohamad et al., 2021).

10. Connecting AI Personalization to Outcomes
Location: Discussion
Insert at end of personalization sentence: (Ng et al., 2024; Lai, 2024)

PRIORITY 3: Comprehensive Coverage (Do These Third)

6. Chatbot Education Review
Insert:
Recent systematic reviews have identified chatbots' growing role in educational contexts, particularly for learning support and student engagement (Wollny et al., 2021; Kuhail et al., 2022).

7. Proximal vs Distal Goals
Enhancement:
Proximal goals, which are short-term and easier to monitor, provide stronger study motivation than distant goals (Schunk, 1990), with research consistently showing superior outcomes for proximal goal-setting in educational contexts (Bandura & Schunk, 1981; Seijts & Latham, 2001).

8. SRL Outcomes and Goal Attainment Links
Insert:
This aligns with evidence that SRL strategies predict learner behavior and goal attainment (Kizilcec et al., 2017) and with earlier work connecting academic goals to achievement calibration (Garavalia & Gredler, 2002).

9. Methods-to-Results Bridge on SMART Coding
Insert before SMART table intro:
Using the six-tier SMART coding defined in Methods (SMART-0 to SMART-5 based on the five criteria), we observed the following distributional changes:

10. Discussion Echo to Literature Review on AI vs Rule-Based
Insert in Discussion:
Consistent with the literature contrasting rule-based with LLM-based chatbots (Hew et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2024; Guan et al., 2024), our findings indicate that open-ended, adaptive feedback supports deeper goal formulation over time.
