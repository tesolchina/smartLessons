# Goal-Setting Chatbot Paper Project




**Project Created**: September 6, 2025
**Status**: Planning Phase
**Type**: Academic Research Paper

## 📋 Project Overview

### Research Focus

Development and evaluation of an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users in setting, tracking, and achieving personal and professional goals through conversational interfaces.

### Key Research Questions

- How can conversational AI effectively guide users through goal-setting processes?
- What design principles optimize user engagement with goal-setting chatbots?
- How do different conversational strategies impact goal achievement rates?
- What metrics best measure the effectiveness of AI-assisted goal setting?

## 🎯 Project Objectives

   - Personalized goal recommendation algorithms
   - Progress tracking and motivation mechanisms
3. **Empirical Study**: User evaluation research including:

   - Participant recruitment and study design
   - Data collection and analysis protocols
   - Statistical evaluation of effectiveness

### Secondary Goals

- Prototype development for demonstration
