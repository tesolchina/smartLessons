Auto-generated index for project `goal-setting-chatbot-paper` at 2025-09-12T07:04:39Z UTC.
<!-- DAILYASSISTANT_TOOLS_PATH=../tools -->
Regenerate with: `python tools/cli/generate_project_indexes.py --dirs goal-setting-chatbot-paper`

## Tool Access
- Tools directory (relative): `../tools` (packaged import: `import dailyassistant` after editable install)
- Tools directory (absolute at generation time): `/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/tools`
- Root quick start: see `../README.md` and `../QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`
- CLI (if installed): run `da --help` or regenerate indexes with `da index projects` (future)
- Environment variable (optional): `export DAILYASSISTANT_ROOT=`git rev-parse --show-toplevel``

### Install & Use
1. Editable install (recommended while developing):
   ````bash
   pip install -e /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant
   ````
2. Run a tool script directly (without install):
   ````bash
   python /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/tools/cli/generate_tool_indexes.py
   ````
3. Via package module after install:
   ````bash
   python -m dailyassistant.cli.generate_tool_indexes
   ````
4. Via CLI (if entry point installed):
   ````bash
   da tool-index
   ````
5. Ad-hoc PYTHONPATH (no install):
   ````bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant python /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/tools/cli/generate_project_indexes.py --dirs goal-setting-chatbot-paper
   ````

### Programmatic Path Detection
- Programmatic path detection snippet:

```python
from pathlib import Path
PROJECT_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
REPO_ROOT = PROJECT_DIR.parent  # contains 'tools' and 'projects'
TOOLS_DIR = REPO_ROOT / 'tools'
```
