[[AI assisted research writing tool]] 

We have a draft in [Tencent docs ](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DTW5OQmxVU1RpUGVj)   
We also have a Bytewise account 

I'll talk to the AI chatbot and raise some comments 
but the meeting today with [[Rachel Ying DONG]] and [[Joannie WEN]] is to achieve the following goals [[2025-08-21]] 
1. clarify and update the timeline 
2. locate the relevant data or documents for future reference (or discussion) 
3. address any issues or questions 
4. explore how the AI writing assistant can be further enhanced
