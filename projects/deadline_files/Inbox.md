    Comment 1: The original proposal was to developed an AI-powered language course.   While other related efforts can be included in this report, the focus should be the course.  We should also check against the [milestones in the proposal](https://kdocs.cn/l/cpXpfs3JSkpW).  If the milestones are not met or changed, justifications should be provide.

Jul 14, 2025 7:39 AM let me work on the Markdown file first - it is on the other Mac; I should retrieve the file and start editing it and load all the questions from Test 1 to Markdown file

The Markdown file should be saved in the same folder as the folder shared by Rhett  

I should reply to the email and raise questions 

I should also refer to Joanne’s questions raised earlier -maybe all these should be done via the folder 

  

Is there a folder in OneDrive
