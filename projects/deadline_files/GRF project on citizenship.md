[[SCMP letter collection]] 
#deadline #toSchedule 
Ben has got some money 
we need to build a database for the letters 

[Airtable database](https://airtable.com/appmCUZLTsXQW600b/tblzRDx67aD1hCnio/viw3aTK9yoBSnLkhI)  - actually maybe I should update the database a bit 
Let me locate all the more recent letters published 

1. one on Alaska
2. one on toilet  
3. 


## planning and brainstorming 

Here's how you can manage and enhance your letters collection after importing from Airtable:

1. **Adding Tags**
   - You can add tags in the frontmatter (YAML) of each note:
   ```yaml
   ---
   tags:
     - SCMP
     - education
     - climate
     - student-writing
     - published-2023
   ---
   ```
   - Tags can be nested using "/" like: `education/policy`, `education/curriculum`

2. **Organizing and Analysis**
   You can use Dataview queries to:
   - List all letters by specific topics
   - Track publication dates
   - Group student letters by themes
   - Create summary views of your collection

3. **Example Dataview Query**
   ```dataview
   TABLE 
     publication_date as "Date",
     author as "Author",
     topic as "Topic"
   FROM "SCMP Letters"
   SORT publication_date DESC
   ```

4. **Tag Management Strategies**
   - Topic-based tags (e.g., #education, #environment)
   - Time-based tags (#2023, #quarter1)
   - Status tags (#published, #draft)
   - Author type (#student, #teacher)
   - Response type (#response-letter, #original)

5. **Bulk Tag Updates**
   - Use the "Quick Add" plugin to batch add tags
   - Create tag hierarchies for better organization
   - Use the Search and Replace plugin for bulk updates

Would you like me to:
1. Provide more specific Dataview queries for your collection?
2. Suggest a comprehensive tagging system?
3. Show how to create dynamic views of your letters based on specific criteria?
Here's a step-by-step guide to create a two-way workflow between Airtable and Obsidian:

**Import from Airtable to Obsidian:**
1. In Airtable:
   - View your letters table
   - Click 'Download CSV'
   - Make sure you have all necessary columns (title, content, date, author, etc.)

2. Convert CSV to Markdown:
   - You can use tools like Pandas (Python) or a CSV-to-Markdown converter
   - Each row should become a separate Markdown file
   - Ensure frontmatter (YAML) includes all Airtable fields

3. Suggested Frontmatter Structure:
```yaml
---
airtable_id: [preserve original Airtable record ID]
title: 
author:
publication_date:
status:
topic:
tags:
last_modified: 
---
```

**For Future Two-way Sync:**
1. Important fields to maintain:
   - Keep the Airtable record ID in frontmatter
   - Add a `last_modified` field
   - Use consistent field names between Airtable and Obsidian

2. For New Letters in Obsidian:
   - Create a template with all necessary fields
   - Example template:
```yaml
---
airtable_id: "new"
title: 
author:
publication_date: {{date}}
status: draft
topic:
tags:
last_modified: {{date}}
---

[Letter content here]
```

3. Export back to Airtable:
   - Use Dataview to generate a CSV
   - Example query:
```dataview
TABLE
  airtable_id,
  title,
  author,
  publication_date,
  status,
  topic,
  tags
FROM "SCMP Letters"
SORT publication_date DESC
```

Would you like me to:
1. Provide a specific Python script for the conversion?
2. Create a more detailed template?
3. Show how to track new vs. existing letters?

Remember: The key to successful two-way sync is maintaining consistent field names and preserving the Airtable record IDs.
