We need a plan for the migration 
But can we first [[revise the LC front page]]  

Background 
- The ITO expects us to use Adobe AEM to develop a new website 
- we had multiple meetings in the past few months 
- we prepared some new page templates 
- but we could not get all the content ready 
- so there is some delay 
- I am a lecturer and an eLearning coordinator - I’ve been contributing quite a bit but hope the admin team can play a more active role to push this project forward Subject: Update on LC Website Revamp and Request for Admin Support

Dear [[Hermine Chan]],

I hope this email finds you well. I’m writing to provide an update on the progress of the [[LC website revamp]] project and to request additional support from the admin team to help drive this initiative forward. I’ve also cc’d [[Cissy Li]] for her awareness and input.

**Progress Update:**
- We have been working on the new LC website using Adobe AEM as per ITO’s expectations.
- Over the past few months, we’ve held multiple meetings and prepared some new page templates.
- However, we have encountered delays as not all content is ready for migration.
- Initial steps, such as revising the LC front page, are underway, and we are also testing the AEM stage environment (see [[Test the AEM Stage]]).
- [[Regina Tsz Wai Ngai]], our summer intern, has been contributing significantly to this project, but we believe more active involvement from the admin team is essential to accelerate our progress.

**Importance of the Project:**
I want to emphasize the transformative potential of this website revamp for the Language Centre. Beyond a visual and functional upgrade, this project offers a unique opportunity to revolutionize data governance within our center. By structuring and centralizing content effectively on the new platform, we can improve accessibility, streamline updates, and ensure consistency in how information is managed and presented. This could set a new standard for efficiency and transparency in our operations.

**Request for Support:**
To ensure the project stays on track and realizes its full potential, I kindly request the assignment of an admin colleague to follow up and monitor the progress of the website revamp. Their role would be crucial in coordinating content preparation, facilitating communication between teams, and ensuring deadlines are met. If possible, I’d appreciate it if we could discuss potential candidates or next steps for this.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or access to relevant documents, such as the folders in OneDrive and Google Drive, or the spreadsheet shared previously for tracking purposes (link: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1va8eFN4KZCqOb8H5AV0sI0ZrhxipMD8iudcms48k-Q8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1va8eFN4KZCqOb8H5AV0sI0ZrhxipMD8iudcms48k-Q8/edit?usp=sharing)).

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to your guidance on how we can proceed.

Best regards,  
Simon Wang

### Update On New LC Website In The Spreadsheet #email_head 
Dear Simon,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to share the spreadsheet for the new LC website(link:[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1va8eFN4KZCqOb8H5AV0sI0ZrhxipMD8iudcms48k-Q8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1va8eFN4KZCqOb8H5AV0sI0ZrhxipMD8iudcms48k-Q8/edit?usp=sharing "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1va8eFN4KZCqOb8H5AV0sI0ZrhxipMD8iudcms48k-Q8/edit?usp=sharing")) and seek your guidance on some problems. 

  

First, the Staff Corner section. It is blank now. As we discussed before, contents like "research team", "scholarship bulletin", "staff publication", and "seminar" are intended to be placed on this page. I'd like to know if it's acceptable to keep these contents listed here as they are for now.

  

Second, I'm unsure about the categorization of some activities. Activities such as "Language Exchange", "English Drama Club", "Reading Club", "Sponsorship Scheme for Student-led Language Enhancement Activities", and "Intercultural Immersive Exchange Programme 2024-2025" – should they be classified under "competition" or "Career Development"?

  

Third, the entire Staff Development section has no content yet. I've only put together a general structure for it. If there are specific requirements or materials to include here, please let me know.
  

Best regards,

Regina
