## üìÑ Letter 1: "White Elephant" Critique (January 2023)

### **Source:** [SCMP - Is Hong Kong&#39;s emergency alert system a white elephant?](https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3208166/hong-kongs-emergency-alert-system-white-elephant)

### **Authors:** Kam Cheun Wong and Myron Lai, Kowloon Tong

### **Original Letter:**

> In March last year, Hongkongers were informed through a text message on their mobile phones that Queen Elizabeth Hospital had been converted into a designated facility for Covid-19 patients. An insistent buzzing sound alerted mobile phone users to the incoming message, which was sent using the emergency alert system that was launched in November 2020 and cost HK$150 million (US$19.18 million) to develop. The funding was approved by the Legislative Council Finance Committee in February 2020 as part of a HK$30 billion injection into the anti-epidemic fund.
>
> it begins with some background - an event that we all experienced; then there is some digging info 
>
> question How do we get the info about the finance committee - Google specific search: "emergency alert system" site:legco.gov.hk 
>
> In the past, the government received help from local mobile network operators to send emergency text messages to the public pursuant to an agreement reached in 2008.
>
> While the Finance Committee was told that the old system was used 12 times in the 12 months to February 2020, the lawmakers were perhaps not fully informed about the total usage of the system. According to the government's response to our inquiry under the Code on Access to Information, the government used SMS to disseminate messages 13 times from 2019 to 2020 and 12 times from 2009 to 2010. The system was used once in 2021.
>
> We wonder if the Legco Finance Committee would have responded differently if it had been told that the old system was used only 26 times in 14 years, including nine years when it was not used at all.
>
> The main advantage of the new system is that an emergency message could be sent to the public within seconds whereas the old system would require four hours. Considering the ubiquity of instant messaging services and social media that can spread messages instantly, we urge the Legislative Council members to review the necessity of developing such an expensive system and be more vigilant when reviewing similar funding requests in future.

### **Main Argument:**

The new emergency alert system may be unnecessary and wasteful

### **Key Evidence:**

- **Old system:** Used only 26 times in 14 years (9 years unused)
- **New system cost:** HK$150 million vs. previous free SMS system
- **Speed advantage:** Seconds vs. 4 hours (but instant messaging already exists)
- **Usage transparency:** Government didn't fully inform lawmakers about low usage

### **Rhetorical Strategies:**

- ‚úÖ **Data-driven argument** (specific numbers and timeframes)
- ‚úÖ **Cost-benefit analysis** (questioning value proposition)
- ‚úÖ **Procedural critique** (Legislative Council oversight)

## üìÑ Letter 2: "Define When and How" (December 2023)

### **Source:** [SCMP - Hong Kong must define when and how its emergency warning system works](https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3243485/hong-kong-must-define-when-and-how-its-emergency-warning-system-works)

### **Authors:** Joyce Ip, Ying Ying Kwong and Dezer Yuan, Kowloon Tong (Team Research)

### **Original Letter:**

> Since the launch of Hong Kong's emergency alert system three years ago, questions have been raised about its use and effectiveness in crisis management. More specifically, Hongkongers asked why it was not used to warn of extreme weather events like the black rainstorm in early September, yet was used in March 2022 to notify people that Queen Elizabeth Hospital had been re-designated as a Covid-19 facility. Was the former not more of a citywide emergency than the latter? What are the usage protocols of the system?
>
> Three years after its launch, it's time to optimise the system by drawing on international best practices and focusing on promptness, targeted messaging, transparency and public trust.
>
> The United Kingdom's alert system offers a dedicated online platform detailing current and past alerts, as well as system tests. Introducing such a platform for Hong Kong would promote transparency, enabling residents to verify alerts and understand the system's operations.
>
> Regular system tests, like those conducted in the UK, are also crucial for the public to familiarise themselves with the alerts and assess system performance.
>
> Hong Kong should also improve its alert protocols. There are two levels of alert. For the higher-level alert, the current protocol requires approval from both the relevant department and the chief secretary, potentially delaying the dissemination of vital information during crises. Hong Kong should empower relevant departments with the authority to promptly issue alerts without needing additional approval, provided that detailed procedures are established beforehand.
>
> Another area for improvement is the ability to issue targeted messages. The confused public reaction to the alert about Queen Elizabeth Hospital's re-designation in 2022 shows the importance of targeted messaging in avoiding unnecessary citywide disruption when only a specific population segment is involved.
>
> In response to a lawmaker's inquiry, the government says the alert system will be used to send messages to mobile phone users "during unforeseen emergency situations that may cause territory-wide/large-scale outage of critical infrastructure or extensively endanger lives and properties". Yet, nowhere on the system's webpage can we find further information about such emergency situations and how the government plans to respond.
>
> Not only should the government reassess the alert system to ensure it aligns with the severity of emergencies, it must also develop a comprehensive response plan for emergency situations in Hong Kong. This would justify the significant investment in the system.

### **Main Argument:**

The system needs clearer protocols and better implementation

### **Key Evidence:**

- **Inconsistent usage:** Not used for black rainstorm, but used for hospital designation
- **Lack of transparency:** No clear online platform for alerts/tests
- **Approval delays:** Dual approval requirement may slow critical alerts
- **International comparison:** UK system as best practice model

### **Proposed Solutions:**

1. **Dedicated online platform** for transparency
2. **Regular system tests** for public familiarity
3. **Streamlined protocols** (department-level approval)
4. **Targeted messaging** capabilities
5. **Comprehensive response plan** development
