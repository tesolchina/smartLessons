## Questions for Financial Secretary's Office

### Group D: Public Resource Management and Alternative Investments (3 Questions)

**D1. Resource Allocation Justification and Priority Assessment**
How does the government justify significant annual investment in Emergency Alert System infrastructure that sees minimal utilization compared to other public safety and infrastructure needs? What criteria are used to prioritize emergency communication spending relative to other government services?

**D2. Alternative Public Safety Investment Analysis**
What analysis has been conducted comparing the cost-effectiveness of Emergency Alert System investment with alternative public safety communication methods or infrastructure projects? How would equivalent investment in other public safety measures compare in terms of citizen benefit and utilization?

**D3. Performance-Based Budget Allocation and Accountability**
What performance metrics govern continued budget allocation for the Emergency Alert System? How does the government measure success and value delivery for infrastructure with minimal utilization, and what accountability measures ensure efficient use of public resources?

## Questions for Hong Kong Observatory (HKO)

### Group E: Weather Emergency Integration and System Utilization (3 Questions)

**E1. Weather Warning Integration and Alert Coordination**
Why hasn't the Emergency Alert System been integrated with severe weather warnings, particularly during typhoons and extreme weather events that could benefit from mass citizen notification? What coordination exists between HKO and Security Bureau regarding emergency communication for weather-related public safety?

**E2. Emergency Classification and Activation Criteria**
What criteria determine when weather or other natural events warrant Emergency Alert System activation? How does HKO's emergency classification framework align with the alert system's activation thresholds, and what gaps exist in current emergency communication protocols?

**E3. International Weather Emergency Communication Comparison**
How do other countries integrate weather services with emergency alert systems for public safety communication? What international best practices could inform improved utilization of Hong Kong's emergency communication infrastructure for weather-related public safety?

## Strategic Questioning Framework

### Information Gaps These Questions Address:

#### **Cost Transparency and Efficiency Gaps**:
- Detailed infrastructure costs vs. utilization rates and public benefit delivery
- Comparison of emergency alert investment with alternative public safety spending
- Long-term budget planning and resource allocation justification for underutilized infrastructure

#### **Technical Capability and Optimization Gaps**:
- System specifications and potential for enhanced utilization or dual-use applications
- Technology comparison with international systems showing higher utilization
- Integration opportunities with other government services and Smart City initiatives

#### **Utilization Standards and Activation Criteria Gaps**:
- Clear criteria for system activation and emergency classification frameworks
- Coordination between different agencies for comprehensive emergency communication
- International best practices in emergency alert system utilization and effectiveness

### Question Strategy Notes:

**Multi-Agency Coordination**: Questions span multiple departments to reveal coordination challenges and responsibility distribution for emergency communication

**Cost-Benefit Focus**: Emphasis on financial accountability and resource optimization given minimal system utilization

**International Benchmarking**: Multiple questions seek comparison with global best practices in emergency alert system utilization

**Technology Optimization**: Focus on dual-use potential and revenue generation without compromising emergency functionality

**Utilization Enhancement**: Specific attention to expanding appropriate system use for weather, health, and public safety communications

## Follow-Up Research Priorities

Based on government responses to these questions, student teams should prioritize:

1. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**: If government provides cost data, develop comprehensive analysis of spending efficiency vs. alternative public safety investments

2. **International Utilization Comparison**: Research global emergency alert systems with higher usage rates and effectiveness metrics

3. **Revenue Generation Assessment**: Investigate successful dual-use emergency infrastructure models in other jurisdictions

4. **System Optimization Opportunities**: Analyze potential for weather warning integration and expanded public safety communication

5. **Alternative Investment Analysis**: Compare emergency alert spending with other public safety infrastructure options and their utilization rates

---

## Information Request Strategy

### Priority FOI Requests:
1. **Comprehensive cost documentation** including initial investment, annual maintenance, and operational expenses
2. **System usage statistics** and activation decision documentation since implementation
3. **Technical specifications** and infrastructure capability assessments
4. **International comparison studies** and best practice assessments
5. **Budget planning documents** and future investment strategy for emergency communication infrastructure

### Strategic Request Timing:
- **Broad cost and utilization requests** to establish baseline understanding of system efficiency
- **Technical capability requests** to assess optimization and dual-use potential
- **International comparison requests** to benchmark Hong Kong's system against global practices
- **Alternative investment analysis requests** to compare emergency alert spending with other public safety options

### Expected Response Patterns:
- **Security sensitivity**: Some technical specifications may be considered operationally sensitive
- **Cost transparency**: Government may provide general budget information but resist detailed cost breakdowns
- **Utilization justification**: Responses may reveal lack of systematic evaluation or criteria for measuring system success
- **International comparison gaps**: Government may lack comprehensive analysis of alternative approaches or best practices
