# Emergency Alert System Project - Teacher's Notes Summary

## 🚨 Simon's Strategic Insights & Project Framework

### Critical Problem Analysis: The "White Elephant" Emergency Alert System
**Key Facts**: System built 4+ years ago, used only once, potentially millions in maintenance costs annually

### Strategic Arguments to Develop:
1. **Utilization Crisis**: Severe underuse represents massive waste of public resources
2. **Revenue Optimization**: Commercial infrastructure sharing during non-emergency periods
3. **Transparency Deficit**: Hidden maintenance costs and unclear activation criteria
4. **International Best Practices**: Other countries use similar systems far more effectively

### Information Gap Analysis (Simon's Framework):
- **What government won't tell us**: True maintenance costs and infrastructure specifications
- **What we need to expose**: Cost per actual usage vs. international benchmarks
- **Strategic questioning**: Why build expensive infrastructure for once-in-4-years usage?

**Argument**: Multi-million dollar system with once-in-4-years usage represents fundamental resource mismanagement
**Test**: Calculate infrastructure cost per actual emergency vs. alternative notification methods

### Hypothesis 2: Revenue Generation Opportunity  
**Argument**: Commercial infrastructure sharing could offset maintenance costs without compromising emergency capability
**Test**: Research telecommunications infrastructure sharing models and revenue potential with private telecoms

### Hypothesis 3: Activation Criteria Inefficiency
**Argument**: Hong Kong's alert thresholds are inappropriately high compared to international best practices
**Test**: Systematic comparison of activation frequency and criteria across countries with similar systems

### Hypothesis 4: Integration and Optimization Potential
**Argument**: System operates in isolation when it could be integrated with existing emergency services and weather warning systems
**Test**: Analyze coordination possibilities with Observatory, Police, Fire Services, and Hospital Authority
