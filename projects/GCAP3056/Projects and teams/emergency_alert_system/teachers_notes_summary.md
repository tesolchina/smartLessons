# Emergency Alert System Project - Teacher's Notes Summary

the system has been built for 4 years (?) only used once 

we need to request info about maintenance and about its hardware- infrastructure- do a bit research on how the system works 

- request AI to fetch some info about emergency alert system on the topics we covered- please provide URLs and excerpts

let's think a bit about the arguments we can make later 

take a look at /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3056/Projects and teams/anti_scamming_education/teachers_notes_summary.md and learn from its framework 

we are about to meet for week 3 

identify specific tasks that students should work on 

limited progress has been made 

but here are students' notes

How to ensure all people in certain region (like Hong Kong) being able to receive alert?

What are the local mobile network operator provide support to EAS?

What are the constituent facilities for EAS in Hong Kong?

3. How do other countries use the system? How is the system used in other countries?

Suggestion/direction the government can work on:

1. Can it enlarge the range of conditions to send emergency alerts? However, there could be "alert fatigue" from receiving too many non-critical messages (e.g., AMBER Alerts) →need better geo-targeting and message flexibility
2. Conduct regular system tests (like US and UK) →assess system performance & allow the public to familiarise themselves with the alerts
3. Provide more details and guidelines for the alert and possible emergency cases e.g. app or webpage →promote transparency, enabling residents to verify alerts and understand the system’s operations

→ How about stating the criteria for the classification of alert and emergency, clarifying who the adopters are and the costs of the system →currently lack of transparency

4. All the systems are using cell broadcast technology →is it possible to send more accurate targeted messages to prevent overwhelming alerts?
5. Provide suggestions about how EAS can help to prepare for emergency events? Define what kind of emergency. E.g, other supportive systems?

Terrorist attack, Crime Event, Public Order Disturbance,Natural Disasters, Public Health Crises, Traffic / Critical Infrastructure Disruptions, Internet Breakdown, Emerging Risks

* ![unchecked]()Follow-up Q: How to define the term "emergency situations," and what specific examples fall under categories such as extreme weather, serious public safety and health incidents?

**

===============

## Background & Current Status

- **Critical Issue**: System severely underutilized since launch (used only once)
- **Previous Research**: Two letters already published by the class
  1. **First Letter**: Critical analysis of funding issues and lack of transparency to lawmakers https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3208166/hong-kongs-emergency-alert-system-white-elephant 
  2. **Second Letter**: Constructive proposals for when system should be used (including UK case study) https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/3243485/hong-kong-must-define-when-and-how-its-emergency-warning-system-works

## Key Investigation Areas

### 1. Infrastructure & Maintenance Analysis

- **Physical Infrastructure**: Network of towers built for signal transmission （we need more info here）
- **Focus Question**: What is the actual hardware setup and its capabilities? - ask for tendering docs - this could be an important strategy - but may not be available; and the doc can be quite long and technical
- **Financial Analysis**: Investigate recurring maintenance costs (potentially millions annually) - how this maintenance cost relates to the overall budget of OFCA; which team in OFCA is in charge; https://tel.directory.gov.hk/index_OFCA_ENG.html - fetch this 
- **Research Goal**: Understand true operational cost vs. current underutilization 

### 2. Alternative Revenue/Usage Models

- **Sharing Economy Approach**: Rent infrastructure to private companies during non-emergency periods (any precedent? - do more research; how the current telecom companies share the resources and develop their infrastructure; what roles does the OFCA play in managing them )
- **Cost-Sharing Benefits**: Private sector could help offset maintenance costs
- **Revenue Generation**: Potential income from commercial use of infrastructure
- **Feasibility Question**: Is commercial sharing technically and legally possible?

### 3. International Comparative Analysis

- **Research Scope**: How other countries utilize their emergency alert systems
- **Existing Foundation**: Second letter already includes UK case study
- **Expansion Opportunity**: Comprehensive international best practices review
- **Learning Goals**: Identify successful utilization strategies and frequency patterns

### 4. Advanced Emergency Preparedness (Extended Scope)

- **Broader Context**: Emergency alert system as one component of comprehensive disaster preparedness
- **System Integration**: How does it fit with other emergency infrastructure?
- **Hong Kong's Strengths**: Excellent weather warning systems (typhoon, heavy rain signals)
- **Gap Analysis**: What other extreme events need dedicated systems?

may approach Security Bureau; who made the decision to trigger the emergency alert system
