# HKO Chatbot Project - Teacher's Notes Summary

## 🤖 Simon's Strategic Insights & Project Framework

### Critical Problem Analysis: Outdated AI Technology in Government Services
**Key Facts**: HKO chatbot built 3+ years ago using rule-based system (pre-ChatGPT era), limited functionality beyond preset Q&A

### Strategic Arguments to Develop:
1. **Technology Obsolescence**: Rule-based chatbot represents outdated approach when LLM technology offers breakthrough capabilities
2. **Public Service Enhancement**: LLM integration could dramatically improve citizen access to weather information
3. **Cost-Effective Innovation**: External partnerships could provide modern solutions within budget constraints
4. **Data Transparency Opportunity**: Leveraging HKO's extensive open data for enhanced public services

### Information Gap Analysis (Simon's Framework):
- **What government won't tell us**: Current chatbot development costs and upgrade planning
- **What we need to expose**: Comparison between outdated rule-based system vs. modern LLM capabilities
- **Strategic questioning**: Why maintain inferior technology when superior alternatives exist?
