# HKO Chatbot Project - Teacher's Notes Summary

## Background & Context
- HKO chatbot was originally developed 3+ years ago as a **rule-based system** (pre-ChatGPT era)
- Rule-based chatbots use flowcharts and predefined Q&A tables, limiting functionality beyond preset questions
- Large Language Models (LLMs) now offer breakthrough capability for human-like text generation and natural language responses

## Key Questions & Investigation Areas

### Current Technology Status
1. **Has HKO upgraded their chatbot with LLM technology?**
   - If yes: Need to test current capabilities and identify improvement opportunities
   - If no: Explore how they can implement LLM-powered chatbot

2. **Tendering Process Investigation**
   - Check if HKO has conducted new tenders for chatbot upgrades
   - Request tendering documents to understand current technology requirements
   - Analyze technology specifications and vendor capabilities

### Technical Infrastructure Requirements

#### Data & Knowledge Base
- **Critical Need**: Robust database/knowledge base for LLM integration
- Cannot rely solely on ChatGPT's general training data
- Requires **real-time weather and observatory-specific information**
- Need to ensure chatbot access to latest, accurate data

#### Data Availability & Transparency
- **HKO as Data Provider**: Check data.gov.hk (Hong Kong Open Data Portal)
- Investigate what data HKO currently shares publicly
- Identify gaps between public and internal data
- Assess data formats and accessibility for chatbot integration

## Potential Arguments to Develop

### 1. Government Transparency & Data Sharing
- **Argument**: HKO should maximize data transparency to enable better public services
- **Supporting Evidence**: HKO already provides data through open data portal
- **Information Needed**: 
  - Complete inventory of HKO's available datasets
  - Data sharing policies and restrictions
  - Technical specifications of data formats

### 2. Cost-Effective Technology Solutions
- **Argument**: External development partnerships can provide cost-effective chatbot solutions
- **Supporting Evidence**: Government budget constraints, outsourcing precedents
- **Information Needed**:
  - Current chatbot development/maintenance costs
  - Budget allocations for technology upgrades
  - Comparison with external development costs

### 3. Public Service Enhancement
- **Argument**: LLM-powered chatbot would significantly improve public access to weather information
- **Supporting Evidence**: Demonstration of technical feasibility (teacher's typhoon tracking example)
- **Information Needed**:
  - Current chatbot usage statistics and user feedback
  - Service gaps and user pain points
  - Performance metrics and improvement opportunities

### 4. Technical Feasibility & Innovation
- **Argument**: Modern tools make LLM chatbot development accessible and rapid
- **Supporting Evidence**: Teacher's typhoon tracking site built in hours using HKO API
- **Information Needed**:
  - Available APIs and data access methods
  - Technical infrastructure and capabilities
  - Integration possibilities with existing systems

## Information Gathering Strategy

### Primary Research
1. **FOI Requests**: Submit requests for tendering documents and technology specifications
2. **Data Portal Analysis**: Comprehensive review of data.gov.hk HKO datasets
3. **Current Chatbot Testing**: Evaluate existing chatbot capabilities and limitations
4. **API Documentation**: Review available APIs and data access methods

### Secondary Research
1. **Technology Benchmarking**: Compare HKO chatbot with other government/weather service chatbots
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Research chatbot development costs and ROI
3. **User Experience Studies**: Analyze public feedback and usage patterns

## Next Steps & Action Items
1. Access and analyze the original request document mentioned by teacher
2. Investigate current tendering status and technology specifications
3. Map available data sources and accessibility levels
4. Develop technical proposal for LLM integration
5. Prepare evidence-based recommendations for HKO engagement

## Collaboration Opportunities
- **Direct Engagement**: Write letters/proposals to HKO
- **Demonstration Projects**: Build prototype chatbot using available data
- **Partnership Proposals**: Offer external development support given budget constraints
