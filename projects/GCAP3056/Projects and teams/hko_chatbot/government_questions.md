## Strategic Questioning Framework

### Information Gaps These Questions Address:

#### **Technology Assessment Gaps**:
- Current system limitations and performance metrics
- Cost comparison between maintaining obsolete vs. upgrading to modern technology
- Technical capability assessment and modernization planning

#### **Government Coordination Gaps**:
- Cross-department AI implementation strategy and coordination
- Integration between individual department innovations and broader government digital strategy
- Consistent standards for government AI service development

#### **Procurement Transparency Gaps**:
- Tendering processes and vendor selection criteria for AI technology
- Public consultation and transparency requirements for major technology procurements
- Timeline and accountability measures for technology modernization projects

### Question Strategy Notes:

**Multi-Department Approach**: Questions span multiple government offices to reveal coordination challenges and responsibility distribution

**Technical Specificity**: Focus on concrete technology details, costs, and performance metrics rather than general policy statements

**Procurement Transparency**: Emphasis on transparent processes and public accountability for technology investment decisions

**Data Integration Focus**: Specific attention to how government's extensive open data resources can be optimized through AI technology

**International Standards**: Implicit comparison with global best practices in government AI implementation
