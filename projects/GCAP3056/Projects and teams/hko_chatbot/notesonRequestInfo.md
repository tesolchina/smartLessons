**I hope this email finds you well. We are students interested in public service technology from Baptist University. As a regular user of the “Dr. Tin” chatbot service, I appreciate its interactive features in providing meteorological information; However, with rising extreme weather and rapid AI advances, the current system appears outdated. We urge a prompt upgrade to meet public needs for real-time alerts and modern AI capabilities. We are writing to learn more about the chatbot’s development and performance and would appreciate your clarification on the following:

1. What types of data are collected to support the chatbot's functionality (e.g., user queries, meteorological data, linguistic datasets)?

Chat history → data about the chatbot usage

Data from HKO on weather and related issues → data used to support chatbot functions

2. Could you share usage statistics after 2021 for "Dr. Tin," such as the number of monthly dialogues, user engagement metrics, user reviews, or common query patterns?

Ok → to assess the overall user satisfaction

Benchmarking

3. What key performance metrics (e.g., intent recognition accuracy, response time, user satisfaction) and documented benchmarks are used to evaluate "Dr. Tin"

Ask for evaluation report of Dr Tin in the past 3 years

4. Are there plans to upgrade "Dr. Tin" to a Large Language Model (LLM) or hybrid model, and if so, could you share the expected timeline and enhancements for this upgrade?

Ok- in your view in what ways can LLM enable the chatbots to serve the public more effectively?

5. ⁠Were any external tenders issued for the chatbot's development, and if so, could you share details about the tendering process?

rephrase : any plan to upgrade the current technology ? → tendering

6 . Would Dr.Tin chat bot provide some kind of categorization (intents) or descriptive data about inquiries?
