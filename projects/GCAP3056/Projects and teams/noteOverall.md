in week 3 I made some comments on each project and asked AI to do a bit research 

now students need to follow up and locate more info from different sources and update the google docs 

we should start drafting both the letters to the editor and the argumentative research paper 

for letter to the editor let's focus on the key insights and argument first - it should be about 200 words each; teams could try to write two letters taking different perspectives (we need to locate the letters collection from Notion)

For ARP - at this stage we can put some placeholders but the basic structure should be 

Intro - identify the issue after some discussion of background 

method: how we obtain info and data and our approach 

main findings 

arguments 

call for action 

let's create one md for the letter and another md for the ARP based on what we have 

in addition we should have got a list of questions for  the government 

here we should break the questions into groups 

each group would have up to 3 questions 

so we need three mds in each folder
