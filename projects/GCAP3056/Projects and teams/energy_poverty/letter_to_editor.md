## Letter Option A: Policy Inefficiency Focus

**Title**: "Hong Kong's Electricity Subsidy Scheme Wastes Public Money"

Hong Kong's universal electricity subsidy scheme represents a classic case of poor policy targeting. The government currently provides $1,000 annually to every residential electricity account—regardless of income level—while 210,000 households struggle with genuine energy poverty.

This approach creates a circular inefficiency: middle and upper-income families receive subsidies they don't need, only to pay equivalent amounts back through taxes. Meanwhile, energy-poor households spending over 10% of their income on electricity bills receive token assistance that barely impacts their affordability crisis.

The administrative complexity compounds this waste. Managing credits through electricity billing systems involves multiple stakeholders and significant overhead costs. A targeted tax credit system for low-income households would eliminate this bureaucratic maze while concentrating resources where needed most.

International examples demonstrate effective alternatives. The UK's energy poverty framework provides substantial, focused support to vulnerable households rather than spreading limited resources across all consumers.

Hong Kong's energy poverty affects vulnerable populations in subdivided housing who may not even receive subsidy benefits when accounts are registered to landlords. It's time to abandon this scatter-gun approach and implement evidence-based, targeted energy poverty interventions that actually help those in need.

## Letter Option B: Social Justice Focus

**Title**: "Energy Poverty: Hong Kong's Hidden Crisis Demands Action"

Behind Hong Kong's gleaming skyline, 210,000 households face energy poverty—a hidden crisis that government policy systematically ignores. These families must choose between heating, lighting, and other basic necessities, yet receive the same token $1,000 electricity subsidy as wealthy households who barely notice their energy bills.

The current universal subsidy scheme exemplifies policy blindness to inequality. While comfortable families receive subsidies they don't need, energy-poor households in subdivided housing may see no benefit at all, as subsidies registered to landlord accounts rarely reach tenants paying inflated electricity rates.

This isn't just about money—it's about dignity and health. Children studying by inadequate lighting, elderly residents avoiding heating during winter, and families rationing electricity usage represent systematic failures of social protection. Energy poverty creates cascading impacts on education, health, and social mobility that universal token subsidies cannot address.

Other developed economies recognize energy poverty as a distinct policy challenge requiring targeted intervention. Hong Kong's refusal to officially define or address energy poverty perpetuates social injustice while wasting public resources on ineffective universal schemes.

Government must acknowledge this crisis, define energy poverty officially, and implement targeted assistance that prioritizes vulnerable households over administrative convenience and political optics.

## Research Notes for Letter Development:

### Key Statistics to Support Arguments:
- 210,000 households spend >10% income on energy (WGO 2012)
- Universal $1,000 subsidy to ALL residential accounts
- No official government definition of energy poverty
- Subdivision housing: potential landlord benefit capture

### Potential Letter Angles:
1. **Economic Efficiency**: Cost of universal vs. targeted subsidies
2. **Social Justice**: Energy poverty as human dignity issue  
3. **Policy Comparison**: Hong Kong vs. UK energy poverty frameworks
4. **Administrative Reform**: Tax credits vs. billing system complexity
5. **Housing Justice**: Subdivision tenant vulnerability and landlord exploitation

### Strategic Messaging:
- Frame as policy reform opportunity, not just criticism
- Use concrete examples and international comparisons
- Connect to broader Hong Kong inequality discussions
- Emphasize government accountability and transparency
- Focus on actionable, evidence-based solutions
