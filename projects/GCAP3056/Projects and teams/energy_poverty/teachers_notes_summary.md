# Energy Poverty Project - Teacher's Notes Summary

## 🔋 Simon's Strategic Insights & Project Framework


### Critical Problem Analysis: Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme Inefficiency

**Key Facts**: 210,000+ households (1 in 11 families) spend >10% of income on energy bills, yet government's universal electricity subsidy scheme misses energy-poor households while subsidizing taxpaying families

### **NEW RESEARCH FOCUS**: Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme Analysis

**Government Scheme Details** (Source: [Financial Services and Treasury Bureau](https://www.fstb.gov.hk/en/treasury/fin_rel_shc/electricity-charges-subsidy-scheme.htm)):
- **Universal Coverage**: $1,000 annual subsidy to ALL residential electricity accounts
- **Payment Structure**: $80 monthly for 11 months + $120 final month (June 2023-May 2024)
- **No Income Testing**: Both rich and poor households receive identical subsidies
- **Administrative Complexity**: Credits applied to electricity bills, non-transferable, expires Dec 2025

### Strategic Arguments to Develop:

1. **Policy Inefficiency**: Universal electricity subsidies waste public funds by paying subsidies to taxpaying families (money traveling back and forth)
2. **Administrative Cost Burden**: Complex billing credit system creates unnecessary administrative overhead vs. simple tax credits
3. **Targeting Failure**: Energy-poor households need concentrated support, not universal token amounts that don't address affordability crisis
4. **Landlord Capture**: Subdivision tenants may not benefit from subsidies registered to landlord accounts

### Information Gap Analysis (Simon's Framework):

- **What government won't tell us**: True extent of energy poverty beyond WGO's 210,000 household estimate
- **What we need to expose**: Government's lack of official energy poverty definition and intervention policy
- **Strategic questioning**: Why no government response to documented energy poverty affecting 200,000+ households?

## 🔗 Key Resources & Findings

### World Green Organisation (WGO) 2012 Survey Results

**Critical Statistics**:

- **210,000+ households** classified as "energy-poor" (spending >10% income on energy)
- **1 in 11 Hong Kong families** affected by energy poverty
- **85,000 households** earn <HK$2,000/month with electricity costs >10% of income
- **Basic electricity need**: 400 kilowatt/month (≈HK$400) for two-person family

### Real Cases of Energy Poverty:

#### **Case 1: Mr. Lo (Kwun Tong)**

- **Living conditions**: 50 sq ft unit with poor air circulation
- **Survival strategies**: Uses fan instead of air conditioning to save money
- **Impact**: Compromised comfort and health in extreme heat

#### **Case 2: Mr. Yip (Tuen Mun)**

- **Living conditions**: Converted pig farm shanty with teenage daughter
- **Income**: HK$4,420/month Social Security Assistance
- **Energy costs**: HK$90 electricity + HK$400 LPG = >10% of income
- **Survival strategies**: 6 hours daily in parks to avoid electricity use, open doors instead of AC
- **Landlord exploitation**: Charged HK$1.29/unit vs. market rate HK$0.987 (30% markup)

### Academic Research Findings (Hong Kong Baptist University Study):

#### **Multi-Dimensional Energy Poverty Framework**:

1. **Vulnerability Factors**: Income, housing quality, energy efficiency, accessibility
2. **Household Responses**: Under-consumption, behavioral changes, health compromises
3. **Hidden Energy Poverty**: Households don't reach 10% threshold but experience energy deprivation

#### **Key Research Conclusions**:

- **Traditional 10% indicator ineffective**: Many energy-poor households consume less than 10% but suffer deprivation
- **Under-consumption patterns**: Households reduce energy use as survival mechanism
- **Health and dignity impacts**: Energy poverty affects learning environment, family relationships, and well-being

### Government Policy Context:

- **No official energy poverty definition** in Hong Kong government policy
- **Energy policy focus**: Reliability, safety, environmental impact—NOT affordability
- **Electricity subsidies ineffective**: Landlords don't pass subsidies to tenants
- **Average household energy expenditure**: <5% of income (masking vulnerable populations)

---

## 💡 Research Hypotheses (Arguments to Develop)

### Hypothesis 1: Universal Subsidy Inefficiency

**Argument**: The Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme wastes public resources by providing subsidies to taxpaying households who don't need energy assistance
**Test**: Calculate cost of universal subsidies vs. targeted energy poverty interventions; analyze taxpayer subsidy recipients

### Hypothesis 2: Administrative Inefficiency vs. Tax Credits

**Argument**: Complex electricity bill credit system creates unnecessary administrative costs compared to simple tax credit alternatives
**Test**: Compare administrative costs of current subsidy scheme vs. implementing energy poverty tax credits for low-income households

### Hypothesis 3: Targeting Failure for Energy-Poor Households

**Argument**: $1,000 universal subsidy fails to address energy poverty while real energy-poor households need concentrated, sustained support
**Test**: Document that $83/month subsidy doesn't address energy poverty for households spending $500+ monthly on electricity

### Hypothesis 4: Landlord Capture in Subdivided Housing

**Argument**: Current subsidy scheme design allows landlords to capture benefits while energy-poor subdivision tenants remain vulnerable
**Test**: Document how subsidies registered to landlord accounts don't reach subdivision tenants paying inflated electricity rates

## 🏛️ Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme - Detailed Analysis

### Current Scheme Overview (2023-2025)

**Source**: [Financial Services and Treasury Bureau - Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme](https://www.fstb.gov.hk/en/treasury/fin_rel_shc/electricity-charges-subsidy-scheme.htm)

#### Scheme Structure:
- **Total Amount**: $1,000 per residential electricity account (2023-2024 cycle)
- **Distribution**: $80 monthly for 11 months + $120 final month
- **Coverage**: ALL registered residential electricity accounts (universal, no income testing)
- **Validity**: Until December 31, 2025 or account closure
- **Non-transferable**: Cannot convert to cash or transfer between accounts

#### Key Policy Problems:

### 1. **Universal Distribution Inefficiency**
- **Taxpaying households receive subsidies**: Middle and upper-income families get $1,000 they don't need
- **Administrative waste**: Government pays subsidies to families who then pay taxes back to government
- **Opportunity cost**: Universal subsidies prevent targeted assistance to genuinely energy-poor households

### 2. **Subdivision Housing Loopholes**
- **Landlord benefit capture**: Many subdivided units have electricity accounts in landlord names
- **Tenant exclusion**: Energy-poor tenants may not receive subsidy benefits despite paying electricity costs
- **No enforcement**: Government has no mechanism to ensure subsidies reach actual electricity bill payers

### 3. **Administrative Complexity vs. Tax Credit Alternative**
- **Complex billing system**: Credits applied through electricity companies with tracking balances
- **Administrative costs**: Multiple stakeholders (FSTB, CLP, HK Electric) managing subsidy distribution
- **Tax credit efficiency**: Direct tax credits for energy-poor households would eliminate administrative overhead

### Teacher's Strategic Policy Argument:

**"Easier to just provide tax credits"** - targeted energy poverty tax credits would:
- **Eliminate waste**: No subsidies to taxpaying households who don't need energy assistance
- **Reduce admin costs**: Direct tax system administration vs. complex electricity billing integration
- **Improve targeting**: Focus resources on households genuinely experiencing energy poverty
- **Increase impact**: Concentrate $1,000+ subsidies for fewer, needier households instead of token amounts for everyone

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Research Ethics:

- Protect privacy and dignity of energy-poor households when documenting cases
- Ensure advocacy maintains objectivity while highlighting injustices
- Consider potential unintended consequences of policy recommendations on landlord-tenant relationships

### Methodological Rigor:

- Distinguish between documented energy poverty (WGO survey) and potential hidden cases
- Account for regional differences when applying international frameworks
- Triangulate data sources to verify energy poverty scale and impact claims

### Policy Relevance:

- Focus on actionable recommendations within Hong Kong's social welfare and housing policy framework
- Consider implementation feasibility given current government priorities and budget constraints
- Align proposals with broader social justice and poverty alleviation goals while maintaining energy-specific focus
