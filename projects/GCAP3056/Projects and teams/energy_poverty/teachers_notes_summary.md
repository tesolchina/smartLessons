Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme this could be the focus of our research 


### Critical Problem Analysis: Hidden Energy Poverty in Hong Kong

**Key Facts**: 210,000+ households (1 in 11 families) spend >10% of income on energy bills, yet government provides no official definition or targeted intervention

### Strategic Arguments to Develop:

1. **Hidden Crisis Recognition**: Energy poverty affects vulnerable populations invisible to government policy frameworks
2. **Policy Gap Exploitation**: Government emphasizes energy reliability and safety but ignores affordability and accessibility
3. **Systemic Inequality**: Landlord exploitation and infrastructure gaps create energy injustice for low-income tenants
4. **Multi-dimensional Framework Need**: Traditional expenditure-based measurements miss "hidden" energy poverty patterns

### Information Gap Analysis (Simon's Framework):

- **What government won't tell us**: True extent of energy poverty beyond WGO's 210,000 household estimate
- **What we need to expose**: Government's lack of official energy poverty definition and intervention policy
- **Strategic questioning**: Why no government response to documented energy poverty affecting 200,000+ households?

## 🔗 Key Resources & Findings

### World Green Organisation (WGO) 2012 Survey Results

**Critical Statistics**:

- **210,000+ households** classified as "energy-poor" (spending >10% income on energy)
- **1 in 11 Hong Kong families** affected by energy poverty
- **85,000 households** earn <HK$2,000/month with electricity costs >10% of income
- **Basic electricity need**: 400 kilowatt/month (≈HK$400) for two-person family

### Real Cases of Energy Poverty:

#### **Case 1: Mr. Lo (Kwun Tong)**

- **Living conditions**: 50 sq ft unit with poor air circulation
- **Survival strategies**: Uses fan instead of air conditioning to save money
- **Impact**: Compromised comfort and health in extreme heat

#### **Case 2: Mr. Yip (Tuen Mun)**

- **Living conditions**: Converted pig farm shanty with teenage daughter
- **Income**: HK$4,420/month Social Security Assistance
- **Energy costs**: HK$90 electricity + HK$400 LPG = >10% of income
- **Survival strategies**: 6 hours daily in parks to avoid electricity use, open doors instead of AC
- **Landlord exploitation**: Charged HK$1.29/unit vs. market rate HK$0.987 (30% markup)

### Academic Research Findings (Hong Kong Baptist University Study):

#### **Multi-Dimensional Energy Poverty Framework**:

1. **Vulnerability Factors**: Income, housing quality, energy efficiency, accessibility
2. **Household Responses**: Under-consumption, behavioral changes, health compromises
3. **Hidden Energy Poverty**: Households don't reach 10% threshold but experience energy deprivation

#### **Key Research Conclusions**:

- **Traditional 10% indicator ineffective**: Many energy-poor households consume less than 10% but suffer deprivation
- **Under-consumption patterns**: Households reduce energy use as survival mechanism
- **Health and dignity impacts**: Energy poverty affects learning environment, family relationships, and well-being

### Government Policy Context:

- **No official energy poverty definition** in Hong Kong government policy
- **Energy policy focus**: Reliability, safety, environmental impact—NOT affordability
- **Electricity subsidies ineffective**: Landlords don't pass subsidies to tenants
- **Average household energy expenditure**: <5% of income (masking vulnerable populations)

---

## 💡 Research Hypotheses (Arguments to Develop)

### Hypothesis 1: Government Policy Blindness

**Argument**: Government's lack of energy poverty definition enables systematic neglect of vulnerable populations
**Test**: Compare Hong Kong's non-response with UK's comprehensive energy poverty policy framework

### Hypothesis 2: Landlord Exploitation System

**Argument**: Current electricity subsidy schemes fail because landlords capture benefits while tenants pay inflated rates
**Test**: Document landlord electricity rate markups and analyze subsidy scheme design flaws

### Hypothesis 3: Hidden Energy Poverty Scale

**Argument**: 210,000 household estimate understates true scope due to under-consumption survival behaviors
**Test**: Apply multi-dimensional framework to identify additional households practicing energy deprivation

### Hypothesis 4: Health and Social Justice Impact

**Argument**: Energy poverty creates cascading health, education, and dignity impacts requiring government intervention
**Test**: Document social costs of energy poverty vs. intervention costs using international benchmarks

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Research Ethics:

- Protect privacy and dignity of energy-poor households when documenting cases
- Ensure advocacy maintains objectivity while highlighting injustices
- Consider potential unintended consequences of policy recommendations on landlord-tenant relationships

### Methodological Rigor:

- Distinguish between documented energy poverty (WGO survey) and potential hidden cases
- Account for regional differences when applying international frameworks
- Triangulate data sources to verify energy poverty scale and impact claims

### Policy Relevance:

- Focus on actionable recommendations within Hong Kong's social welfare and housing policy framework
- Consider implementation feasibility given current government priorities and budget constraints
- Align proposals with broader social justice and poverty alleviation goals while maintaining energy-specific focus
