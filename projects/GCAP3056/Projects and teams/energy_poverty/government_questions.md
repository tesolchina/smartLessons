# Government Questions - Energy Poverty Project

## Questions for Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB)

### Group A: Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme Administration (3 Questions)

**A1. Administrative Cost Analysis**
What are the total administrative costs associated with implementing the Electricity Charges Subsidy Scheme, including coordination expenses with CLP Power and HK Electric, system development costs, and ongoing management overhead? Please provide a breakdown of costs per subsidy dollar distributed.

**A2. Recipient Demographics and Impact Assessment**
Can the government provide demographic data on electricity subsidy recipients, including income distribution, housing types, and geographic distribution? What assessment has been conducted on the scheme's effectiveness in addressing energy affordability challenges for different income groups?

**A3. Alternative Implementation Models**
Has the government considered alternative delivery mechanisms for electricity assistance, such as tax credits or direct welfare payments? What analysis has been conducted comparing the administrative efficiency and targeting effectiveness of the current billing credit system versus other potential approaches?

## Questions for Social Welfare Department (SWD)

### Group B: Energy Poverty Recognition and Social Protection (3 Questions)

**B1. Energy Poverty Definition and Policy Framework**
Does the Hong Kong government have an official definition of energy poverty, and if not, why has such a definition not been established despite documented research showing 210,000+ households spending over 10% of income on energy? What plans exist to develop comprehensive energy poverty measurement and intervention frameworks?

**B2. Social Security Assistance and Energy Costs**
What provisions exist within the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) scheme to address high energy costs for low-income households? How does the government assess whether current CSSA allowances adequately cover energy needs, particularly for vulnerable populations such as elderly residents and families with children?

**B3. Cross-Department Coordination on Energy Affordability**
What coordination exists between SWD, Housing Authority, and FSTB regarding energy affordability challenges for public housing residents and subdivision housing tenants? How does the government monitor and address cases where energy costs create financial hardship for welfare recipients?

---

## Questions for Housing Authority (HA)

### Group C: Subdivision Housing and Energy Access (3 Questions)

**C1. Electricity Arrangements in Subdivided Housing**
What regulations govern electricity installations and billing arrangements in subdivided housing units? How does the Housing Authority monitor compliance with electrical safety standards and ensure fair electricity pricing for subdivision tenants?

**C2. Subsidy Access for Subdivision Tenants**
Given that many subdivided housing units have electricity accounts registered to landlords, what mechanisms exist to ensure tenants benefit from government electricity subsidies? Has the government assessed how many subdivision tenants actually receive subsidy benefits versus landlord retention?

**C3. Energy Poverty in Public and Private Housing**
What data does the Housing Authority collect on energy costs and affordability challenges among public housing tenants? How do energy poverty rates compare between public housing, private housing, and subdivided housing populations, and what interventions are available for each group?

## Questions for Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB)

### Group D: Energy Policy and Consumer Protection (3 Questions)

**D1. Energy Affordability vs. Environmental Goals**
How does the government balance environmental energy efficiency goals with energy affordability concerns for low-income households? What support exists for energy-poor households to access energy-efficient appliances or housing improvements that could reduce their electricity costs?

**D2. Utility Regulation and Consumer Protection**
What oversight exists regarding electricity pricing and billing practices, particularly for vulnerable consumers? How does the government monitor potential exploitation of energy-poor households through inflated electricity charges or inappropriate billing arrangements?

**D3. Energy Justice and Policy Integration**
Has the government conducted any assessment of energy justice issues in Hong Kong, including equitable access to affordable energy services? How are energy affordability considerations integrated into broader environmental and energy policy development?

## Questions for Legislative Council Research Service

### Group E: Policy Research and International Comparison (3 Questions)

**E1. Energy Poverty Research and Documentation**
What research has the Legislative Council conducted on energy poverty in Hong Kong since the World Green Organisation's 2012 survey? Are there plans to commission updated research on energy poverty scale, characteristics, and impacts?

**E2. International Energy Poverty Policy Review**
Has the Legislative Council examined international approaches to energy poverty intervention, particularly targeted assistance programs in comparable developed economies? What lessons could Hong Kong learn from jurisdictions such as the UK, which have established comprehensive energy poverty frameworks?

**E3. Legislative Framework for Energy Poverty**
What legislative changes would be required to establish comprehensive energy poverty recognition and intervention in Hong Kong? Has consideration been given to amending existing social welfare or housing legislation to address energy affordability explicitly?

## Strategic Questioning Framework

### Information Gaps These Questions Address:

#### **Policy Transparency Gaps**:
- Government's rationale for universal vs. targeted energy assistance
- Administrative cost justification for current subsidy delivery system
- Cross-departmental coordination on energy affordability issues

#### **Data and Evidence Gaps**:
- Demographic analysis of subsidy recipients and energy poverty impacts
- Assessment of subdivision housing energy arrangements and subsidy access
- Monitoring systems for energy affordability and consumer protection

#### **Policy Development Gaps**:
- Energy poverty definition and measurement framework development
- Integration of energy affordability into social welfare and housing policy
- International best practice review and implementation consideration

### Question Strategy Notes:

**Accountability Focus**: Questions designed to reveal government knowledge gaps, policy coordination failures, and lack of evidence-based decision making

**International Comparison**: Multiple questions reference international frameworks to highlight Hong Kong's policy development gaps

**Cross-Department Analysis**: Questions span multiple government departments to reveal coordination challenges and responsibility gaps

**Data Transparency**: Emphasis on quantitative data requests to establish baseline information for policy advocacy

**Implementation Focus**: Questions probe practical implementation challenges and alternative policy mechanisms

## Follow-Up Research Priorities

Based on government responses to these questions, student teams should prioritize:

1. **Administrative Cost Analysis**: If government provides cost data, conduct efficiency comparison with international targeted programs
2. **Policy Gap Documentation**: Use government non-responses to highlight policy development failures
3. **International Benchmarking**: Develop detailed comparison with jurisdictions that provide comprehensive responses to similar energy poverty challenges
4. **Advocacy Strategy Development**: Use government responses to refine policy recommendations and advocacy arguments
