# Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme - Project Summary

## üéØ Project Objective (Simon's Strategic Framework)

> **Key Research Question**: How can we assess the true cost-effectiveness and optimal implementation of the chronic disease co-care pilot scheme?

### Key Research Focus Areas (Simon's Insights):
1. **Participation Rate Analysis**: If participation is low, how can we promote uptake? Challenge: calculating eligible population size when exclusion criteria are unclear
2. **Quantifying Benefits**: Number of cases discovered thanks to the scheme - how do we measure actual health benefits?
3. **Cost-Effectiveness Assessment**: Compare benefits with costs to evaluate program efficiency
4. **Alternative Data Sources**: Explore eHealth systems and private healthcare data sharing for comprehensive analysis

## üìã Student Action Plan

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks (Week 1-2):
1. **üîç Background Research** (Completed)
   - Review program launch details and basic structure
   - Understand target demographics and eligibility criteria
   - Map basic workflow and government subsidy structure

2. **üìä Healthcare Context Analysis** (Completed)
   - Analyze Hong Kong's dual-track healthcare system
   - Compare with existing screening programs (colorectal cancer, cervical screening)
   - Research VHIS framework and public-private partnerships

### üîÑ Current Week (Week 3):
3. **üéØ Information Gap Analysis** (ONGOING - Phase 1 Completion)
   - **Primary Goal**: Identify what participation and effectiveness data is NOT publicly available
   - Review all gathered public data to pinpoint specific gaps in cost-benefit analysis
   - Formulate targeted questions for government information requests
   - **Key Focus**: What data would reveal true program efficiency and alternative implementation models?
   - **Complete Phase 1**: Finalize public data collection and analysis

### üìù Next Week (Week 4) - Government Information Requests:
4. **üìä Strategic Data Requests**
   - Submit Freedom of Information requests to Hospital Authority and Health Bureau
   - Request specific non-public data on participation rates and diagnostic outcomes
   - Target information that will reveal gaps between program costs and measurable health benefits
   - **Motivation**: Expose information asymmetries about program effectiveness

### üéØ Critical Information Gaps to Target (Week 4 Requests):

#### **High-Priority Non-Public Data:**
1. **Detailed Participation Statistics**
   - Actual enrollment numbers vs. eligible population estimates
   - **Gap**: Public reports show program exists but not detailed uptake analysis

2. **Diagnostic Outcome Data**
   - Number of diabetes/hypertension cases identified through the scheme
   - Follow-up treatment compliance and health outcomes
   - **Gap**: No public data on whether early detection translates to better health outcomes

3. **Cost Structure Breakdown**
   - Per-participant government expenditure beyond doctor subsidies
   - Administrative costs and program management expenses
   - **Gap**: True program cost may be much higher than reported doctor fees

4. **Comparative Effectiveness Analysis**
   - How this scheme compares to other chronic disease prevention methods
   - Cost per case detected vs. other screening approaches
   - **Gap**: No public benchmarking against alternative models

#### **Strategic Questions for Government Requests:**
- "What is the actual participation rate and how is eligible population calculated?"
- "How many diabetes and hypertension cases have been detected and what are the follow-up outcomes?"
- "What is the total cost per case detected including all administrative expenses?"
- "How does this scheme's cost-effectiveness compare to alternative screening methods?"

### üîç Follow-up Research (Week 5-6):
5. **üìã Response Analysis & Gap Documentation**
   - Analyze government responses and identify information still withheld
   - Document systematic gaps between program claims and measurable evidence
   - Prepare evidence for policy recommendations

## üîó Key Resources & Findings

### Hong Kong Healthcare Context
- **Dual-Track System**: 43 public hospitals (88% of in-patient services) vs 12 private hospitals
- **Doctor Distribution**: 60% private practice, 40% public service (14,600+ total doctors)
- **TCM Capacity**: 7,400+ registered Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners
- **Healthcare Spending**: 17% of government expenditure, increased 30% (2007-2011)
- **Source**: [Healthcare in Hong Kong - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Hong_Kong)

### Existing Screening Programs for Comparison
1. **Colorectal Cancer Screening**: ~12% participation rate despite government subsidies
   - **Website**: [Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme](https://www.colonscreen.gov.hk/en/)
   - **Key Issue**: Low uptake in doctor-based screening model

2. **Vaccination Programmes**: Successfully implemented with detailed tracking
   - **Source**: [Centre for Health Protection Statistics](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102226.html)
   - **Note**: Demonstrates government capacity for systematic health interventions

3. **VHIS (Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme)**: Public-private partnership framework
   - **Relevance**: Chronic disease co-care fits within broader healthcare reform strategy

### Current Program Structure
- **Launch**: 2023 (approximately 2 years of operation)
- **Target**: Adults 45+ without prior hypertension/diabetes diagnosis
- **Method**: Subsidized private doctor visits (~HK$200+ per consultation)
- **Scope**: Currently limited to diabetes and hypertension screening only

## üéì Teacher's Original Insights

### Program Implementation Concerns
- **Resource Efficiency**: Doctor involvement may be unnecessary for basic screening procedures
- **Cost Structure**: Government paying private doctors for tests that could be automated
- **Participation Challenges**: Complex eligibility criteria may limit uptake
- **Scope Limitations**: Only covers two chronic diseases when broader screening possible

### International Comparison Context
- **Alternative Models**: Canada and Netherlands use mail-in samples for cancer screening
- **Cost Reduction**: Simplified screening eliminates doctor consultation requirements
- **Teacher's Insight**: Private doctor involvement adds cost without necessarily improving outcomes

### Chinese Medicine Integration Opportunity
- **Background**: Student team member has Chinese medicine expertise
- **Context**: Hong Kong planning Chinese medicine hospital
- **Potential**: 7,400+ registered TCM practitioners represent underutilized healthcare capacity
- **Question**: Could TCM practitioners participate in chronic disease screening and management?

---

## üí° Research Hypotheses (Arguments to Develop)

### Hypothesis 1: Participation Rate Inefficiency
**Argument**: Low participation rates indicate program design barriers that waste public resources
**Test**: Compare participation rates with simpler screening models and identify uptake barriers

### Hypothesis 2: Cost-Effectiveness Gap
**Argument**: Government subsidies to private doctors may not represent optimal value for money
**Test**: Calculate cost per case detected vs. alternative screening approaches (technology-based, TCM integration)

### Hypothesis 3: Scope Optimization Potential
**Argument**: Program could achieve better health outcomes by expanding disease coverage or simplifying procedures
**Test**: International benchmarking of comprehensive chronic disease screening programs

### Hypothesis 4: Healthcare System Integration Opportunity
**Argument**: Program operates in isolation when it could leverage existing healthcare infrastructure more effectively
**Test**: Analyze integration potential with Hospital Authority systems, eHealth records, and TCM practitioners
