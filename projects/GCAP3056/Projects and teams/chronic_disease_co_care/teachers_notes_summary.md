# Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme - Teacher's Notes Summary


key insights for the project

- participation rate --> if not high enough, how to promote further; it might be tricky to calculate because we don't know the size of population not eligible
- number of cases discovered thanks to the scheme-- how to quantify the benefits
- compare the benefits with the cost to assess cost- effectiveness (then how do we assess the costs)
- alternative ways to gather info- how about eHealth; ask private docs and hospitals to share data

## ðŸ”— Hong Kong Healthcare Context & Related Programs

### Healthcare System Structure

Hong Kong operates a **dual-track healthcare system** with both public and private sectors:

- **Public Healthcare**: 43 public hospitals managed by Hospital Authority, serving 88% of in-patient services
- **Private Healthcare**: 12 private hospitals and numerous private clinics
- **Doctor Distribution**: ~60% work in private practice, 40% in public service
- **Source**: [Healthcare in Hong Kong - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Hong_Kong)

### Existing Screening Programs for Comparison

1. **Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme**: Government-subsidized screening with participation rate challenges (~12% uptake)

   - **Website**: [Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme](https://www.colonscreen.gov.hk/en/)
   - **Key Issue**: Low participation despite government funding
2. **Cervical Screening Programme**: Population-based screening initiative

   - **Website**: [Cervical Screening Programme](https://www.cervicalscreening.gov.hk/)
3. **Vaccination Programmes**: Successfully implemented with detailed tracking

   - **Source**: [Centre for Health Protection - Vaccination Statistics](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/102226.html)
   - **Note**: These programs show government capacity for systematic health interventions

### Healthcare Reform Background

- **Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS)**: Major healthcare reform initiative launched to reduce public sector burden
- **Objective**: Encourage middle-class use of private healthcare services
- **Timeline**: Multiple consultations since 2008, implemented in phases
- **Relevance**: Chronic disease co-care scheme fits within broader public-private partnership strategy

## Current Process & Concerns

### Existing Workflow

1. **Eligibility**: Adults 45+ with no prior hypertension/diabetes history
2. **Screening**: Private family doctor performs assessment and blood tests
3. **Diagnosis**: Based on test results rather than clinical judgment
4. **Payment**: Government subsidizes doctor visits (~$200+ per consultation)

### Key Issues Identified

- **Potential Overuse of Resources**: Doctor involvement may be unnecessary for basic screening
- **Cost Inefficiency**: Paying private doctors for procedures that could be streamlined
- **Limited Scope**: Currently only covers diabetes and hypertension

## Potential Arguments to Develop

### 1. Resource Optimization & Cost Efficiency

- **Argument**: Current system overspends on unnecessary medical professional involvement
- **Supporting Evidence**: Colon cancer screening comparison (other countries use mail-in samples)
- **Key Question**: Do we need private doctors for basic screening that could be automated/simplified?
- **International Context**: Canada and Netherlands use mail-in stool samples for colorectal cancer screening, eliminating doctor consultation requirement
- **Sources**: Teacher's reference to international screening models; [Healthcare reform discussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Hong_Kong#Voluntary_Health_Insurance_Scheme_(VHIS))

### 2. Alternative Screening Models

- **Argument**: Simplified screening processes could maintain quality while reducing costs
- **Supporting Evidence**: International examples (Canada, Netherlands use mail-in stool samples for cancer screening)
- **Information Needed**:
  - Cost comparison between current model and alternative screening methods
  - International best practices for chronic disease screening
  - Technology solutions for remote/automated screening
- **Hong Kong Context**: Low participation rate (12%) in colorectal cancer screening suggests current doctor-based model may deter participation
- **Reference**: [Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme](https://www.colonscreen.gov.hk/en/)

### 3. Integration of Chinese Medicine

- **Argument**: Include Chinese medicine practitioners in screening and treatment protocols
- **Supporting Evidence**: Upcoming Chinese medicine hospital, traditional approaches to diabetes/hypertension
- **Information Needed**:
  - Chinese medicine diagnostic capabilities for targeted conditions
  - Regulatory framework for integrating TCM in government health schemes
  - Cost comparison between Western and Chinese medicine approaches
- **Healthcare Context**: Hong Kong has **over 7,400 registered TCM practitioners**, representing significant underutilized healthcare capacity
- **Source**: [Hong Kong Healthcare Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Hong_Kong#Staffing)

### 4. Program Expansion & Scope

- **Argument**: Extend scheme to cover additional chronic diseases (hepatitis B, etc.)
- **Supporting Evidence**: Prevention is more cost-effective than treatment
- **Information Needed**:
  - Cost-benefit analysis of expanding disease coverage
  - Public health priorities and disease burden data
  - Infrastructure requirements for broader screening
