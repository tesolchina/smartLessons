# Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme - Teacher's Notes Summary

## Program Overview
- **Launch**: Started in 2023 (approximately 2 years old)
- **Target**: Adults 45+ years without medical history of hypertension or diabetes
- **Purpose**: Prevention and early screening for chronic diseases
- **Method**: Subsidized visits to private family doctors for screening

## Current Process & Concerns

### Existing Workflow
1. **Eligibility**: Adults 45+ with no prior hypertension/diabetes history
2. **Screening**: Private family doctor performs assessment and blood tests
3. **Diagnosis**: Based on test results rather than clinical judgment
4. **Payment**: Government subsidizes doctor visits (~$200+ per consultation)

### Key Issues Identified
- **Potential Overuse of Resources**: Doctor involvement may be unnecessary for basic screening
- **Cost Inefficiency**: Paying private doctors for procedures that could be streamlined
- **Limited Scope**: Currently only covers diabetes and hypertension

## Potential Arguments to Develop

### 1. Resource Optimization & Cost Efficiency
- **Argument**: Current system overspends on unnecessary medical professional involvement
- **Supporting Evidence**: Colon cancer screening comparison (other countries use mail-in samples)
- **Key Question**: Do we need private doctors for basic screening that could be automated/simplified?

### 2. Alternative Screening Models
- **Argument**: Simplified screening processes could maintain quality while reducing costs
- **Supporting Evidence**: International examples (Canada, Netherlands use mail-in stool samples for cancer screening)
- **Information Needed**:
  - Cost comparison between current model and alternative screening methods
  - International best practices for chronic disease screening
  - Technology solutions for remote/automated screening

### 3. Integration of Chinese Medicine
- **Argument**: Include Chinese medicine practitioners in screening and treatment protocols
- **Supporting Evidence**: Upcoming Chinese medicine hospital, traditional approaches to diabetes/hypertension
- **Information Needed**:
  - Chinese medicine diagnostic capabilities for targeted conditions
  - Regulatory framework for integrating TCM in government health schemes
  - Cost comparison between Western and Chinese medicine approaches

### 4. Program Expansion & Scope
- **Argument**: Extend scheme to cover additional chronic diseases (hepatitis B, etc.)
- **Supporting Evidence**: Prevention is more cost-effective than treatment
- **Information Needed**:
  - Cost-benefit analysis of expanding disease coverage
  - Public health priorities and disease burden data
  - Infrastructure requirements for broader screening

## Critical Information to Gather

### Participation & Utilization Data
1. **Participation Rates**: How many eligible people actually join the scheme?
   - Compare with colon cancer scheme (only ~12% participation)
   - Identify barriers to participation
   - Assess if low participation is beneficial given budget constraints

2. **Financial Impact**: 
   - Total government expenditure on the scheme
   - Per-person cost analysis
   - Budget allocation and sustainability concerns

3. **Eligibility Statistics**:
   - Total number of eligible Hong Kong residents (45+ without medical history)
   - Requires cross-referencing with Hospital Authority records
   - Challenge: Unknown number of people with existing conditions

### Program Effectiveness
1. **Diagnostic Outcomes**:
   - How many participants receive positive diagnoses?
   - Follow-up compliance rates
   - Long-term health impact assessment

2. **Healthcare System Impact**:
   - Reduction in emergency treatments
   - Early intervention success rates
   - Overall healthcare cost savings

### Comparative Analysis
1. **International Benchmarking**:
   - How other countries handle chronic disease screening
   - Cost-effectiveness of different models
   - Technology solutions and automation opportunities

2. **Alternative Schemes**:
   - Compare with existing Hong Kong health programs
   - Integration opportunities with other preventive care initiatives

## Research Strategy

### Primary Data Sources
1. **Government Records**: Request participation statistics and financial data
2. **Hospital Authority**: Medical history exclusion data
3. **Health Department**: Program evaluation reports and future planning documents

### Secondary Research
1. **International Comparison**: Best practices in chronic disease prevention
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Economic modeling of alternative approaches
3. **Chinese Medicine Integration**: Regulatory and practical considerations

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Comprehensive Program Research**: Gather detailed information about current scheme operations
2. **Participation Rate Analysis**: Request and analyze enrollment and completion data
3. **Cost Structure Investigation**: Break down government expenditure and per-person costs
4. **Alternative Model Research**: Investigate simplified screening approaches used internationally
5. **Chinese Medicine Feasibility Study**: Explore integration possibilities with upcoming TCM hospital

## Long-term Assessment Areas
- **Program Revision Potential**: Opportunities for scheme optimization
- **Technology Integration**: Digital health solutions for screening
- **Preventive Care Expansion**: Broader chronic disease coverage
- **Healthcare System Integration**: Coordination with existing services
