# Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme - Information Gathering

## Project Overview
**Topic:** Evaluation and Improvement of Hong Kong's Chronic Disease Co-care Model
**Focus:** Assessing effectiveness and scalability of integrated care

## Key Research Questions
1. How effective is the current co-care pilot scheme?
2. What are the barriers to patient participation?
3. How well are public and private sectors coordinating?
4. What are the cost implications of scaling up?
5. How does this compare to international models?

## Information Needed
### Program Performance
- [ ] Patient enrollment and retention rates
- [ ] Health outcome improvements (HbA1c, blood pressure)
- [ ] Patient satisfaction scores
- [ ] Healthcare provider feedback
- [ ] Cost per patient vs. traditional care

### System Analysis
- [ ] Coordination mechanisms between HA and private doctors
- [ ] Information sharing protocols and challenges
- [ ] Training requirements for healthcare providers
- [ ] Quality assurance measures
- [ ] Scaling challenges and opportunities

## Potential Arguments to Develop
1. **Efficiency Argument:** Co-care reduces pressure on public system
2. **Quality Argument:** Integrated care improves patient outcomes
3. **Equity Argument:** Program access should be expanded to more patients
4. **Economic Argument:** Long-term savings justify investment

## Sources to Investigate
- [ ] Hospital Authority performance data
- [ ] Participant feedback surveys
- [ ] Healthcare provider interviews
- [ ] Legislative Council health panel discussions
- [ ] International integrated care studies

## Action Items
- [ ] Interview patients in co-care program
- [ ] Survey private doctors participating
- [ ] Review HA data on program outcomes
- [ ] Compare with integrated care models elsewhere
