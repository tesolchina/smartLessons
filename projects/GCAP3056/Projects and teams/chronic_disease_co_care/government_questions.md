**A2. Diagnostic Outcomes and Health Impact Assessment**
How many new cases of diabetes and hypertension have been identified through the co-care scheme? What follow-up data exists on treatment compliance, health outcomes, and long-term patient management for cases identified through the program?

**A3. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis and Program Evaluation**
What comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis has been conducted for the co-care scheme, including cost per case identified, administrative expenses, and comparison with alternative screening and management approaches? When will systematic program evaluation results be published for public review?

## Questions for Hospital Authority (HA)

### Group B: Public Healthcare Integration and Capacity (3 Questions)

**B1. Public-Private Data Integration and Coordination**
How does the co-care scheme integrate with existing Hospital Authority chronic disease management programs and patient records? What mechanisms exist for sharing patient data and treatment coordination between private co-care providers and public healthcare services?

**B2. Public Healthcare Capacity and Resource Allocation**
How has the co-care scheme affected demand on public healthcare services for chronic disease management? What analysis has been conducted on whether public resources invested in private clinic subsidies could alternatively strengthen public primary care capacity?

**B3. Existing Screening Program Comparison**
How do participation rates, cost-effectiveness, and health outcomes of the co-care scheme compare with Hospital Authority's existing screening programs for colorectal cancer and cervical cancer? What lessons from established programs inform co-care implementation and evaluation?

## Questions for Food and Health Bureau

### Group C: Healthcare Policy Framework and Planning (3 Questions)

**C1. Healthcare Equity and Access Assessment**
What assessment has been conducted on the co-care scheme's impact on healthcare equity, particularly regarding access barriers for elderly, low-income, and geographically isolated populations? How does the program address potential exclusion of vulnerable groups who most need chronic disease screening?

**C2. Public-Private Partnership Strategy and Framework**
What framework governs the evaluation and expansion of public-private healthcare partnerships like the co-care scheme? How does government assess when private clinic subsidies represent optimal resource allocation compared to public healthcare capacity building?

**C3. Alternative Policy Approaches and International Comparison**
What analysis has been conducted comparing the co-care model with alternative approaches to chronic disease prevention and management? How do Hong Kong's results compare with international best practices in population-level chronic disease screening and management?

## Questions for Legislative Council Panel on Health Services

### Group D: Budget Allocation and Legislative Oversight (3 Questions)

**D1. Program Budget and Financial Transparency**
What is the total budget allocation for the Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme, including direct subsidies, administrative costs, and evaluation expenses? How does this investment compare with funding for public healthcare chronic disease management capacity?

**D2. Legislative Oversight and Performance Monitoring**
What mechanisms exist for Legislative Council oversight of co-care program performance and effectiveness? When will comprehensive evaluation results be presented to LegCo for review and public discussion?

**D3. Future Expansion Planning and Budget Implications**
What criteria will determine whether the co-care pilot scheme should be expanded, modified, or discontinued? What budget implications and healthcare system impacts are projected for different program development scenarios?

---

## Questions for Census and Statistics Department

### Group E: Population Health Data and Research Framework (3 Questions)

**E1. Chronic Disease Prevalence and Risk Factor Analysis**
What current data exists on diabetes and hypertension prevalence in Hong Kong's population, including demographic and geographic distribution? How do these baseline statistics inform co-care program targeting and expected impact assessment?

**E2. Healthcare Utilization Patterns and Access Analysis**
What data exists on healthcare utilization patterns for chronic disease management, including barriers to accessing screening and treatment services? How do these patterns inform evaluation of the co-care scheme's accessibility and effectiveness?

**E3. Health Outcome Measurement and Long-term Tracking**
What framework exists for tracking long-term health outcomes and healthcare system impact of chronic disease intervention programs? How can population-level health statistics support evaluation of co-care program effectiveness compared to alternative approaches?

## Strategic Questioning Framework

### Information Gaps These Questions Address:

#### **Program Effectiveness Gaps**:
- Actual participation rates vs. government projections and eligible population estimates
- Diagnostic outcomes and health impact measurement beyond program enrollment numbers
- Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing co-care investment with alternative healthcare approaches

#### **Healthcare System Integration Gaps**:
- Coordination between private co-care providers and public healthcare services
- Impact on public healthcare capacity and resource allocation efficiency
- Integration with existing screening programs and lessons learned from established initiatives

#### **Equity and Access Assessment Gaps**:
- Analysis of access barriers for vulnerable populations and geographic equity
- Assessment of whether program design inadvertently worsens healthcare inequality
- Evaluation of alternative approaches that might better serve population health goals

### Question Strategy Notes:

**Comprehensive Evaluation Focus**: Questions designed to reveal whether systematic program evaluation exists or significant data gaps prevent proper assessment

**Comparative Analysis**: Multiple questions seek comparison with existing programs and alternative approaches to enable evidence-based policy evaluation

**Equity and Access Emphasis**: Specific attention to whether program design addresses or exacerbates healthcare inequality

**Budget and Resource Allocation**: Focus on cost-effectiveness and resource optimization compared to alternative public healthcare investments

**International Benchmarking**: Implicit comparison with global best practices in chronic disease management and program evaluation

## Follow-Up Research Priorities

Based on government responses to these questions, student teams should prioritize:

1. **Participation Analysis**: If government provides enrollment data, conduct detailed analysis of participation patterns and barriers

2. **Cost-Effectiveness Assessment**: Develop independent analysis of program cost per case identified compared to alternative screening approaches

3. **International Comparison**: Research global examples of chronic disease management programs with systematic evaluation and transparent reporting

4. **Healthcare Equity Impact**: Investigate geographic and demographic access patterns to assess program equity implications

5. **Alternative Policy Models**: Analyze different approaches to chronic disease prevention and management for comparison with co-care model

## Information Request Strategy

### Priority FOI Requests:
1. **Detailed participation statistics** including demographic breakdown and geographic distribution
2. **Program budget and expenditure** documentation including administrative costs and subsidy amounts
3. **Diagnostic outcome data** on cases identified and follow-up treatment compliance
4. **Evaluation framework** and timeline for systematic program assessment
5. **Comparison analysis** with existing public screening programs and alternative approaches

### Strategic Request Timing:
- **Initial broad requests** for general program data and evaluation frameworks
- **Targeted follow-up requests** based on initial response gaps and specific data needs
- **Coordination with academic research** to support independent program evaluation and analysis
