## Strategic Questioning Framework

### Information Gaps These Questions Address:

#### **Intelligence-Education Alignment Gaps**:
- Detailed victim demographic data vs. current educational campaign targeting
- Crime pattern analysis vs. educational content development and updating
- Systematic evaluation of campaign effectiveness vs. resource allocation decisions

#### **Technology Innovation and Implementation Gaps**:
- Hong Kong's anti-scam technology capabilities vs. regional and international innovations
- Cross-border learning opportunities and cooperation frameworks
- Integration between different government agencies and private sector anti-fraud efforts

#### **Evidence-Based Policy Development Gaps**:
- Data-driven approaches to educational campaign development and evaluation
- Technology procurement and innovation strategies for fraud prevention
- Coordination between law enforcement intelligence and public education initiatives

### Question Strategy Notes:

**Multi-Agency Coordination Focus**: Questions span multiple government departments to reveal coordination challenges and information sharing gaps

**Evidence-Based Policy Emphasis**: Specific focus on how crime intelligence informs education and technology policy development

**Technology Innovation Priority**: Multiple questions address Hong Kong's technology lag and learning opportunities from successful regional implementations

**Systematic Evaluation Requirements**: Emphasis on measurement, evaluation, and continuous improvement frameworks

**Cross-Border Learning Opportunities**: Specific attention to regional cooperation and adaptation of successful approaches

## Follow-Up Research Priorities

Based on government responses to these questions, student teams should prioritize:

1. **Campaign-Data Alignment Analysis**: If government provides demographic data, conduct detailed analysis of educational targeting vs. actual victim patterns

2. **Technology Gap Assessment**: Compare Hong Kong's anti-scam technology capabilities with successful regional implementations

3. **International Best Practices Research**: Develop comprehensive comparison with jurisdictions showing declining fraud rates through evidence-based approaches

4. **Resource Allocation Effectiveness**: Analyze government spending on education vs. technology vs. enforcement for anti-scam efforts

5. **Cross-Border Cooperation Opportunities**: Research successful regional cooperation models and potential applications to Hong Kong context

## Information Request Strategy

### Priority FOI Requests:
1. **Detailed crime statistics** including victim demographics by scam type and methodology analysis
2. **Educational campaign evaluation data** and effectiveness measurement frameworks
3. **Technology procurement and development** budgets and strategic planning documents
4. **Cross-border cooperation** agreements and information sharing protocols
5. **Industry coordination** frameworks and private sector anti-fraud requirement compliance

### Strategic Request Timing:
- **Broad intelligence requests** to establish baseline understanding of crime patterns and victim demographics
- **Targeted evaluation requests** focusing on specific gaps between intelligence and education approaches
- **Technology and innovation requests** to understand policy frameworks and investment priorities
- **Coordination and cooperation requests** to assess multi-agency and cross-border collaboration effectiveness

### Expected Response Patterns:
- **Security considerations**: Some requests may receive limited responses due to operational security concerns
- **Data availability**: Government may claim detailed demographic data is not systematically collected or analyzed
- **Technology sensitivity**: Specific anti-scam technology capabilities may be considered operationally sensitive
- **Coordination gaps**: Responses may reveal lack of systematic coordination between agencies or absence of comprehensive evaluation frameworks
