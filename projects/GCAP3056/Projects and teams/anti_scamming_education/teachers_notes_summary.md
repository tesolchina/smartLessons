# Anti-Scamming Education Emergency Alert System - Teacher's Notes Summary

## Project Focus Areas

### 1. Reporting Mechanism Analysis
- **Current Challenge**: Reporting channels to police appear complex and not user-friendly
- **Research Target**: Anti-deception Coordination Agency website and reporting procedures
- **Key Question**: How convenient and accessible are current reporting channels for scam victims?

### 2. Comparative Analysis: Hong Kong vs Mainland China
- **Opportunity**: Both regions have anti-scam mobile applications
- **Research Approach**: Comparative analysis of app features, functionality, and effectiveness
- **Potential Outcomes**: Identify best practices Hong Kong could adopt from mainland China's approach

### 3. Police Data & Collaboration
- **Data Request Strategy**: Approach police for detailed scam statistics and classifications
- **Expected Resources**: Comprehensive taxonomy of scam types and victim demographics
- **Teacher's Insight**: Police are responsive and collaborative with academic inquiries

## Potential Arguments to Develop

### 1. Reporting System Optimization
- **Argument**: Current scam reporting mechanisms are unnecessarily complex and deter victims from reporting
- **Supporting Evidence**: Analysis of reporting pathway complexity and user experience
- **Information Needed**:
  - Step-by-step analysis of current reporting process
  - User feedback on reporting experience
  - Comparison with simplified reporting systems
  - Time required for report completion
  - Follow-up procedures and victim support

### 2. Technology Integration & App Enhancement
- **Argument**: Hong Kong's anti-scam app could be improved by adopting successful features from mainland China
- **Supporting Evidence**: Comparative feature analysis and user adoption rates
- **Information Needed**:
  - Detailed feature comparison between HK and mainland apps
  - User adoption and engagement statistics
  - Effectiveness metrics for different app functionalities
  - User feedback and satisfaction ratings
  - Technical capabilities and integration possibilities

### 3. Data-Driven Education Campaign Improvement
- **Argument**: Current education campaigns could be more targeted based on detailed scam data analysis
- **Supporting Evidence**: Comprehensive scam taxonomy and victim profiling
- **Information Needed**:
  - Detailed scam type classifications and frequency data
  - Victim demographic breakdowns (age, education, profession, etc.)
  - Financial loss patterns by scam type
  - Temporal patterns (seasonal trends, peak times)
  - Geographic distribution of scam incidents

### 4. Emergency Alert System Enhancement
- **Argument**: Real-time alert systems could prevent scams more effectively than post-incident education
- **Supporting Evidence**: Analysis of current alert timing and effectiveness
- **Information Needed**:
  - Current alert system capabilities and response times
  - Effectiveness of existing warning systems
  - Integration possibilities with mobile networks
  - Real-time threat detection capabilities
