# Anti-Scamming Education Emergency Alert System - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Objective (Simon's Strategic Framework)

> **"Begin with the end in mind"** - The core research question is: **Do current educational campaigns align with actual scam case data?**

### Key Research Focus Areas (Simon's Direction):
1. **Campaign-Data Alignment**: Assess whether current educational approaches target the right scam types and demographics based on actual crime statistics
2. **Cross-Border Learning**: Compare Hong Kong and Mainland China approaches - focus on **what Hong Kong can learn** rather than determining which is "better"
3. **Evidence-Based Improvement**: Review existing educational campaigns and protective measures to identify gaps and opportunities

## 📋 Student Action Plan

### ✅ Completed Tasks (Week 1-2):
1. **🔍 Media Research** (Completed)
   - Search Legislative Council (LegCo) documents for scam-related discussions
   - Review SCMP coverage of recent scam cases and trends
   - **AI-assisted** systematic search and analysis of media coverage patterns

2. **📱 Technology Assessment** (Completed)
   - Download and analyze Hong Kong's anti-scam applications
   - Research Mainland China's anti-scam app features and capabilities
   - Document comparative feature analysis

3. **🌐 Website Evaluation** (Completed)
   - Analyze reporting mechanisms and user experience
   - Map current educational campaign materials and strategies

### 🔄 Current Week (Week 3):
4. **🎯 Information Gap Analysis** (ONGOING - Phase 1 Completion)
   - **Primary Goal**: Identify what information is NOT publicly available
   - Review all gathered public data to pinpoint specific gaps
   - Formulate targeted questions for government information requests
   - **Key Focus**: What data would strengthen arguments about campaign-data misalignment?
   - **Complete Phase 1**: Finalize public data collection and analysis

### 📝 Next Week (Week 4) - Government Information Requests:
5. **📊 Strategic Data Requests**
   - Submit Freedom of Information requests to Hong Kong Police Force
   - Request specific non-public data from Anti-deception Coordination Centre
   - Target information that will reveal gaps between public campaigns and actual crime patterns
   - **Motivation**: Raise questions that expose information asymmetries

### 🎯 Critical Information Gaps to Target (Week 4 Requests):

#### **High-Priority Non-Public Data:**
1. **Detailed Victim Demographics by Scam Type**
   - Age, education, income brackets for each scam category
   - **Gap**: Public reports only show general statistics, not detailed breakdowns that would inform targeted campaigns

2. **Campaign Effectiveness Metrics**
   - Actual measurement of educational campaign impact
   - Pre/post campaign scam rates by targeted demographics
   - **Gap**: No public data on whether campaigns reduce specific scam types

3. **Unreported Case Estimates**
   - Police estimates of actual vs. reported scam incidents
   - Reasons why victims don't report (survey data)
   - **Gap**: True scale of scam problem likely underestimated in public figures

4. **Inter-agency Coordination Data**
   - How different agencies share scam intelligence
   - Decision-making process for campaign focus areas
   - **Gap**: Public doesn't know how campaign priorities are set

#### **Strategic Questions for Government Requests:**
- "What criteria determine which scam types receive priority in educational campaigns?"
- "How do you measure the effectiveness of current anti-scam education initiatives?"
- "What percentage of scam victims never report incidents, and why?"
- "How does victim demographic data influence campaign design and targeting?"

### 🔍 Follow-up Research (Week 5-6):
6. **📋 Response Analysis & Gap Documentation**
   - Analyze government responses and identify information still withheld
   - Document systematic gaps between public campaigns and actual data
   - Prepare evidence for policy recommendations

## 💡 Research Hypotheses (Arguments to Develop)

### Hypothesis 1: Campaign-Data Misalignment
**Argument**: Current education campaigns may not target the most prevalent scam types or vulnerable demographics based on actual crime data
**Test**: Compare educational content focus vs. actual scam statistics by type and victim profile

### Hypothesis 2: Technology Gap
**Argument**: Hong Kong's anti-scam technology could be enhanced by adopting successful features from mainland China's approach
**Test**: Feature-by-feature comparison and user adoption analysis

### Hypothesis 3: Reporting Barriers
**Argument**: Complex reporting mechanisms deter victims from reporting, leading to underestimation of scam prevalence
**Test**: User experience analysis of reporting pathways and victim feedback
