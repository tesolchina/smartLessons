I am teaching GCAP 3056 again this semester

will meet with students tomorrow (week 2); still add-drop period

I've got Zoom scripts from week 1 /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3056/0notes.md

~~let's set up an html file for moodle forum to summarize week 1 large font size- visually appealing no fancy js or css~~ âœ…

let's plan for week 2 a bit 

we'll first talk a bit about the group communication mechanism through Moodle and Google drive 

so we need to set up a folder in Google drive 

here is the note https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqrraqaRkANg9r0jArxvx7_W2xo0QlSCvDRYXdWvQ0o/edit?tab=t.0 which we need to check this doc and move it over here https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1h1KDGUtGCHL2EsS-LKLbZZhjmVNn8GmM

then we need to create a google form for group leader to fill out to provide a topic preference and group membership, name, major, gmail address, student ID this google form should be linked to a folder to be created

give me instructions to set up google form API

have we got google form already 

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating/GoogleDocsAPI should leverage and update codes here

~~/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3056/materials got a lot of pDF to process into md and send to LLM for clean up and summary~~ âœ…

~~we need folders for each week 1-13 and a md planning docs in each folder based on syllabus and timeline~~ âœ…
~~there should also be assessment folder with md on instructions and rubrics for each assessment task~~ âœ…
