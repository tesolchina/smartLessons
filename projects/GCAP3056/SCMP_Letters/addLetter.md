## Current Status ‚úÖ

I can successfully read the **full content** of letters from your Notion database! The letters are stored as paragraph blocks, not just metadata.

### Test Results:

We refer to ‚ÄúNo deal, no answers: Trump-Putin summit ends with ‚Äòprogress made‚Äô‚Äù ([August 15](https://www.scmp.com/news/us/diplomacy/article/3322061/trump-putin-soon-sit-down-high-stakes-ukraine-talks-alaska?module=inline&pgtype=article)).

In the light of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Alaska summit over the future of Ukraine, it may be worth considering an unusual, even intriguing historical parallel. Alaska‚Äôs peaceful transfer from Russia to the United States in 1867 is not often discussed in the context of today‚Äôs territorial conflicts.

Indeed, the analogy is far from straightforward ‚Äì Alaska was transferred by mutual agreement and purchase, whereas Ukraine‚Äôs contested regions have been seized and annexed through force, with their status fiercely disputed by all sides.

Still, history can sometimes offer food for thought. The purchase of Alaska for US$7.2 million stands as a rare example of a major territorial change that was wrought without violence, through negotiation rather than war. In contrast, the proposed ‚Äúland swaps‚Äù for Ukraine risk pressuring one side into making concessions and raise difficult questions about sovereignty, legitimacy and international law. There is no easy blueprint: international practice has long varied, and the voices and wishes of local populations have not always shaped outcomes.

In recalling the historical episode, we are not suggesting there is a simple solution to today‚Äôs crisis ‚Äì rather, we would like to invite reflection on the value of diplomacy, the importance of consent and the dangers of imposing settlements by sheer force or great power politics. In a complex world, history can sometimes illuminate a path forward, but only if we approach an issue with humility and care.
