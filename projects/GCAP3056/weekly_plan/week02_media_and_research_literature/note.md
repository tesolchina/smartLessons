========sth to remember =======

I'll write some to-do item or request; once it is done, please strike out and update progress

do not write too much; stay concise

there are tools here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating you might use to access Google docs, slides and to call API to consult LLM

always write scripts in files not through termianls - the files should be placed in the operating folder for future use

when working please break down the tasks - perform one task that should not take too long at a time

==================== current task=================

do not edit this section

let's work on the project ideas

there should be a folder in Google

**1. Hong Kong Observatory Chatbot [https://accessinfo.hk/request/questions_about_dr_tin_chatbot](https://accessinfo.hk/request/questions_about_dr_tin_chatbot)

locate publicly available info

- we need to visit the homepage and experience the chatbot first hand and note its strength and weaknesses
- we should search for media coverage and HKO's social media
