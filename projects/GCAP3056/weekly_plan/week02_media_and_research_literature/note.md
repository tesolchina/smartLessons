========sth to remember =======

I'll write some to-do item or request; once it is done, please strike out and update progress

do not write too much; stay concise

there are tools here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating you might use to access Google docs, slides and to call API to consult LLM

always write scripts in files not through termianls - the files should be placed in the operating folder for future use


====================

I need help to prepare some Moodle forum post 

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3056/materials/Course Expectations Overview_otter_ai.txt

one recap based on the note above as well as /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3056/materials/md_converted 

it should be a rich nicely formatted html file that is suitable for Moodle forum (no fancy JS or CSS); font size should be large maybe just to revise this one 

we should have a folder for such html
