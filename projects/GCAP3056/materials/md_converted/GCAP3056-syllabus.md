7. AIMS & OBJECTIVES
This is an experiential learning course.
This course aims to help our students engage with public discourse on important social
problems facing our local and global society. It introduces an interdisciplinary approach
to analyzing social problems, encouraging students to draw upon research insights and
knowledge from different disciplines and share their insights with stakeholders such as the
Hong Kong (HK) government, NGOs and the public. Addressing a range of social issues
facing Hong Kong and the wider global community, students learn to glean research
insights from academic literature, to collect information from the HK government under
the Code on Access to Information and join the debate on such issues through
experiential learning activities such as discussion with representatives from NGOs and/or
community members and writing for the media. Working collaboratively in small groups,
students will critically review the policies and decisions made by the HK government and
propose new solutions for social problems taking into account findings from their own
research together with literature on the issues and/or policy ideas from other countries or
cities. Students will eventually develop insightful and persuasive arguments on the
issues and share their findings with the stakeholders including the HK government and the

public through a variety of channels, including writing letters to the editor and opinion
pieces in the newspapers, submitting reports to the HK government and engaging
members of the community through online and offline activities. Moreover, the
experiential learning provided by this course will facilitate meaningful connections
between students and practitioners in the field to explore internship and/or employment
opportunities.
8. COURSE CONTENT
WEEKS ONE-TWO: Introductory Sessions
WEEK ONE-The Hong Kong SAR Government (TLA: 1) (3 hours)
This topic introduces the overall structure and organisation of the Hong Kong SAR
government. It includes the principles of transparency and accountability of the
government, communication and complaint channels, the Ombudsman, Code on Access to
Information, and the judicial review of government decisions. Students will learn how to
initiate a conversation with various government departments and bureaus and the
community (incl. NGOs and members of the public) regarding specific social issues
through applying the skills of analyzing and interpreting quantitative and qualitative data
from the government and other sources. In groups, students will begin to identify a social
issue they would like to work on and draw up a plan for their project.

WEEK TWO-Media and research literature on social issues (TLA: 1) (3 hours)
Students will explore the complex relationships between the public and academic
communities, shaped by the ways social and research issues are debated in mass-
media. This will provide students the opportunity to investigate how researchers could
influence the public opinions through media engagement. Students will also consider the
challenges of communicating research insights to the public with limited background
knowledge and explore strategies and skills for effective communication with the
public.

CILO By the end of the course, students should be able to:
CILO 1 Synthesise and critically analyse data/information/viewpoints gathered from
various stakeholders including the HKSAR government, NGOs, and the public
regarding social problems, so as to develop and support actionable policy
recommendations;
CILO 2 Collaborate with peers from multiple backgrounds and draw on research
articles from multiple disciplines to develop wide-ranging insights into the
discourses and power relations informing social problems facing Hong Kong
and global society;
CILO 3 Recognise and evaluate value principles in public discourse so as to make more
informed and knowledgeable decisions in the development of rhetorical
strategies for arguments on pressing social issues;
CILO 4 Apply knowledge and insights gained from research activities by writing for the
public as informed citizen-scholars via newspaper articles, reports to the HK
government and social media campaigns.
10. TEACHING & LEARNING ACTIVITIES (TLAs)

## Page 6

CILO Type of TLA
alignment
CILO 1, 4 1. Experiential Learning Project
Students will work in small groups to develop insights and arguments on a
particular social issue facing Hong Kong via research and community
engagement. This will not only involve a review of relevant literature but
also collecting insights and data from the government, community leaders
(NGOs) and/or community members through fieldwork. They will share
their findings with stakeholders and the public through various channels
such as writing letters to the Editor, opinion pieces in newspapers/online
media, social media campaigns and policy recommendation reports.
Interactive lectures and consultation sessions will help guide the students
towards the effective realisation of their project. The following TLAs are
also in this way directed towards the processes and outcomes of this
project.
CILO 2, 3 2. Seminars and guest speaker forums
Seminars on current social issues in Hong Kong which will also include
presentations by guest speakers, e.g. NGO representatives, to share their
values, experiences and perspectives. Some seminars may be delivered as
video screencasts or podcasts through a flipped classroom approach so the
classroom contact hours can be spent on small group discussion. Students
will prepare for these through research; by reading assigned materials and
outlining their responses and thoughts via discussion questions. During the
seminars, the students will share their ideas on these issues, interact with
guest speakers and identify areas for further investigation for their own
projects.
CILO 2, 3 3. Writing workshops using digital tools and social editors
Writing workshops will be held for students to practice the skills of
contacting government and community leaders (NGO) and members of the
public, and, in addition, writing persuasively. Group writing projects will be
facilitated by social editors such as Google docs and online platforms such
as Padlet and Google sites. These activities will be channelled into building
an online collaborative community of "writers for the public" where
materials and resources will be shared e.g. a Facebook group.
CILO 2, 4 4. Community engagement activities
Students will set up booths on campus, for example on the Li Promenade,
to share their finished projects with members of the university community
and the public. Students will showcase the work done for their project, e.g.
newspaper articles, reports for the government, pictures from field trips,
and records of online engagement.

## Page 7

Methods
Argumentati 25 % 1, 2, 3 Small groups of students will work together to
ve Research write a short argumentative research paper that
Paper will critically review the government policies and
(group) offer policy recommendations; the paper can
then be adapted into different forms as reports
to the government, letters to the editor, social
media posts and oral presentations
Community 40 % 1, 2, 4 Students may choose to engage the community
engagement in different ways including writing for the
portfolio newspaper, preparing reports for the
(group) government, designing and launching persuasive
campaigns on social media; students should
work in groups to build the community
engagement portfolios to document their roles in
the team efforts of engaging the community. The
portfolio should include the following three
compulsory items:
1. Evidence of requesting information from the
government and/or community
leaders/members
2. Evidence of writing for the public, e.g.
newspaper articles, government reports or social
media posts
3. An infographic or a video clip making the
argument
Reflective 35 % 2, 3, 4 Students should keep a multimodal learning
learning journal through writing, voice-recording and/or
journal filming to reflect on the learning processes. The
(individual) drafts of these journals should be shared in a
discussion board in Moodle where peer learning
can take place. Students will be evaluated based
on the depth of their reflection as well as the
breadth of their contribution to the discussion
board.
