government policies and offer policy recommendations; the paper can then be adapted into different forms as reports to
the government, letters to the editor, social media posts and oral presentations
Community engagement portfolio- group work (40%)
Students may choose to engage the community in different ways including writing for the newspaper, preparing reports
for the government, designing and launching persuasive campaigns on social media; students should work in groups to
build the community engagement portfolios to document their roles in the team efforts of engaging the community. The
2
portfolio should include the following three compulsory items:
1. Evidence of requesting information from the government and/or community leaders/members
2. Evidence of writing for the public, e.g. newspaper articles, government reports or social media posts
3. An infographic or a video clip making the argument
Reflective learning journal- individual work (35%)
Students should keep a multimodal learning journal through writing, voice-recording and/or filming to reflect on the

learning processes. The drafts of these journals should be shared in a discussion board in Moodle where peer learning can
take place. Students will be evaluated based on the depth of their reflection as well as the breadth of their contribution to
the discussion board.
