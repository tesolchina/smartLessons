Letter published on 120th anniversary of SCMP
Letter | Letters bridge the space between the public and the ivory tower
As a frequent contributor to this column, I wish to congratulate the South China Morning Post on its 120th anniversary and thank the
editors for their support for my research and advocacy work in the past 10 years.
I started writing to the Letters section in 2013 and have published over 100 letters. Since 2020, I have also been working with my colleague,
Dr Benedict Rowlett, at Baptist University, helping over 300 students to publish nearly 140 letters.
My first published letter to the editor was on Creative Commons, an alternative approach to copyright management. In my first featured
letter in 2016, I made the case for Hong Kong to phase out Octopus cards and imagined a smart city embracing diverse mobile payment
methods. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence, my students and I also published the first letter in SCMP9s history that was
edited by ChatGPT. An overarching theme of most of our letters is to question the status quo and envision a better world made possible by
new technologies.
The letters column offers us opportunities to critically review the decisions made by the Hong Kong government. Through researching
public policy matters, including citing the Code on Access to Information, we have published letters on a wide range of issues such as the
emergency alert system, national security law and solar weather. Occasionally, government staff, for example, the Department of
Justice and Hong Kong Observatory, would write in response.
Our conversation with the government extended beyond the newspaper. We met Legislative Council members including Chan Kin-por,
Alice Mak Mei-kuen, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Tse Wai-chuen, and brought their attention to the challenges facing groups whose
voices are less often heard. The letters section lets us share our conversations with lawmakers and create additional pressure for
government action.
It is also a bridge between the public and the ivory tower. I have co-authored letters with research students to share insights from Baptist
University research teams on Chinese medicine and carbon emission monitoring. Recently, Dr Rowlett and I have received support from
the General Research Fund to study how citizenship has been exercised by SCMP letter writers. This research could never have been
realised without the unwavering commitment of SCMP editors to nurturing a dynamic community of readers and cultivating an invaluable
platform for public discourse.

Amid Covid-19 travel restrictions, Carrie Lam must
keep her promise to help cross-border students
Letter | Carrie Lam must keep her promise to help cross-border students
As a concern group advocating for over 27,000 cross-border schoolchildren, we have been deeply disappointed with the Education Bureau staff
who have done virtually nothing to help this group of Hong Kong residents during the pandemic. Through the Legislative Council Redress
System, we held a meeting with Ms Alice Mak Mei-kuen, the deputy chairperson of the Legco panel on education, on September 2.
Before our meeting, we invited parents of cross-border schoolchildren to voice their concerns through a WeChat blog and make suggestions on
how the government can better support the children. The blog entry was overwhelmed by parents9 messages calling for more action from the
governments of both Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
While the majority of them hope the government could exempt cross-border schoolchildren from the quarantine requirements, they also
understand this is unlikely to happen in the near future. A more realistic solution, according to the parents, is to set up learning centres in
Shenzhen where the children can take online classes together and learn more effectively through peer interaction.
Moreover, they suggested that the cross-border schoolchildren should be taught separately from their local peers as teachers often struggled to
look after students online and offline at the same time.
During the meeting with Ms Mak, we summarised the parents9 concerns and suggestions, and asked the lawmaker to follow up with the
Education Bureau. Ms Mak agreed that bringing the schoolchildren together for online lessons was a feasible proposal that the government
should further explore.
We also contacted International Social Service (ISS), an NGO with funding support from the government to serve cross-border schoolchildren.
The ISS staff shared our concerns and expressed their interest in running learning centres for the schoolchildren if resources are available from
the government.
On September 8, Ms Mak raised this issue during the Legislative Council question and answer meeting with Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng
Yuet-ngor on our behalf. In response to her question, Mrs Lam promised that the Education Bureau would look into how to set up learning
centres for the schoolchildren in Shenzhen.
We hope the bureau can take swift action and work with the NGOs such as ISS to create a more productive learning environment for those who
cannot come to Hong Kong for school.

Letter | How Hong Kong Observatory promotes awareness of space weather
Hong Kong Observatory promotes awareness of space weather
through various channels
I refer to the letter from Cheng Ding and Simon Wang <Why Hong Kong should not take its eyes off the sun= (March 2) regarding space
weather. We are grateful that your readers paid attention to the potential impacts of severe space weather events.
Unlike atmospheric weather that affects our daily life on a local scale, space weather often refers to the changing electromagnetic conditions
in near-Earth space, caused mainly by the sun, the impacts of which are mostly on a global or regional scale, in particular high latitude areas.
Despite a relatively low risk for Hong Kong being directly affected by adverse space weather due to its low latitude, the Hong Kong
Observatory is always on the alert and regularly monitors space weather.
We provide the latest information on space weather to special users, in particular, the aviation community when impacts to flight operations
are expected. Moreover, the Observatory has close partnerships with the energy sector to enhance the resilience of energy infrastructure to
various natural hazards, including the potential influence of space weather events to the power grids in Hong Kong. So far, there has been no
strong evidence showing that space weather events have caused power outages in Hong Kong.
The Observatory also spares no effort in promoting education on space weather to the public. We first launched a space weather webpage in
2004 to heighten public interest in and awareness of this phenomenon. We further enriched the webpage in 2010, specifically relaying the
latest space weather alerts from the US and particularly promoting it to government departments and utilities to prompt relevant parties to
take appropriate and timely precautions, as necessary, before the solar cycle of about 11 years reaching the forecast maximum around 2012-
14.
This year, a new version of the Observatory9s space weather webpage is almost ready to be launched with more information and an attractive
design, including some historical events, and easy access to the three-day space weather forecasts provided by the National Centre for Space
Weather of China. In addition, a children9s version of the space weather webpage will be added to the My Little Observatory website with
interactive quiz games, raising children9s interest in space.
Other promotion channels also include educational resources, video production, radio programmes, public talks and our open day. The
theme of the Observatory9s open day this year, to be held on March 23-24, is <The sun, the Earth and the weather=. Members of the public are
most welcome to visit us to learn more about space weather. Please rest assured that the Observatory will continue to keep abreast of the
latest developments in space weather and provide timely and relevant services to users concerned.

The course syllabus
Assessment
ÿ 
Argumentative Research Paper- group work 25%
Small groups of students will work together to write a short argumentative research paper that will critically review the
1
government policies and offer policy recommendations; the paper can then be adapted into different forms as reports to the
government, letters to the editor, social media posts and oral presentations
Community engagement portfolio- group work (40%)
Students may choose to engage the community in different ways including writing for the newspaper, preparing reports for
the government, designing and launching persuasive campaigns on social media; students should work in groups to build
the community engagement portfolios to document their roles in the team efforts of engaging the community. The portfolio
2
should include the following three compulsory items:
1. Evidence of requesting information from the government and/or community leaders/members
2. Evidence of writing for the public, e.g. newspaper articles, government reports or social media posts
3. An infographic or a video clip making the argument
Reflective learning journal- individual work (35%)
Students should keep a multimodal learning journal through writing, voice-recording and/or filming to reflect on the
3
learning processes. The drafts of these journals should be shared in a discussion board in Moodle where peer learning can
take place. Students will be evaluated based on the depth of their reflection as well as the breadth of their contribution to
the discussion board.

System prompt of the chatbot Analyze_letter
You are an experienced discourse analyst and an expert on public policies. Your job is to serve as a consultant for a General Education
course "Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations" and guide the students (user) to analyze a letter to the
editor provided by the user. After the user provide the letter, you should first check if the letter is related to government policy. If it is not,
you should tell the user to find another letter about government policies. If it is, you should present the following options
1. Explore the context of the problem
2. Describe the stakeholders and the problem
3. Review data collection and analysis
4. Build and evaluate the arguments
5. Increase impact on the society
When option 1 is selected, you should first present the relevant text in the letter that describe the context and the background of the
problem and ask the user if they have any prior knowledge or experience about this background. The purpose is to activate the users'
background knowledge and to engage them by bringing up some familiar experience. Then you should also ask the users how the
authors contextualize the issue and explore with the users the strategies used by the authors to frame the issue.
When option 2 is selected, you should first present the relevant text in the letter that describe the stakeholders and the problem. You
should ask the users to identify the problem and the stakeholders and discuss different ways to formulate this problem. You should
offer the users various options for further discussion. The purpose is to help the users to deepen their understanding of the problem and
how the stakeholders are affected.
When option 3 is selected, you should first present the relevant text in the letter that present relevant data, both qualitative and
quantitative. You should ask the users to identify what data is publicly available and what is from the government upon request (under
the Code on Access to Information). This is not always easy to tell. So you should encourage the users to consult Dr Simon Wang who
has got the records of government communication for the projects.
When option 4 or option 5 is selected, tell the users these options are not yet available and encourage them to come back later.
When the user types done, you should summarize the key points covered in the discussion and ask the user to rate the overall
usefulness of the conversation: 5 very useful & 1 least useful.

1 Background Information:
Provide a detailed description of the context, connecting the issue to the ongoing conversations about policies and public affairs for
Hong Kong
Explain the relevance of the issue to both Hong Kong and potentially broader contexts.
please let the teacher know which student is working on this part and share relevant info in Google docs. Same for other steps.
Step 2: A different group member should select option 2 and first share the summary from step 1.
2 Identification of the Problem:
Clearly define the problem that needs addressing.
Discuss its implications on the community, government, and other relevant stakeholders.
Note that we are reviewing an existing solution to a problem not a problem facing the existing solution (weaknesses of the
solution). For example, the problem the Emergency Alert System addresses is the lack of an efficient way to broadcast
emergency messages to the HK public.
Step 3: A different group member should select option 3 and first share the summary from step 2.
3 Information Gathering:
Compile information from publicly available sources to establish a baseline understanding of the issue.
Actively request and incorporate information from government sources to provide a comprehensive view of current efforts and
policies.
Remember you will have the opportunities to contact the government departments and bureax for more info. But it is
essential for you to do your homework first.
Note that the government staff will usually reply to our Code on Access to Information requests in 3 weeks. Yet, they may need
more time and reply after 49 days. Try to avoid asking more than 3 questions in one request.
Discuss with the AI tutor what questions could be raised for the government staff.

students taking the course this semester (Spring 2025) are invited to contribute to this book project.
1 Contextualization and Problem Identification
Consider the context and the background including the relevant news stories. Define the specific problem and its impact
on stakeholders. Work in pairs and talk to the chatbot and share your chat histories in the Google docs
The ultimate goal is to write a section of a book chapter. We should discuss the chat histories and explore how to improve
the system prompt and continue the conversation to achieve our goals. Your reflection and comments should focus on
learning- permanent changes in beliefs and behaviors.
Key questions to answer
1. What is the news event that triggers the project?
2. Who are the stakeholders?
3. What are at stake? Whose interests are affected? What value principles are evoked?
4. What is the problem? What went wrong and how could it be fixed?
5. What is the existing solution?

words first; you should then provide feedback and offer insights and guidance making reference to excerpts from the
letter. You may also suggest some questions that the student may ask. After some discussion, you can move on to the
next question. There are a total of 6 questions for discussion. The student may type done anytime. Once s/he types
done, you should provide a summary of what has been discussed in Q&A format and ask the student to rate the
overall usefulness of the chat (5 very useful & 1 least useful).
Here are the 6 questions
1. What is the news event that triggers the project?
2. Who are the stakeholders?
3. What are at stake? Whose interests are affected? What value principles are evoked?
4. What is the problem? What went wrong and how could it be fixed?
5. What is the existing solution?
6. What are the techniques and strategies about framing and identifying the problem that we can learn from the
letter authors?
