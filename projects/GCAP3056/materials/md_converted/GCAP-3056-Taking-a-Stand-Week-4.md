Clearly define the problem that needs addressing.
Discuss its implications on the community, government, and other relevant stakeholders.

Actively request and incorporate information from government sources to provide a comprehensive view of current
efforts and policies.
4. Critical Review of Existing Solutions:
Analyze existing government policies and community efforts.
Evaluate their effectiveness, shortcomings, and the gap between intended and actual outcomes.
5. Incorporation of Scholarly Insights: (optional)
Although optional, integrating academic research can provide depth, backing up the problem identification and
critique of existing solutions with empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks.
Highlight any relevant models or theories that could inform better practices.
6. Argument for Government Action (Recommendations):
Based on the gathered information and critical analysis, propose well-founded solutions or enhancements to existing
policies.
Justify why these actions are expected to be effective, feasible, and sustainable.

Suggest concrete steps or campaigns that can mobilize public support and pressure the government to implement the
recommendations.

Beyond writing for the South China Morning Post (SCMP), consider other avenues to maintain pressure and visibility,
such as:
Organizing public forums or webinars with stakeholders to discuss the findings and recommendations.
Engaging in social media campaigns to gather public support and share information widely.
Collaborating with NGOs to create advocacy campaigns or provide platforms for further dissemination and
discussion.

Enquiry and reply
initial enquiry 23 Sept 2024
Dear Sir/Madam
I am writing to express my concern over the growing number of HK residents especially seniors who use Heung Yuen Wai
checkpoint due to the low cost of transportation.
Please kindly provide the latest figures about the usage of the checkpoint and the no of passengers taking buses there to help
review the situation. Please also review the capacity of checkpoints of both sides. My request of information is not precise at
this time but I hope we can get the conversation started among me as a concerned citizen , Immigration Department and
Transport Department. I also copy this email to HK police force and invite the force to assess the safety conditions of the
checkpoint.
Thanks in advance for your attention to this matter.
Yours sincerely
Simon Wang
Communicate with GDTEO
Dear Dr Wang,
I refer to your email dated 24.9.2024 please. As far as we understand, the relevant bureaux/departments of HKSARG have
established mechanism and maintained frequent contact with Shenzhen border checkpoints to ensure the smooth and
efficient passenger traffic for all passengers. Noting that your request comes under this ambit, we trust that the matter will be
taken care of accordingly. We will consider the appropriate follow up action, as deemed necessary, if our assistance is required.
Thank you.
Regards,
Agnes Siu
DD(SZLU)
Dear Ms Siu
Referring to my email addressing Immigration Department and Transport Department, I'd like to bring your attention to this
matter and invite you to contact the Shenzhen immigration control unit in charge of Liantang checkpoint to review the usage
data. Since many of the passengers are elderly, I am sure you agree with me that we should take actions to protect their safety
and well-beings.
Thanks in advance for your help.
Your sincerely
Simon WANG
Communicate with TD
Dear Sir/Madam
Thanks for the reply.
- Please confirm the concerned buses route is CTB B7, CTB B8 and KMB B9
The TD team should know which bus and/or other public transportation routes are concerned.
1. An important data point to review is the percentage of passengers who enjoyed the HKD2 discounts for elderly; if it is
higher than usual, maybe the team needs to consider if something needs to be done.
2. Another issue to consider is whether the bus companies have deployed more vehicles since the opening of the
checkpoints and in what ways the deployment of these vehicles may impact the operations of the checkpoints on both
sides.
Grateful if a specific team within TD could email me directly to discuss further and relevant info could be provided under the
Code on Access to Information.
Cheers
Simon Wang
