1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:10.110
classroom: Alright, so, I think, we're gonna wait for a few more minutes. Maybe a few more students will join us, because I've got…

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:21.870
classroom: 25 students enrolled in this course, have a full house. I don't know how many will show up. So while we're waiting, I'd like to, share with you a letter

3
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.310
classroom: That was published.

4
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.539
classroom: Let me check.

5
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.009
classroom: 2021! That was when you were…

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:48.490
classroom: Still in the high school, right? 2021. Yeah, I, you know, these days, I keep, showing people the article I wrote many years ago. Like, this one is, like, 4 years ago. Anyway,

7
00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:02.339
classroom: if you look at… because I know many of you are from Chinese medicine, right? Raise your hand if you're from Chinese medicine. Yeah, okay. So we have a special session for Chinese medicine. So that's why I show this letter to you.

8
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.840
classroom: The title is How Hong Kong Can Apply Traditional Chinese Medicine in Fight Against Chronic Disease.

9
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:21.519
classroom: And you can see there's some summary line here. The health department strategy focusing on specific risk factors rather than holistic health management.

10
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:37.159
classroom: the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are able to customize health recommendations to individual constitutions and needs. So that's a very classical point about the difference between the Chinese medicine and the Western medicine, right? Because

11
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:48.000
classroom: the Chinese citizens take a more holistic, approach. And also, you know, take into consideration the individualized, individual constitution. So.

12
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.549
classroom: This letter…

13
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.570
classroom: Another reason why I want to show you this letter is because it was the collaboration between me and,

14
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.289
classroom: a PhD student in Chinese medicine from BU, okay? So,

15
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.799
classroom: I think this is a very good way to introduce this course.

16
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.400
classroom: Because one thing we do in this course is to write about public policy.

17
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.380
classroom: And then try to publish in South China Morning Post.

18
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.539
classroom: Okay, so Sunshine Money Post has got a letter section.

19
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.049
classroom: letter to the editor, okay? Anyone can submit.

20
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.049
classroom: Anyone can submit a letter.

21
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.970
classroom: It's, you won't get paid.

22
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.330
classroom: Alright? But, if you, if the editor liked the letter, they will run it, they will publish it on paper, okay, as well as online.

23
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.200
classroom: So, the…

24
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:57.369
classroom: the word limit is up to 400 words, alright? Up to 400 words. But usually, these days, you see the whole section is kind of getting smaller, not enough space, so it's getting harder to publish letters there.

25
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:08.539
classroom: And, you know, when I first, offered this course, it was back in 20… 2019 or something?

26
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.269
classroom: I got at least 10 or more letters published every semester.

27
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.740
classroom: My students.

28
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.410
classroom: Okay? But these days, it's getting, getting more difficult, and also…

29
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:35.600
classroom: I don't always get the time to supervise and help students to pursue the project very rigorously, so we get less… fewer letters published these days. But still, we manage to publish at least 4 or 5 each semester.

30
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.770
classroom: Okay?

31
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.560
classroom: And, another thing is, the number of co-authors can be up to 3.

32
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.009
classroom: Okay? So,

33
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.220
classroom: But of course, if you form a group, let's say we have a group of 4 or 5,

34
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.760
classroom: Then you have to decide, you know, who is going to be the co-author.

35
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.700
classroom: Right? Or you can try to write two letters.

36
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.980
classroom: Alright.

37
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.610
classroom: So…

38
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:14.340
classroom: So that's the, that's the letter, which… which I think, it's… it's very relevant to your, to, expertise, right, to your specialty. That's why I want to bring this up.

39
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.930
classroom: Okay…

40
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.269
classroom: I have a QR code, so I have a Google Docs.

41
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.569
classroom: And I also, record today's session in case anyone who misses, the first week.

42
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.009
classroom: So, feel free to scan the QR code.

43
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.929
classroom: And, you should be able to have access to the Google Docs.

44
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.410
classroom: And, we also have a… WhatsApp group.

45
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.600
classroom: So, if you're not yet in the WhatsApp group, maybe you need to join.

46
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.389
classroom: You can check your email, or if you come to the Google Docs.

47
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.460
classroom: If you come to the Google Docs, the WhatsApp group link is right here, so you should be able to join.

48
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.080
classroom: Alright.

49
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:57.719
classroom: Yeah, so in Moodle, in Moodle, I also just recently, very recently updated the link, so you can, you can access the Google Docs link here as well.

50
00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.800
classroom: Okay.

51
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.210
classroom: Yeah, take your time and scan the QR code.

52
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.570
classroom: I only got one, one monitor here.

53
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.370
classroom: Alright, everybody on the same page?

54
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:46.780
classroom: So, I wonder if, anyone in this room who are not from Chinese medicine, or…

55
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.359
classroom: Raise your hand.

56
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.710
classroom: Wait, which major? What's your major?

57
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.300
classroom: Social work, okay.

58
00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.690
classroom: Social work, then your name is Lai Qi Yan? Okay.

59
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.250
classroom: Anyone else?

60
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.029
classroom: Everyone else… else is from Chinese medicine?

61
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.770
classroom: What's… what's your major?

62
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.310
classroom: And, what's your major?

63
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.390
classroom: Okay.

64
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.180
classroom: Okay. Okay.

65
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.470
classroom: Alright.

66
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:32.290
classroom: I think that's… that's very unusual, right? Because usually a G course like this would be, like, people from different backgrounds. But,

67
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.770
classroom: But I think that's actually good, because, as I said, number one.

68
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:47.299
classroom: I did something, you know? I also have connection with people from Chinese medicine. In fact, this student.

69
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.179
classroom: This student, Yu Ling Wang, She's a PhD student of Professor Pien.

70
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.859
classroom: Okay, yeah. So,

71
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:07.919
classroom: So, I have… I have a connection, you know? And I know another… I know, I know another, professor, I think his name is Lu.

72
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:14.289
classroom: Not Liu Yi Pin. I know Lui Pin too, yeah. I know Professor Liu, too.

73
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.720
classroom: But I'm talking about another Liu.

74
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.319
classroom: I forgot.

75
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:28.359
classroom: Anyway, so what I'm saying is that, actually, we can try to do something more related to Chinese medicine and healthcare in general.

76
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:37.739
classroom: Okay? And, if you search… in fact, one thing you can do is to search eHealth.

77
00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.560
classroom: Search eHouse and SDMP.

78
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.060
classroom: Go ahead and try to do that.

79
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:53.819
classroom: Because eHealth… is actually… a topic that I have done a lot of work on.

80
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.460
classroom: Do you know eHouse?

81
00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.959
classroom: the health record exchange… health record sharing system.

82
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:07.959
classroom: It was launched back in 2016, I believe.

83
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:15.269
classroom: I think… I started to pay attention to this

84
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.510
classroom: When, like, when it was first launched.

85
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.899
classroom: 20, 2016, or 28-2017?

86
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.390
classroom: Yeah, you see?

87
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.479
classroom: How Hong Kong can become a smart city in public health.

88
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:37.960
classroom: This was a letter, published in… 2018.

89
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.890
classroom: So it was published in March 2018, Which is…

90
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.879
classroom: Which is 2 years from it was launched.

91
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.810
classroom: Okay, 2016.

92
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:52.890
classroom: So, I already started doing research on this.

93
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.090
classroom: Back then.

94
00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:02.120
classroom: Alright? So, if you want to pursue a project on this, I think we can talk, we can discuss.

95
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.720
classroom: Alright.

96
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.759
classroom: Okay, so I do have some slides, but it's kind of a little bit dated.

97
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.390
classroom: So I want to, get started.

98
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.600
classroom: Alright, so… The course title is… Taking a stand.

99
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.729
classroom: Turning research insights into policy recommendation.

100
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.760
classroom: Now, taking a stand is very important.

101
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.970
classroom: That means we are going to make an argument.

102
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.830
classroom: Alright?

103
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.990
classroom: That means we're going to say something that the government may not like.

104
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:55.450
classroom: taking a stand, you see what I mean? So it's not like, oh, everything the government does is right, is good, it's very good, blah blah blah.

105
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:05.279
classroom: It's about… making an argument that the government needs to do more work. The government

106
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.550
classroom: Has room for improvement.

107
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.800
classroom: So… We are trying to turn research insights into policy recommendation.

108
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.839
classroom: In order to do that, we are going to do research in this course.

109
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.820
classroom: But our research won't be very rigorous. It's, not…

110
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:36.039
classroom: the kind of research that you have to go to the lab, you have to do a lot of, very systematic investigation, and publish a paper. We don't do that.

111
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.129
classroom: Our research is more practical.

112
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:46.409
classroom: Okay? I'm gonna explain to you our methodology. Our methodology is quite, quite different.

113
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.370
classroom: But I want you to do research.

114
00:11:49.260 --> 00:12:03.600
classroom: And hopefully we can gain some insights into how the government can do a better job. When we say the government needs to do a better job, that means we're going to critically review the government's practices and policy.

115
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.089
classroom: And to find that, actually, there's some room for improvement. There's something that they didn't do very well.

116
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:18.620
classroom: For example, back in 2016, 2018, when I am…

117
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:28.650
classroom: when I published this paper, this is not a paper, a letter, okay? How Hong Kong can become a smart city in public health.

118
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:35.630
classroom: At the time, There's only 680,000 people.

119
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.709
classroom: or enrolled in eHealth.

120
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:40.880
classroom: Right?

121
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:46.819
classroom: But this number… You don't get this number from the… from the internet.

122
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.910
classroom: Do you know how I got this number?

123
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.609
classroom: I emailed the government.

124
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.199
classroom: Okay? I write to the government.

125
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.319
classroom: And I asked them to provide a number. What is the…

126
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.740
classroom: Current number of people enrolled in the system.

127
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.350
classroom: And we got a number.

128
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:15.139
classroom: So that's actually one of the key methodologies of this course, is we approach the government department, government staff, and ask them questions.

129
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.829
classroom: And we got answer.

130
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:25.869
classroom: Do you know… you may wonder, how? How come the government will answer your question? Do you know why?

131
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.219
classroom: Have you heard of codon access to information?

132
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.040
classroom: Don't hide it yourself, Zelda.

133
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.799
classroom: Yeah, you heard of it.

134
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.730
classroom: Okay.

135
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:50.460
classroom: The PowerPoint is… Through… Here.

136
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.299
classroom: Some slides for week 1.

137
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:07.339
classroom: It's kind of a makeshift, because it's old slides. I feel sorry, because I tried to make some new slides, but it doesn't work, so I have to use the old slides.

138
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.929
classroom: Anyway… I'm still talking about the course title, right?

139
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.239
classroom: So, we do some research, And then we make a recommendation on how,

140
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:26.510
classroom: you know, the government can do a better job. In fact, This letter…

141
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.409
classroom: This letter that I published with a PhD student in Chinese medicine.

142
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:39.630
classroom: It's also following that pattern, right? So there's some research inside, but that research insight is not from my course, it's from her research team.

143
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.450
classroom: From Professor Bien's team.

144
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:48.620
classroom: So that's why, if you look at this… if you look at this letter, there's actually a little bit…

145
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.000
classroom: A little bit, information on the research.

146
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.499
classroom: Here, you see?

147
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:16.230
classroom: In a research project funded by the Jockey Club, Baptist University researchers developed a TCM body constitution questionnaire targeting the Kenyan-speaking elderly population. So there's a little bit of research, and then based on the research, we make some recommendation.

148
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.259
classroom: Alright? So that's what we do in this course.

149
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:33.020
classroom: So we have the WhatsApp group. If, you haven't joined the WhatsApp group, this is the QR code.

150
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.499
classroom: When you get a chance, you can do it now, or you can do it later, just…

151
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.230
classroom: Send a message.

152
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.199
classroom: To the group, but maybe most of you already know each other.

153
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.409
classroom: And, maybe you can send me a message, alright?

154
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:16.750
classroom: You know, usually I start engaged students, after the ad job period, right? Because, maybe I talk to them a little bit, and then they leave the course, so that's a bit embarrassing, so…

155
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:26.900
classroom: Okay, anyway, well, I, I used to have this, digital avatar, Which…

156
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.610
classroom: You know, it's… it's pretty… it's pretty fun, you know, to… to impress a freshman.

157
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:39.369
classroom: Or, you know, it… I think it's also… it can also… may work, may or may not work, it'll work, okay.

158
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.650
classroom: Let's see… Well, in fact.

159
00:16:45.160 --> 00:17:01.860
classroom: I don't know why it doesn't work here. So, actually, one of my colleagues is working with the Chinese medicine colleagues to build an avatar like this, not necessarily with my avatar, to train the students how to do the clinical handover.

160
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.089
classroom: Do you do clinical handover?

161
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:10.490
classroom: Okay. Anyway, so, so that's actually another project. I don't know why it doesn't work.

162
00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.540
classroom: Okay, never mind.

163
00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:19.649
classroom: Okay, so, oh, for AI.

164
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:29.249
classroom: We used to use the platform, but now we're going to switch to the HKBU. So one thing you might want to do, maybe later on during the course break.

165
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:36.950
classroom: Is to go to, our platform, the BU platform.

166
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.720
classroom: Maybe you can try and, log in?

167
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.850
classroom: Okay, so if you come to the,

168
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.530
classroom: Platform, and if you go to the bottom left.

169
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:36.900
classroom: you can see there's a profile and setting, right? So if you, open up the profile and setting, you see there's an API. So can anyone check and see if you have the API?

170
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:45.190
classroom: I don't know, I don't know if mobile devices would work, but on the computer, you can try and see if you have API. Now, if you have API,

171
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.030
classroom: Then you can, click on it.

172
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.709
classroom: And then you can generate a key.

173
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:59.140
classroom: But I just realized that Most freshmen, first-year students, they don't have API yet.

174
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.599
classroom: Soy, do you have… you don't?

175
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.960
classroom: No? Okay.

176
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.739
classroom: Well, then I have to talk to NGO.

177
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.020
classroom: Sorry. Nevermind.

178
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.809
classroom: We'll figure things out, no worry.

179
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.869
classroom: Okay, so let me, introduce the course. There's a couple of highlights.

180
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.950
classroom: The first thing I want to highlight is our methodology.

181
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:49.790
classroom: Okay? So we're going to do research in this course, but our research is not, like, in a lab, doing some very systematic collect data from the field.

182
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.790
classroom: You know, doing experiments.

183
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:57.400
classroom: Instead, our data… Comes from the government.

184
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:05.079
classroom: Okay? So, we write email, To the government staff, different department, different bureau.

185
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.389
classroom: And then… We cite code on access to information.

186
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.650
classroom: Okay? Because of this code.

187
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.939
classroom: The government staff are required to respond and give us a substantive reply in 3 weeks.

188
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.000
classroom: Okay?

189
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:35.369
classroom: So, if we, for example, today is, 4th of September, in 21 days, calendar days, okay, not working days, we will get a reply.

190
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:40.180
classroom: Usually, in substance, that means they will answer all your questions.

191
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.280
classroom: Yet.

192
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.769
classroom: Sometimes, it can be extended to 7 weeks.

193
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.980
classroom: Okay?

194
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:59.179
classroom: So if it's 7 weeks, you know, we only have 13 weeks in this semester, you see what I mean? So that means, to be safe, you probably want to send off the request around week 4.

195
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.630
classroom: Alright? Earlier, better.

196
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.620
classroom: Week 3 better, okay?

197
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.430
classroom: Now.

198
00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:16.479
classroom: Before we talk about the… well, actually, we already talked about the request of information, so maybe we can just finish this part.

199
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.769
classroom: A very short video, you can take a look.

200
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:24.950
classroom: But in this video, there's already… there's already some issues.

201
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:37.220
classroom: Which is very interesting. Yes. But we don't have to guess if it is transparent. You'd need no guesswork to get information from the government. The public can make requests for information under the Code on Access to Information.

202
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:55.250
classroom: Visit www.access.gov.hk to find out more.

203
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:02.369
classroom: Okay, since it's a very short video, I'm gonna play it again. Pay a bit more attention here, because,

204
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.309
classroom: There's some interesting… I'd have to guess if it is transparent.

205
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:13.940
classroom: You need no guesswork to get information from the government. The public can make requests for information under the Code on Access to Information.

206
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:31.930
classroom: Visit www.access.gov.hk to find out more.

207
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:41.970
classroom: Now, this video is actually an example An example of how…

208
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:47.030
classroom: The government may not be always so… Honest.

209
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.050
classroom: or transparent.

210
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:56.789
classroom: Because, think about this video. Of course, it's a 30-second video, right? You can only give that much information in 30 seconds.

211
00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:03.939
classroom: But I have to say, there's some very important and essential information that has been missing from this video.

212
00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.900
classroom: Okay? For example, time frame.

213
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.150
classroom: You see what I mean?

214
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.860
classroom: The timeframe of requesting information is 3 weeks.

215
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:21.209
classroom: Well, they will give you a 10 weeks, kind of interim reply, and then 3 weeks, and then 7 weeks. There's no information about that.

216
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.089
classroom: And also, you have the right to file a complaint.

217
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:31.699
classroom: You see what I mean? You have the right to request an internal review, and then file a complaint to ombudsman.

218
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.750
classroom: Not here.

219
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.989
classroom: You see what I mean? So they are actually offering information in a selective way.

220
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.490
classroom: They don't want to tell people the, the… The full picture.

221
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:48.410
classroom: Okay? So that's, that's the government, that's the nature of the government.

222
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.940
classroom: Now… This is a very interesting quote.

223
00:23:55.430 --> 00:24:02.989
classroom: In fact, I want to invite you to consider this quote. I'm going to ask you to… ask you to think about it, maybe invite you to talk a bit.

224
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.979
classroom: Have you heard of this quote before? Raise your hand if you read this quote before.

225
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.990
classroom: Government!

226
00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:20.100
classroom: Even in its best state, it's but a necessary evil, in its worst state, an intolerable one.

227
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:21.570
classroom: Okay.

228
00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.659
classroom: I think we're lucky, right? Our government is not in the…

229
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:33.379
classroom: in the worst state, we can still tolerate the government. But the point of this quote

230
00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:40.829
classroom: Is that even in its best form, best state, that means every government in the world

231
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:49.780
classroom: Right? Excluding those bad government, you know, intolerable ones. Even the best government is a necessary evil. What does it mean?

232
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:52.010
classroom: Think about it, what does it mean?

233
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.489
classroom: What do you think?

234
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.640
classroom: I would question…

235
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:18.680
classroom: What do you mean by evil? In what aspect? And to what extent do you consider it as an evil? Because this is quite subjective, actually.

236
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.090
classroom: Any guess?

237
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:27.659
classroom: Why do you think… is there any reason to consider government to be evil?

238
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:35.610
classroom: You know, there are two things you cannot avoid in life, right?

239
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.140
classroom: 1 and 2, do you know the two things?

240
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.900
classroom: Tex and death, right? Tex and death.

241
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:47.959
classroom: So the reason why people think the government is evil, It's because of taxation.

242
00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:57.630
classroom: Okay? Think about taxation. Basically, this… this government department take away part of your money What?

243
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.519
classroom: And if you don't pay, what's the consequence?

244
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.209
classroom: You go to jail!

245
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.090
classroom: If you don't pay tax, you go to jail. You see what I mean?

246
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.419
classroom: Is it that… is that evil?

247
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.350
classroom: I think it's pretty evil.

248
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:32.130
classroom: Okay? It's just as simple as that. You know, when any institution, or agents, or whatever, anyone tell you, you have to pay part of your money, part of your income, hard-earned income, to me, or you have to go to jail.

249
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:38.009
classroom: or whatever, you know, I'm gonna impose violence on you. Is that evil? Of course it's evil.

250
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.549
classroom: Think about it.

251
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:51.459
classroom: Can you say this is evil? Because, like, government is doing allocation of resources to different groups of people, so for some people, it may be evil, but for some people, it's good.

252
00:26:53.990 --> 00:27:08.539
classroom: Yes, you can say that, but I think when the label was applied to the government, say, the government of evil, we're not talking about a specific group of people, we're talking about the fact that you are able to take away innocent people's money

253
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.419
classroom: You know, out of duress.

254
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:17.279
classroom: That act in itself, is evil. You see what I mean?

255
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.969
classroom: So the whole idea… but see, the evil that the modifier is as necessary.

256
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.950
classroom: So it's kind of like a trade-off.

257
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:32.209
classroom: So we give up part of our freedom, part of our money, part of our wealth.

258
00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:38.390
classroom: For the government's protection, And… Services.

259
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.179
classroom: You see what I mean? You are here…

260
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:47.770
classroom: Because, of course, you pay the tuition, but then at the same time, the government also fund the institution.

261
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.859
classroom: Right? You're, you're paying, like, 40-something.

262
00:27:51.090 --> 00:28:01.009
classroom: 40K, right? Around 40K, 50K a year. But, if there are students who are not publicly funded, they have to pay, like, $100,000 or something.

263
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:10.179
classroom: So, it's necessary, because the government take away people's money, taxation, and then they're gonna fund the public goods.

264
00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.660
classroom: Alright? So, so, so this is the kind of trade-off we have to face.

265
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.240
classroom: And, and, you know, this is actually,

266
00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:32.319
classroom: the foundation, the intellectual foundation of democracy, right? So we start to… we begin to recognize that government is a necessary evil, and then what's the… what's the implication?

267
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.870
classroom: What is the implication?

268
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.509
classroom: The implication is that we have to hold the government accountable.

269
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.580
classroom: You see what I mean?

270
00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:48.900
classroom: Because these people, they got a lot of power, they got a lot of resources to do many things.

271
00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.089
classroom: They have… they make decisions that would have consequence on us.

272
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:58.460
classroom: as taxpayers, as the ordinary people. So, we have to hold them accountable.

273
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:07.980
classroom: The relationship between ordinary people and the government staff is essentially the relationship of the customers and the service providers.

274
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:09.819
classroom: You see what I mean?

275
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:13.150
classroom: So, so accountability is so important.

276
00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.859
classroom: How can you hold the government accountable?

277
00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:23.440
classroom: One way to ensure The government is accountable, it's transparency.

278
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:32.100
classroom: Right? Because you need to know what's going on. You have to know how the decision was made. What are the decisions being made?

279
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.859
classroom: Before you can hold them accountable, right?

280
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:50.159
classroom: So that's why we have the Code on Access Information. Code on Access Information is derived from Freedom of Information Law, which is something coming from the West. You know, in UK, US, in many European countries have the similar law.

281
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:58.240
classroom: And Hong Kong was following that example to set up the code on access to information. But it's the code, it's not the law.

282
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:05.960
classroom: But the idea that we need to hold the government accountable coming from the fact that we are the taxpayers.

283
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:16.679
classroom: Coming from the fact that we are the taxpayers, we are the customers, and the government is the service provider.

284
00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:23.929
classroom: Alright? So that's why we have the rights, we can email the government, and we can ask them questions.

285
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.450
classroom: Okay? So this is the foundation of our course.

286
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:37.020
classroom: We try to do things, we try to do research, and we find that actually the government is not doing a very good job in certain aspects.

287
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:45.280
classroom: Okay? And then, there's also another crucial element in the whole thing, Which is the free press.

288
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:55.780
classroom: Okay? So, there's the newspaper, there's the media, where people can Freely express our opinions.

289
00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.079
classroom: And that's why we have letters to the editor.

290
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.770
classroom: You see what I mean? We have letters to the editor.

291
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:12.600
classroom: And, this is a section that ordinary people like us can also write and express our opinions and share our views.

292
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:20.010
classroom: So… so all this coming together is… it becomes possible to run a course like this.

293
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.740
classroom: Okay? And we will be able to do some research, we'll be able to, investigate government's policy.

294
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.319
classroom: And we will find some loophole, find some room for improvement.

295
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.540
classroom: And then we're gonna write to the government again, and we're going to write to the lawmaker.

296
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:37.969
classroom: Okay, the Legislative Council.

297
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:47.710
classroom: Alright? To, Hopefully the lawmaker will be able to you know.

298
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.260
classroom: Not necessarily interven, but at least they know there's an issue here and there.

299
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.240
classroom: Alright.

300
00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:01.470
classroom: So, this is actually a very important point I want to… Why won't you make?

301
00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:08.829
classroom: But then at the same time, I don't want to, be too ambitious.

302
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:10.620
classroom: or idealistic.

303
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:21.050
classroom: Because… After so many years of writing letters, negotiating… negotiating with the government, or, you know,

304
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:26.550
classroom: Writing to the government, I don't think what I did make a big difference.

305
00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:33.570
classroom: You know? Maybe make some small difference, but not big difference. I can give you an example of a small difference.

306
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:47.460
classroom: Well, actually, I'm… even though it's a very small difference, I still feel like this is something that's worth talking about.

307
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.369
classroom: I've got this, case written.

308
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.590
classroom: You guys can read this later.

309
00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.150
classroom: So the, the…

310
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:07.450
classroom: The article is about how to write so the government will listen. And this is a very interesting case.

311
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:16.300
classroom: On a Saturday afternoon, Saturday afternoon, This is the bus stop.

312
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:22.969
classroom: in my home area, in my neighborhood. You can see The bus is full.

313
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.100
classroom: Okay?

314
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.610
classroom: Do you know why?

315
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.529
classroom: Because around 5PM, there's a lot of workers from a construction site.

316
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.189
classroom: They, they finish work. So they take this bus.

317
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:43.589
classroom: But the problem is, during Saturday afternoon, the frequency Is the holiday schedule.

318
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.850
classroom: So we're talking about 15 to 20 minutes.

319
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.210
classroom: You know?

320
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:54.449
classroom: And usually, I don't… I don't take this bus on Saturday afternoon, but somehow for that… that…

321
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.859
classroom: day, I took the bus, and I witnessed this.

322
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.230
classroom: So I emailed the transport department.

323
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:06.840
classroom: Okay? Because I said, you know, this is pretty urgent. You see what I mean?

324
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.560
classroom: And in one week, they didn't respond.

325
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:13.879
classroom: Okay? Do you know what I did?

326
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.689
classroom: I emailed the police.

327
00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:26.939
classroom: Okay? Because I tried to reframe the issue from a service of the transport of the bus to a security issue, or safety issue.

328
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.520
classroom: Okay? And when you email the police.

329
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.839
classroom: You see, this is… this many people.

330
00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:43.790
classroom: When you email the police, Now, the, the, the problem with…

331
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:50.759
classroom: The problem with contacting police is that most people don't know how to email police.

332
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.980
classroom: Do you know how to email police?

333
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.689
classroom: You only know how to call the police.

334
00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:03.999
classroom: Now, I'm going to give you the trick. Even… even you don't take the course, at least you will learn this, okay?

335
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:23.380
classroom: Okay, so, this is my trick. This is my trick. I always tell my students, after taking this course, even if you, don't learn anything, you learn how to complain.

336
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:28.610
classroom: Okay? You learn how to complain. And in Hong Kong, it's very important to learn how to complain, okay?

337
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:36.689
classroom: No. The government telephone directory is my, is my, secret weapon.

338
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.109
classroom: Because you can go here, alright?

339
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.400
classroom: Well, actually, my ultimate, weapon is this.

340
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.090
classroom: I will email the Office of Chief Executive.

341
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:53.460
classroom: Yeah. And when I emailed to the chief executive.

342
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:57.330
classroom: They will, usually, they will forward my email to a department.

343
00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:12.910
classroom: Or a bureau. And usually they will take it more seriously, okay? And, whenever I email the chief executive office, it's the… it's the secretary of the private secretaries

344
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.259
classroom: C, CEO of the… of Chief Executive.

345
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:22.750
classroom: So basically, between me and the chief sector, there are two people.

346
00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:31.369
classroom: Okay? Because the chief executive has a private sector, that's the very senior people, okay? Private sector. And then the private sector, you got the team member.

347
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.879
classroom: Is the team member email me? On behalf of the…

348
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.260
classroom: Private secretary, okay? So I can give you some example.

349
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:46.729
classroom: Anyway… Going back to, to, how to email police, okay?

350
00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.429
classroom: Police is actually one of the government departments, so you have to go here.

351
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:56.050
classroom: And then you will find… Hong Kong police.

352
00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:06.509
classroom: Again, even when you, contact the police, you, you need to be strategic, okay? You don't go… you don't go to the commissioner right away.

353
00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:14.079
classroom: You save commissioner for later, alright? So you go to, for example, in my case, it's in typo, right?

354
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.159
classroom: So I have to go down and find a…

355
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.550
classroom: Yeah, find a unit in charge of typo.

356
00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.930
classroom: But then when I emailed them, I would tell them, okay, you, you better send the officer.

357
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.509
classroom: To, to investigate. And then keep a record.

358
00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.900
classroom: Because the police, actually, there's an internal mechanism for handling complaints.

359
00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.590
classroom: Alright?

360
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:43.910
classroom: So that's how… We handle the government, basically.

361
00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.170
classroom: Alright.

362
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.159
classroom: So, the good news is.

363
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:54.539
classroom: The good news is, actually, I go to… I go to that bus stop every Saturday.

364
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.799
classroom: In, in 2 or 3 weeks to follow up.

365
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.330
classroom: And then you see the police was… the police officer was there.

366
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.049
classroom: Because I asked them to.

367
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.210
classroom: Okay?

368
00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:12.370
classroom: And, eventually, Eventually, they did increase.

369
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.590
classroom: the, frequency.

370
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:20.129
classroom: They increase the frequency. Because they also agreed there's a need to increase the frequency.

371
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:31.480
classroom: So my point is, with more knowledge about how the government works.

372
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.400
classroom: Including this kind of, like, directory or whatever.

373
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:41.880
classroom: you can actually make a small difference in our community. But if you want to make a bigger difference.

374
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:51.099
classroom: Then you need to, Maybe run, run for office, you know, I, I,

375
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.199
classroom: Oh, this is another, opportunity.

376
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.250
classroom: Do you know this, this lady?

377
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.789
classroom: She used to be a lawmaker, Mamai Gun.

378
00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:10.350
classroom: She used to be a lawmaker, now she's actually one of the… one of the… she's… she's one of the… yeah, she became a secretary later, yeah.

379
00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:20.389
classroom: So, so this is another thing we do. Maybe if you guys are interested, we can do that too. We can set up an appointment, a meeting with the lawmaker.

380
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:30.460
classroom: to, discuss issues. And this was a meeting we set up During the pandemic.

381
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.699
classroom: We are advocates for, corresponding children.

382
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:44.019
classroom: Because they have to stay in Shenzhen, they cannot come back to Hong Kong to go to their school, okay? So this was the…

383
00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:52.650
classroom: This was the… And this is a very interesting case, because after we met with Ms. Mack.

384
00:39:52.860 --> 00:40:00.770
classroom: she actually went to the Legislative Council meeting during the… when the chief executive was there.

385
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.809
classroom: So she was actually passed our message to…

386
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:08.519
classroom: to, Lamjan, okay, at the time.

387
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.060
classroom: So… and we also wrote a letter to the editor on this.

388
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:15.090
classroom: Okay?

389
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.989
classroom: So you can see Ms. Mac.

390
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.060
classroom: was…

391
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:39.089
classroom: So for now, a lot of the course boundary families are very concerned. We have, tens of thousands of cross-boundary students in the mainland, and they have to, attend, online classes in the mainland.

392
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:47.729
classroom: We have met some of the cross boundary parents, and they do have some recommendations. Like, in Shenzhen.

393
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:54.619
classroom: the, false boundaries. So, so she was actually honoring her promise?

394
00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.160
classroom: Right? Because, when we had the meeting, we explained the whole thing, so she, she followed up.

395
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:02.429
classroom: At the time, she was the lawmaker.

396
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:03.300
classroom: Alright.

397
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:15.599
classroom: And this is another, occasion. I was meeting with Wendy, Dr. Wendy Hong.

398
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:20.410
classroom: So, Wendy Hong is another lawmaker, and, we actually,

399
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:26.399
classroom: run this course in her office, okay, in the Legislative Council complex.

400
00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:40.590
classroom: I think we're going to set up something similar, this December, okay? So, we will invite all of you to the Legislative Council Complex to meet with the lawmaker and,

401
00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.650
classroom: To do the presentation.

402
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.040
classroom: Okay.

403
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.620
classroom: So that's… that's,

404
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:57.599
classroom: Again, I'm not saying that it would make a huge difference, but at least we have some channels to voice our opinions.

405
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.170
classroom: Which I think is important.

406
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:14.840
classroom: That's right, so this is a case of a real impact on practical issue, which I just talked about.

407
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:22.900
classroom: Now… when we write letters in SEMP,

408
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.740
classroom: Usually, it's… there's no response, but occasionally.

409
00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:35.250
classroom: the government will reply. They will also write a letter in the same column.

410
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.410
classroom: For example, this one.

411
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:45.529
classroom: This one, we talk about something pretty, unusual, it's called solar weather.

412
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.260
classroom: Okay, we talk about solar weather.

413
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:54.970
classroom: And then the, the… The observatory staff responded.

414
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.780
classroom: Okay.

415
00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:01.170
classroom: So that's like a public conversation with the government staff.

416
00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:02.300
classroom: Right?

417
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.680
classroom: And, there's,

418
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:19.180
classroom: There's a video here, we can watch a little bit, this is, the course got an award, got the teaching award a couple of years ago.

419
00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:38.480
classroom: DCAP3056 is an award-winning general education capstone course that Ben and I co-developed and co-teach for the Language Center and the Department of English. The course is designed to empower students

420
00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:58.539
classroom: to conduct research on policies and programs of the Hong Kong government, and then they share their insights by writing in the South China Morning Post Letters column. I help students to develop their research skills and to communicate their findings effectively in writing. I also help students in understanding the social issues and the role of the government's policies in addressing these social issues.

421
00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:16.099
classroom: I hope that I was able to open up some possible topic areas for student project work based on my own research interests in the LGBT plus community in Hong Kong and Asia. They were able to formulate a convincing argument on the need for better gender and sexuality inclusivity initiatives as a letter to the SCMP.

422
00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:27.300
classroom: We also collaborated on writing letters to the editor in the South China Morning Post as a way to demonstrate to our students the kind of writing and engagement with public discourse that we expect of in the course.

423
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:40.419
classroom: And actually having the opportunity to publish an article in a leading newspaper in Hong Kong is a real highlight of the course. Students find it rewarding to have their voices heard by the community through this publication.

424
00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:57.440
classroom: We also hope that students will develop the skills and confidence to engage in informed public de-schools and make a difference in their community. And we also hope that they'll actually be inspired to continue being active citizens and contribute to the public good long after the course is over.

425
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:05.410
classroom: Sustainable peace is mainly based on the emerging So,

426
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:13.659
classroom: But as I said, you know, in recent years, it's become more difficult to publish in the letter… in the letter section, and

427
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:22.780
classroom: I think, I think, we didn't do a very big project in, in recent years, so, so, hopefully this semester we can…

428
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.040
classroom: We can, pursue something,

429
00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:42.880
classroom: Alright, so very quickly, I will talk about the assessment, and then we will start exploring some topics. I don't think we're going to spend a whole full, full 3 hours today, you know, it's still the agile period, so…

430
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.870
classroom: And he just, relax.

431
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:52.090
classroom: Now, in terms of, assessment.

432
00:45:54.550 --> 00:46:00.790
classroom: It's, 35% is, individual work, and 65% will be good work.

433
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:05.629
classroom: So, I think, you know, working together is very important.

434
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:10.279
classroom: Essentially, we have an argumentative research paper to write.

435
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.960
classroom: For a group of around 5, students.

436
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.670
classroom: And, that's the main piece of work.

437
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:27.900
classroom: Usually, the word count is… we're talking about the 500 words per student, so that's the usual word count.

438
00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:34.299
classroom: And, hopefully we will be able to submit that to the Legislative Council.

439
00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:47.170
classroom: So it will be circulated among some panels, so the lawmakers can read, and they can at least become aware of this issue. And then the community engagement portfolio is also good work.

440
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:55.380
classroom: It would include the evidence of requesting information from the government, the evidence of writing for the public.

441
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.410
classroom: And also an infographic.

442
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:59.769
classroom: For making the argument.

443
00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:10.860
classroom: You can also make a video, but I don't think people would make a video, because infographic is less time-consuming. I mean, I would encourage you to try.

444
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:17.130
classroom: The refractive learning journal would be 35%.

445
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:31.349
classroom: you need to write about 5 entries, each about 200, 300 words. And everything you do here can be done with AI assistance. So, we're going to introduce the AI tools a little bit later.

446
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:41.039
classroom: Generally speaking, we got about 20-25% of the students will get an A-range grade.

447
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.000
classroom: Probably 70% would go to B range.

448
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:54.250
classroom: Usually students will get a C's because they don't do most of the work, or, you know, do not submit some of the work.

449
00:47:54.730 --> 00:48:00.019
classroom: Very few… I don't think anyone fail, unless they just don't come.

450
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.360
classroom: To class, or don't do anything.

451
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.199
classroom: So that's kind of the bottom line.

452
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.940
classroom: Other things, I think we're going to, negotiate, we're going to decide later.

453
00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:20.380
classroom: So, for now, I want to talk about the… the projects.

454
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:22.780
classroom: Okay?

455
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.540
classroom: So, in terms of the projects.

456
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:32.360
classroom: I have 5 projects or topics for you to choose.

457
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:39.780
classroom: And if you want to pursue a different project, you can form a team and talk to me.

458
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:46.639
classroom: But, I'm a little bit disinclined to supervise

459
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.370
classroom: project that I'm not familiar with.

460
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.020
classroom: Because that means more work.

461
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.109
classroom: to do.

462
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.110
classroom: Okay?

463
00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:05.220
classroom: So, the first project, I would encourage you to, consider… is… About the chatbot.

464
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:07.420
classroom: of Hong Kong Observatory.

465
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.309
classroom: And, the reason why,

466
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.829
classroom: I would encourage you to do that, it's because I have already done some work.

467
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:21.400
classroom: I requested information about the Dr. Teen chatbot.

468
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:28.950
classroom: About 3 years ago. But as you can see, it's 3 years ago. That means it's already outdated.

469
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:34.380
classroom: Right? Because nowadays we have large language model, we have general AI,

470
00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:39.199
classroom: And but you see, Observatory at the time already got the chatbot.

471
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:44.839
classroom: So the chatbot is not… it's nothing new, you see what I mean? But large language model is relatively new.

472
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:53.040
classroom: So anyone who wants to take up this project, I'll be very happy, and also you will be happy, because I've already done some work for you.

473
00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:56.820
classroom: Emergency alert system.

474
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.749
classroom: Emergency alert… do you know an emergency alert system?

475
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.950
classroom: It was used only once.

476
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.489
classroom: Since it was set up, But it costs 150 million Hong Kong dollars.

477
00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:17.900
classroom: 150 million Hong Kong dollars to build a system that was used only once since it was built.

478
00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:23.579
classroom: This is already a very problematic, project.

479
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.190
classroom: I did some work, and recently I was talking with a colleague.

480
00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.750
classroom: she said something quite interesting. She said, actually.

481
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.400
classroom: In the US, they have a similar system.

482
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.830
classroom: But they can send message to people in a specific region.

483
00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.400
classroom: Instead of everybody.

484
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:44.159
classroom: Cause right now, it sends to everybody.

485
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:52.149
classroom: So I think anyone who pick up this project, we're going to explore how the system can be of more use.

486
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.390
classroom: You see what I mean?

487
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:57.130
classroom: Because the money has already been spent.

488
00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:03.909
classroom: Right? So, so, so to be more positive, we want to see how,

489
00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:06.740
classroom: The system can be used in a more positive way.

490
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.760
classroom: And, another project is anti-scamming education, because a lot of

491
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.360
classroom: A lot of people get tricked, get scammed.

492
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:21.179
classroom: Alright, every year. A lot of… a lot of money being lost. So…

493
00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:29.919
classroom: we can look into it. I have some personal experience. I can't… I can't give you the details because of the confidential, you know, protect privacy, but…

494
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.860
classroom: It's pretty bad, okay? So, I think we want to look into that.

495
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:41.610
classroom: Number 4 is about… Port Health Division.

496
00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.519
classroom: Do you know Port Health's division?

497
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:49.339
classroom: So every time you go to the immigration department, you see some people from the Department of Health, right?

498
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.030
classroom: Remember?

499
00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.240
classroom: There's some Department of Health staff at the immigration department, at the immigration checkpoint.

500
00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:00.160
classroom: So that's the, poor health division.

501
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:06.549
classroom: Ice… I suspect these people are not really make a difference.

502
00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:10.640
classroom: So, I want to investigate. I want to know exactly what they do there.

503
00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:11.920
classroom: Okay.

504
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:21.909
classroom: And then there's another topic, it's about dementia, okay? About dementia risk for elderly. Again, this is a topic that I have already got some information from the government.

505
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:28.750
classroom: So, if you pursue that project, you don't start from zero, okay? You don't start from scratch, you have something to work on.

506
00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:38.459
classroom: And then, wildcard, if somebody wants to pursue your own project.

507
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:53.849
classroom: You need to talk to me, okay? We can… we can negotiate, we can decide. But I would expect, 60% or 70% of the students will be working on the existing project, working on these topics, because we are pretty sure this project

508
00:52:53.880 --> 00:53:00.490
classroom: If we work on it, we will be able to publish something, you know? This project, that's very promising.

509
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:10.240
classroom: But, if you… if you want to do something else, like Chinese medicine, or healthcare, e-health, you know, talk to me. We can… we can figure something out.

510
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:11.790
classroom: Okay?

511
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:32.970
classroom: So, let's take a short break, and then, for those of you who want to form the group today, we can form the group, and we can start talking about projects. Otherwise, yeah, so we can, we can see, you know, maybe we can pick up, next week. But, do, do take a break first.
