# Customized Chatbot Development - Sprint Plan

## Project Overview

Developing customized chatbots for an education course by revising existing system prompts and converting them to JSON format for platform deployment.

## Sprint 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Goals:** Establish project foundation and prepare materials

- [X] Review existing system prompt configurations from Bytewise repository
- [X] Load real bot configurations locally for analysis
- [X] Document platform specifications and JSON format requirements
- [X] Set up project structure and create comprehensive template

**Deliverables:**

- ‚úÖ Real bot configurations loaded from repository
- ‚úÖ Bytewise platform template and documentation
- ‚úÖ Project structure with botConfig directory

## Sprint 2: Educational Chatbot Creation (Week 2) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Goals:** Create a new educational chatbot configuration for the course

- [x] Define specific course requirements and learning objectives (GCAP3187)
- [x] Review draft system prompt for service-learning with elderly e-Sports
- [x] Convert system prompt to Bytewise JSON format with proper structure
- [x] Incorporate Socratic method and version tracking protocols
- [x] Finalize Emily chatbot configuration for elderly service-learning

**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ GCAP3187 course requirements analysis
- ‚úÖ Emily chatbot JSON configuration (`GCAP3187-emily.json`)
- ‚úÖ Socratic methodology and version tracking integration
- ‚úÖ Service-learning educational approach implementation

## Sprint 3: JSON Configuration & Platform Integration (Week 3) üîÑ IN PROGRESS

**Goals:** Finalize and validate the chatbot configuration

- [x] Convert system prompt to JSON using Bytewise template structure  
- [x] Configure bot metadata (Emily persona, emerald styling, GPT-4.1 model)
- [x] Set up teacher email notifications and detailed reporting
- [x] Add welcome prompts and comprehensive report generation instructions
- [ ] Validate JSON against platform requirements and test functionality
- [ ] Review and refine configuration based on educational standards

**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Complete Bytewise JSON configuration file (`GCAP3187-emily.json`)
- [ ] Platform integration validation checklist
- [ ] Educational effectiveness testing report

## Sprint 4: Deployment & Testing (Week 4)

**Goals:** Deploy chatbot to platform and validate functionality

- [ ] Deploy JSON configuration to Bytewise education platform
- [ ] Test chatbot functionality with real interactions
- [ ] Validate educational effectiveness and user experience
- [ ] Document deployment process and create user guides
- [ ] Gather feedback for future iterations

**Deliverables:**

- Deployed educational chatbot
- User testing results
- Platform deployment documentation
- User guide and training materials

## Sprint 5: Optimization & Simulation (Week 5) - Future Phase

**Goals:** Advanced testing and optimization (optional)

- [ ] Set up LLM-based student simulation system
- [ ] Run automated chatbot interaction tests
- [ ] Analyze conversation patterns and effectiveness
- [ ] Generate improvement recommendations
- [ ] Create automated testing framework

**Deliverables:**

- Simulation system setup
- Automated interaction results
- Performance analysis report
- Testing framework documentation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Educational Effectiveness:** Test with real scenarios and gather educator feedback
- **Platform Compatibility:** Use validated Bytewise JSON template structure
- **Technical Integration:** Early testing on platform environment
- **Timeline Delays:** Focus on core chatbot functionality first, simulation later

## Success Metrics

- Educational chatbot meets course learning objectives
- Successful deployment to Bytewise platform without issues
- Positive user feedback from educators and students
- Effective integration with existing course materials

## Current Status (September 13, 2025)

- ‚úÖ **Sprint 1 Complete**: Foundation established, real configs loaded
- üîÑ **Sprint 2 In Progress**: Creating educational chatbot system prompt
- ‚è≥ **Next**: JSON conversion and platform deployment
- üìã **Simulation**: Moved to future optional phase
