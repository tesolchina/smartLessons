Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Staff Directory for AO and EO Grades

To: enquiry@itib.gov.hk

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to make a formal request for information under the Code on Access to Information.

REQUEST DETAILS:
I would like to request access to the list of staff members in Administrative Officer (AO) and Executive Officer (EO) grades currently serving in Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, as contained in the government telephone directory https://tel.directory.gov.hk/index_ENG.html or equivalent internal staff directory.

SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUESTED:
- Names of staff members holding AO grades (AO, SAO, PAO, etc.)
- Names of staff members holding EO grades (EO, SEO, CEO, etc.)
- Their respective job titles and positions
- The divisions or sections they are assigned to within your department/bureau

PURPOSE AND RESEARCH CONTEXT:
My intention in requesting this information is to conduct academic research on how staff from the Administrative Officer and Executive Officer grades are distributed and serve across different government departments and bureaus. As a policy bureau, your organization likely employs AO and EO grade officers in various policy development and coordination roles, making this information valuable for understanding administrative structures in policy formulation.

This research aims to analyze deployment patterns, career progression paths, and organizational structures of these key civil service grades within the Hong Kong government system. The findings will contribute to academic understanding of public administration and civil service management in Hong Kong.

LEGAL BASIS:
This request is made under the Code on Access to Information, which provides for public access to government information unless there are specific exemptions that apply. I believe the requested information relates to the general administration and organization of government departments and should be available for public access.

FORMAT PREFERENCE:
I would be grateful if the information could be provided in electronic format (Excel spreadsheet, PDF, or similar) for easier reference and analysis.

I understand that you will acknowledge receipt of this request within 10 days and provide a substantive response within 21 days, as per the Code on Access to Information guidelines. If you require any clarification regarding this request or if there are any processing fees involved, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,
