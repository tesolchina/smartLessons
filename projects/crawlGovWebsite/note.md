**DRAFT EMAIL TEMPLATE**

**Subject:** Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Staff Directory for AO and EO Grades

Dear Access to Information Officer,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to make a formal request for information under the Code on Access to Information.

**Request Details:**
I would like to request access to the list of staff members in Administrative Officer (AO) and Executive Officer (EO) grades currently serving in your department/bureau, as contained in the government telephone directory or equivalent internal staff directory.

**Specific Information Requested:**

- Names of staff members holding AO grades (AO, SAO, PAO, etc.)
- Names of staff members holding EO grades (EO, SEO, CEO, etc.)
- Their respective job titles and positions
- The divisions or sections they are assigned to within your department/bureau

**Purpose and Intention:**
My intention in requesting this information is to conduct research and gain a better understanding of how staff from the Administrative Officer and Executive Officer grades are distributed and serve across different government departments and bureaus. This information will help me analyze the deployment patterns and organizational structure of these key civil service grades within the Hong Kong government system.

**Legal Basis:**
This request is made under the Code on Access to Information, which provides for public access to government information unless there are specific exemptions that apply. I believe the requested information relates to the general administration and organization of government departments and should be available for public access.

**Format Preference:**
I would be grateful if the information could be provided in electronic format (Excel spreadsheet, PDF, or similar) for easier reference and analysis.

I understand that you will acknowledge receipt of this request within 10 days and provide a substantive response within 21 days, as per the Code on Access to Information guidelines.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,
