this is actually the first time we offer this course 
so do not mention past students 
also I need an html version so I can copy over to outlook 


Please draft an email as the co-teacher Simon to 
- acknowledge Saul's concern 
- emphasize that programming in python is a tool for data visualization and possibly data retrieval through API 
- we do not expect students to master such skills but need to learn to communicate with AI to do programming 
- we'll support you as we did last week 
- you should be able to perform well without programming exp 
- hope this addresses your concern 
- do let us know if you have more questions 

Cheers
Simon

Subject: Course Expectations and Support for Students Without Programming Experience
 
Dear Dr. Talia Wu,
I hope this email finds you well. I am Saul Ma, a year 3 BBA Marketing student. I am currently enrolled in your GCAP3226 - Empowering Citizens Through Data: Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong class. As someone with no prior programming experience, I wanted to ask whether the assignments and group projects are more focused on developing programming skills or on analytical thinking and interpretation.
I am concerned about keeping up with the course requirements and achieving a good grade, given my background. Will there be support or instruction for students who are new to programming, and will the course cover the necessary data analysis skills?
Thank you very much for your guidance.
Best Regards, 
Saul Ma
