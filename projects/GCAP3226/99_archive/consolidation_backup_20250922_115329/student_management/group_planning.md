# Group Planning & Size Calculations

*Generated: September 6, 2025*

## ðŸ“Š Current Situation

### Enrollment Numbers
- **Current Enrollment**: 38+ students
- **Expected Final**: 40-42 students (accounting for late enrollments)
- **Group Size Target**: 4-5 students per group

### Group Mathematics

#### Option 1: 4 Students Per Group
- 40 students Ã· 4 = **10 groups**
- 42 students Ã· 4 = **10.5 groups** (need 11 groups, one with 2 students)

#### Option 2: 5 Students Per Group  
- 40 students Ã· 5 = **8 groups**
- 42 students Ã· 5 = **8.4 groups** (need 9 groups, some with 4 students)

#### Option 3: Mixed Size Groups (RECOMMENDED)
- **8 groups of 5 students** = 40 students
- **2 groups of 4 students** = 8 students
- **Total**: 10 groups, 48 student capacity

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Group Structure

### Final Decision: 10 Mixed Groups
```
Group 01: 5 students - Project A
Group 02: 5 students - Project B  
Group 03: 5 students - Project C
Group 04: 5 students - Project D
Group 05: 5 students - Project E
Group 06: 4 students - Project F
Group 07: 4 students - Project G
Group 08: 4 students - Project H
Group 09: 4 students - Project I
Group 10: 4 students - Project J
```

**Total Capacity**: 46 students  
**Buffer**: 4-6 student buffer for late enrollments

## ðŸ“‹ Project Assignment Strategy

### 10 Required Project Topics
Need to develop projects that can accommodate both 4 and 5 person groups:

1. **Housing Policy Analysis** (Complex - 5 students)
2. **Transportation Data Study** (Complex - 5 students)
3. **Education Resource Allocation** (Complex - 5 students)
4. **Environmental Impact Assessment** (Complex - 5 students)
5. **Healthcare Access Analysis** (Complex - 5 students)
6. **Social Services Efficiency** (Moderate - 4 students)
7. **Digital Government Services** (Moderate - 4 students)
8. **Youth Employment Programs** (Moderate - 4 students)
9. **Elderly Care Policy** (Moderate - 4 students)  
10. **Community Development Initiatives** (Moderate - 4 students)

### Complexity Matching
- **5-student groups**: More complex projects requiring additional research depth
- **4-student groups**: Focused projects with clear scope boundaries

## ðŸ”„ Group Formation Process

### Step 1: Data Collection (Week 1)
- [ ] Deploy Gmail collection form
- [ ] Collect project topic preferences  
- [ ] Note any special requirements/constraints

### Step 2: Initial Assignment (Week 2)
- [ ] Create preliminary groups based on preferences
- [ ] Balance group sizes (aim for 10 groups total)
- [ ] Consider student schedule compatibility if provided

### Step 3: Adjustment Period (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Allow 2-3 days for group change requests
- [ ] Handle special circumstances (schedule conflicts, etc.)
- [ ] Finalize groups by end of Week 3

### Step 4: Project Matching (Week 3)
- [ ] Assign projects based on group preferences
- [ ] Ensure complex projects go to 5-student groups
- [ ] Provide backup project options for each group

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Success Metrics

### Group Balance Targets
- **Optimal**: All groups have 4-5 members
- **Acceptable**: No group smaller than 3, none larger than 6
- **Project Distribution**: Even spread across complexity levels

### Engagement Metrics
- **Response Rate**: >90% form completion
- **Satisfaction**: <5% group change requests after initial assignment
- **Retention**: <2% student withdrawals after group formation

## ðŸš¨ Contingency Plans

### Too Many Students (>46)
- Create 11th group
- Split largest project into two related sub-projects
- Consider 6-person groups for collaborative projects

### Too Few Students (<35)
- Reduce to 8-9 groups
- Combine related project topics
- Maintain minimum group size of 4

### Uneven Distribution
- Use project complexity as balancing factor
- Offer bonus points for joining smaller groups
- Instructor assignment as last resort

*This plan provides flexibility while ensuring all students have appropriate group sizes and project assignments.*
