## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that regression techniques provide a powerful, unified framework for evidence-based policymaking across diverse domains. The consistent patterns identified across seven different policy areas suggest that:

1. **Statistical relationships in public policy** follow predictable patterns that can be modeled and optimized
2. **Cross-topic learning** is possible and valuable, with methods and insights transferable between domains
3. **Integrated approaches** that consider multiple outcome dimensions simultaneously produce better results than single-focus optimization
4. **Real-time, adaptive management** based on regression analysis can significantly improve policy effectiveness

The future of Hong Kong public policy lies in embracing these analytical approaches to create more effective, efficient, and responsive governance that serves citizens better through evidence-based decision-making.

**Key Success Factors:**
- Invest in data infrastructure and analytical capacity
- Develop cross-functional teams combining domain expertise with statistical skills
- Implement systematic, regression-based policy evaluation protocols
- Foster a culture of evidence-based decision-making across government

By applying these lessons systematically across all policy domains, Hong Kong can become a global leader in data-driven governance that optimizes outcomes for citizens while maximizing the effective use of public resources.
