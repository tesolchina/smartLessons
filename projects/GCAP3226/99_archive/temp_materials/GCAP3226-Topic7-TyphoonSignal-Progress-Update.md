# GCAP3226 - Topic 7: Typhoon Signal Accuracy Analysis

## üìä Project Overview
**Research Focus**: Analysis of Hong Kong Observatory's typhoon Signal No. 8 decisions by comparing real-time wind measurement data from 30 weather stations with official signal criteria.

**Key Research Question**: How accurately do typhoon signal decisions reflect actual wind conditions, particularly regarding the early announcement of Signal No. 8 maintenance until 11:00 AM on September 9, 2025?

## üìã **Key Research Findings**

### **September 8-9, 2025 Signal No. 8 Event**:
- **Early Announcement**: Unusually early commitment to maintain Signal No. 8 until 11:00 AM
- **Wind Data Analysis**: Frequent periods where measurements didn't meet Signal No. 8 criteria
- **Signal Criteria**: Official requirement is ‚â•50% of 8 reference stations recording 63-117 km/h winds
- **Data Discrepancy**: Public API data suggested periods of non-compliance with criteria

### **Research Concerns Identified**:
1. **Decision Timing**: Earlier than usual announcement of signal maintenance duration
2. **Criteria Compliance**: Gaps between actual wind measurements and signal requirements
3. **Public Impact**: Effect on transportation, schools, and business operations
4. **Transparency**: Need for public access to decision-making data

## üìß **Information Request Status**

### **HKO Data Request Prepared**:
- **Recipient**: dsec@hko.gov.hk (HKO Data Services)
- **Legal Framework**: Code on Access to Information Ordinance
- **Request Type**: Academic research for public interest
- **Data Needed**: Official wind measurements, decision documentation, reference station data

### **Specific Information Requested**:
1. Raw 10-minute wind data from 8 reference anemometer stations
2. Internal meteorological assessments for Signal No. 8 timing
3. Documentation of early maintenance announcement decision
4. Quality control and validation records for September 8-9, 2025
