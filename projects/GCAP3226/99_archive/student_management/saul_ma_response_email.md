Dear Saul,

Thank you for reaching out with your concerns about GCAP3226. I really appreciate your proactive approach in seeking clarification about the course requirements.

I want to reassure you that **programming in Python is primarily a tool** for data visualization and possibly data retrieval through APIs in our course. We absolutely **do not expect students to master programming skills** from scratch. Instead, our focus is on helping you learn how to **communicate effectively with AI to accomplish programming tasks** - which is actually a much more valuable 21st-century skill.

Based on what we observed in Week 1, you and your classmates demonstrated excellent ability to work with AI tools to achieve the technical outcomes we needed. The key is learning how to:
- Clearly articulate what you want to accomplish with data
- Guide AI assistants to help you create visualizations
- Interpret and analyze the results meaningfully

**We will continue to provide the same level of support we offered last week.** Our teaching approach is designed specifically for students from diverse academic backgrounds, including those without any programming experience. The course assignments and group projects are much more focused on:
- **Analytical thinking and interpretation**
- **Understanding policy implications of data**
- **Communicating insights effectively**
- **Collaborative problem-solving**

You should be able to perform well in this course without prior programming experience. Your background in marketing actually brings valuable analytical and critical thinking skills that are perfectly suited for this course.

I hope this addresses your concerns. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions as we progress through the semester. Both Dr. Wu and I are committed to supporting all students in achieving success in this course.

Looking forward to seeing your continued engagement in class!

Cheers,  
Simon
