Criteria for Increasing Bus Frequency
“For individual bus routes, if the passenger load factor reaches 90% during the busiest half-hour and 75% during the busiest hour of peak periods, or 60% during the busiest hour of off-peak periods, the department and the franchised bus company will consider increasing the service frequency.”

Questions
The passenger load factor of City Bus No. 56, as reported in the proposal, is 32% during the busiest hour (before adjustment). However, it is unclear:

How this passenger load factor is defined
When the busiest hour occurs
Whether the 32% represents an average across different stops and shifts
How an increase in bus frequency is justified given a passenger load factor of 32%

Objectives
To develop and analyze a simulation of Bus Route 56 operations during the morning using field data and estimated arrival times (ETA) from https://data.gov.hk/en/.
To assess the justification for route and frequency adjustments to Bus No.56 by estimating the seat utilization rate via simulation.
To provide evidence-based policy recommendations.

Key processes
To calculate the seat utilization rate, we need to count the passengers on bus at each stop. 

The bus stops at every station; the travel time between each pair of stops is random.
At each stop, the number of waiting passengers is random.
At each stop, the number of passengers getting off is random.

=== SLIDE 10 ===
Travel time
The bus travel time between each pair of stops is modelled as a random variable drawn from a normal distribution, with the mean and standard deviation estimated from sample data.
Using the API, we collected ETA at each stop for 30 trips of Bus No. 56.
We then calculated the mean and standard deviation of travel times between each pair of stops. For each simulation run, we sampled travel times from the corresponding normal distributions to represent the bus travel times between stops.

Number of waiting passengers
The number of waiting passengers at each stop is modelled as a random variable drawn from a Poisson distribution.

=== SLIDE 12 ===
Number of passengers getting off
The number of passengers getting off at each stop is modelled as a random variable drawn from a Binomial distribution.

SimPy
13
1. Initialization: Global variables are reset for each simulation run​
2. Environment Creation: A new SimPy environment is created​
3. Process Scheduling: Multiple bus processes are scheduled with different departure times​
4. Concurrent Execution: All bus processes run concurrently, each following their route​
5. Event-Driven Progression: Each bus process yields control during travel times, allowing other buses to operate​
6. Data Collection: Each process records utilization data as it progresses​
7. Simulation End: Runs until all buses complete their journeys

Result – forward, before adjustment

In 1000 simulation:
Median of seat utilization: 
18% - 56%, based on estimated passenger flow at the removed bus stops.

Result – return, before adjustment

In 1000 simulation:
Median of seat utilization: 
8% - 58%

--------------------------------------------------
=== SLIDE 18 ===
Result - Summary
The adjustment appears to have reduced overall seat utilization rate. 
The decision to increase bus frequency should also be analysed from the perspective of operating costs.

Enquiry to Department of Transportation
1.	Operational and Passenger Flow Data:
What types of operational and passenger flow data (e.g., stop-level boarding and alighting, peak/off-peak passenger counts) were collected and analyzed when assessing the rerouting and schedule changes for Routes 56 and 56A?
2.	Service Quality Evaluation:
What quantitative models or criteria (such as load factor thresholds, predicted waiting times, or cost-benefit analyses) were used to evaluate whether the service modifications would maintain or improve passenger service quality?
3. 	Data Accessibility:
Are the relevant operational datasets, consultation summaries, or evaluation models available for public or academic review? If so, how can these be accessed? If not, would the Transport Department consider releasing anonymized or summarized data in accordance with the Code on Access to Information?
