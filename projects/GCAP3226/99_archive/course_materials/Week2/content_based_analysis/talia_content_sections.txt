TALIA'S CONTENT SECTIONS
==================================================

Based on content analysis, these sections should be attributed to Talia:

CHUNK 1:
**PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTION:** SIMON_WANG

**CONTENT_BREAKDOWN:**
- 100% Simon Wang content
- 0% Talia content

**KEY_INDICATORS:**
Simon Wang indicators:
- Course administration ("first two weeks", "Zoom recording")
- Direct references to course code ("GCAP 3226")
- Discussion of course structure and roadmap
- References to Moodle and course materials
- Discussion of group formation and assessment
- Use of instructor-style language ("we're here to help you")
- References to "this course" and "first time we run this course"
- Discussion of course logistics and technical setup

**QUESTIONNAIRE_RELEVANCE:** NONE
- No discussion of survey methodology or questionnaire design
- Content is purely focused on course administration and setup

**RECOMMENDED_SPEAKER_TRANSITIONS:**
No transitions needed - this should be a continuous segment by Simon Wang as it's entirely focused on course administration and setup.

**CONFIDENCE_LEVEL:** HIGH

Reasoning:
- The content is exclusively focused on course administration, logistics, and setup
- The speaking style is clearly that of the main instructor
- Multiple references to course structure and teaching approach
- Discussion of course materials and learning management system
- Mentions of this being the first time running the course
- Instructor-style reassurances about difficulty level and support
- No content that aligns with Talia's expertise in questionnaire methodology

This is unambiguously content that should be delivered by the main course instructor (Simon Wang) rather than a guest speaker on questionnaire methodology.
----------------------------------------

CHUNK 2:
**PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTION:** MIXED

**CONTENT_BREAKDOWN:**
- Talia: ~70% (First half discussing questionnaire methodology and survey design)
- Simon Wang: ~30% (Administrative interruption and course logistics)

**KEY_INDICATORS:**
Talia's sections:
- Detailed explanation of survey question design
- Analysis of attitude measurement methodology
- Discussion of policy perception questions
- Technical explanation of ordinal scales
- Academic research methodology

Simon Wang's sections:
- "Sorry to interrupt..."
- References to "our Week 2 notes in Moodle"
- Course logistics about accessing materials
- Explanation of course objectives ("today we're going to teach you...")
- References to students joining late

**QUESTIONNAIRE_RELEVANCE:** HIGH
The majority of the content directly discusses questionnaire design and methodology

**RECOMMENDED_SPEAKER_TRANSITIONS:**
1. Clear transition at "Sorry to interrupt..." - switches from Talia to Simon
2. Brief reference to "Dr. Wu" (Talia) during Simon's section
3. Returns to Talia at "Okay. So later in the CSV file..."

**CONFIDENCE_LEVEL:** HIGH
The content shows clear distinctions between:
- Talia's academic presentation of survey methodology
- Simon's administrative and instructional interruption
- The transitions are natural and clearly marked by changes in topic and presentation style

The chunk demonstrates a natural flow between speakers, with Talia providing the technical content and Simon handling class management and context-setting for students who joined late.

CHUNK 3:
**PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTION:** SIMON_WANG

**CONTENT_BREAKDOWN:**
- 100% Simon Wang content
- 0% Talia content

**KEY_INDICATORS:**
Simon Wang indicators:
- Technical setup instructions for VS Code and Python
- Course administration ("starting from next week...")
- Direct teaching style ("For today, we will use...")
- References to course materials and setup ("reference book, which I screenshot yesterday")
- Discussion of programming tools and interfaces
- Mentions of future course organization ("I'm going to set up a WhatsApp group")

**QUESTIONNAIRE_RELEVANCE:** LOW
- Only brief mention of questionnaire at the beginning as context for data visualization exercise
- Focus is primarily on technical setup and programming environment

**RECOMMENDED_SPEAKER_TRANSITIONS:**
No transitions needed - this should be entirely Simon Wang's section as it focuses on:
1. Technical setup instructions
2. Course logistics
3. Programming environment introduction
4. Basic software interface explanation

**CONFIDENCE_LEVEL:** HIGH

Reasoning:
- Content is heavily focused on technical setup and course administration
- Teaching style is instructional and focused on practical implementation
- No detailed discussion of questionnaire methodology or survey research
- Clear instructor voice discussing course logistics and technical requirements
- Multiple references to course organization and future plans
- Focus on programming tools and environment setup rather than research methodology

This chunk shows clear characteristics of being an instructor-led technical setup section, making it firmly Simon Wang's content rather than Talia's research-focused material.
----------------------------------------

CHUNK 4:
**PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTION:** SIMON_WANG

**CONTENT_BREAKDOWN:**
- 100% Simon Wang content
- 0% Talia content

**KEY_INDICATORS:**
Simon Wang indicators:
- Technical instruction about software setup (VS Code, GitHub Copilot)
- Direct teaching style with classroom management ("raise your hand")
- References to helping students ("we'll help you")
- Technical terminology and explanations (extensions, command line, terminal)
- Classroom interaction ("computer science majors, do you want to stand up")
- Reassuring teaching tone ("that's normal, okay? Don't worry")

**QUESTIONNAIRE_RELEVANCE:** LOW
- Only brief mention of questionnaire data ("CSV... all the data we got from the questionnaire") but not discussing methodology

**RECOMMENDED_SPEAKER_TRANSITIONS:**
No transitions needed - this is clearly a technical instruction segment that should be delivered entirely by the main instructor

**CONFIDENCE_LEVEL:** HIGH

Reasoning:
- The entire chunk focuses on technical setup and classroom instruction
- Uses direct teaching style characteristic of a main instructor
- Contains classroom management elements
- Explains technical tools and software
- Shows ongoing relationship with students (not guest speaker style)
- References to previous content ("Dr. Wu just presented") suggesting this is the main instructor following up
- Teaching style is informal and supportive, characteristic of regular instructor rather than guest presenter

This content is clearly meant for the main instructor (Simon Wang) as it deals with technical setup, classroom management, and course logistics rather than questionnaire methodology or research content that would be Talia's expertise.
