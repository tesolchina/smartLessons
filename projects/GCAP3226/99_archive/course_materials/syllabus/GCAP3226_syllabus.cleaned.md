## Aims & Objectives
In this course, the central focus is on enhancing students' understanding and application of data-informed public policymaking within the Hong Kong context. The objective is to equip students with the analytical tools and interdisciplinary approaches necessary to assess and influence policy decisions effectively. By integrating quantitative analysis with qualitative insights, the course aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of how data-driven strategies can be employed to address complex social issues, aligning with specific targets of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Students will evaluate how much Hong Kong's government uses data in policymaking, focusing on transparency, accountability, and effectiveness. Through practical projects and case studies, they will explore the impact of data-informed decisions in areas such as public transportation, health, and environmental management. A significant component of the course includes opportunities for students to request data from the Hong Kong government and engage directly with lawmakers (LegCo members) and district council members. This experiential learning approach enables students to gain firsthand insights and practical experience in the policymaking process.

Ultimately, the course prepares students to become active agents of change in society. They will gain the competencies needed to navigate and influence the complex landscape of global sustainability challenges, equipped with the tools to implement and advocate for policy changes that contribute to the SDGs. This holistic approach not only enhances their analytical and expressive capabilities but also instills a commitment to lifelong learning and civic engagement in a globalized world.

## Course Intended Learning Outcomes (CILOs)

| CILO | By the end of the course, students should be able to: | PILO Alignment |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | Apply case study methods to evaluate data governance practices in specific public policies and demonstrate how improved data collection and transparency can enhance decision-making in Hong Kong. | 2,3 |
| 2 | Critically review the data governance policies and practices of the Hong Kong government through identifying missing data that should have enhanced decision-making. | 3,5 |
| 3 | Effectively communicate findings through visual presentations and narratives tailored for stakeholders including the Hong Kong SAR government, NGOs, and the public. | 4,5 |
| 4 | Utilize AI tools comprehensively to support the achievement of the aforementioned CILOs by assisting in data analysis, model building, coding, and the development of engaging narratives and presentations. | 5 |

## Teaching & Learning Activities (TLAs)

### Lectures on Public Policy Foundations (CILO 1)
Initial lectures will provide students with essential background knowledge necessary for understanding the public policy landscape in Hong Kong. Topics covered will include the role and structure of the Hong Kong government, the standard procedures in public policymaking, and the relationship between public policy and legislation. Co-taught sessions where the Mathematics teacher introduces data-driven governance and the Language teacher discusses communication strategies.

### Policy Analysis Workshops (CILOs 1,2,3)
These workshops will demonstrate the application of data-informed approaches in policymaking through practical examples. Common data visualization and analysis techniques that are useful in public policymaking will be introduced. Students will analyze case studies involving the decision-making processes for areas such as public transportation efficiency, solid waste management planning, and public health promotion strategies. These sessions aim to show how data supports effective policy decisions. Both teachers lead workshops to integrate data analysis techniques with critical evaluation and communication strategies.

### Experiential Learning Projects (CILOs 2,3,4)
In these projects, students will delve into the practical aspects of public policy by selecting a relevant topic, formulating research questions, and conducting field research within the community to gather essential data and insights. The objective is to apply classroom knowledge in real-world settings, enhancing their understanding through active engagement. To facilitate collaborative brainstorming, project planning, and execution, teams will use digital platforms such as Miro for visual collaboration and Google Workspace for document sharing, task management, and real-time updates. These tools will simulate real-world digital teamwork environments often required in professional policymaking.

Key features of this TLA include opportunities for students to meet and interact with Legislative Council (Legco) lawmakers, district council members, and community leaders, where they can present their findings and discuss their ideas. These interactions are designed to extend the impact of their research by circulating their reports among these key stakeholders, thus directly contributing to policy discourse and development.

Upon completion of the field research, students will return to the classroom to analyze their data using the techniques previously learned. They will prepare comprehensive reports and presentations to share their insights with peers, synthesizing their field experiences with academic research to offer well-rounded perspectives on public policy challenges and solutions.

Both teachers collaborate to guide students in applying data analysis and communication skills during fieldwork and report preparation.

(Note: meetings with lawmakers will be arranged subject to the availability of the Legco members and other factors; alternatively, students to submit their written reports to the Legislative Council in lieu of face-to-face meetings).

### Computer based practice (CILOs 1,2)
Students will learn to implement data visualization techniques and commonly used analytical models by using computer software.

### AI-Enhanced Storytelling Sessions (CILOs 1,2,3,4)
In these workshops, students will learn how to integrate AI tools across various aspects of their coursework, enhancing their ability to analyze data, build models, and craft compelling narratives. Additionally, students will use platforms like Miro to collaboratively develop storyboarding and conceptual frameworks for their presentations, and Google Slides to create engaging visual narratives. These tools will enhance teamwork and ensure that storytelling is not only data-driven but also visually impactful and polished.

Students will engage in practical exercises that demonstrate the application of AI in public policy analysis, from data visualization to predictive modeling. These skills are crucial for enhancing their research and presentations, making them more effective and impactful for diverse audiences including policymakers, NGOs, and the general public. Additionally, the workshops will provide students with opportunities to interact directly with key stakeholders such as Legislative Council members and NGO managers. These interactions will allow students to apply their newly acquired AI skills in real-world contexts, receiving constructive feedback that will further refine their techniques and approaches.

Co-taught sessions where the Language teacher introduces AI-driven storytelling tools, and the Mathematics teacher integrates these tools with quantitative analysis.
