Aims & Objectives 
  
In this course, the central focus is on enhancing students' understanding and application of data-
informed public policymaking within the Hong Kong context. The objective is to equip students 
with the analytical tools and interdisciplinary approaches necessary to assess and influence policy 
decisions effectively. By integrating quantitative analysis with qualitative insights, the course aims 
to foster a comprehensive understanding of how data-driven strategies can be employed to address 
complex social issues, aligning with specific targets of the United Nations' Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).  
 
Students will evaluate how much Hong Kongâ€™s government uses data in policymaking, focusing 
on transparency, accountability, and effectiveness. Through practical projects and case studies, 
they will explore the impact of data-informed decisions in areas such as public transportation, 
health, and environmental management. A significant component of the course includes 
opportunities for students to request data from the Hong Kong government and engage directly 
with lawmakers (LegCo members) and district council members. This experiential learning 
approach enables students to gain firsthand insights and practical experience in the policymaking 
process.  
 
Ultimately, the course prepares students to become active agents of change in society. They will
