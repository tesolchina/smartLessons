# Typhoon Signal Project

## Overview
The HKO made an early announcement on when to hoist no 8 signal and commit to keeping it until 11am at least. We use the API to review the wind strength data from 30 stations and found that most of the time the data indicate not meeting the criteria for no 8.

## Status
- API access established
- Initial analysis completed on 30 weather stations
- Data shows discrepancy with signal criteria

## Research Questions
- How accurate are typhoon signal decisions based on actual wind data?
- What factors influence signal timing decisions?
- How can signal accuracy be improved?

## Data Sources
- HKO weather station API (30 stations)
- Typhoon signal announcement data
- Wind strength measurements
- Signal criteria documentation

## Next Steps
- Expand data collection period
- Analyze signal accuracy patterns
- Develop improved prediction model
