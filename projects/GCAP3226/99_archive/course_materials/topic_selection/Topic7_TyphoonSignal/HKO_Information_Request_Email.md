Subject: Request for Information under Code on Access to Information - Typhoon Signal No. 8 Data Verification (September 8-9, 2025)

Dear Hong Kong Observatory Data Services Team,

I am writing to request access to information under the Code on Access to Information Ordinance (Cap. 552) for academic research purposes at Hong Kong Baptist University.

**RESEARCH CONTEXT:**
We are conducting an academic study on typhoon signal accuracy and decision-making processes, specifically examining the Signal No. 8 issued on September 8-9, 2025. Our research, led by Dr. Simon Wang (Language Centre, HKBU, simonwang@hkbu.edu.hk), has developed a real-time wind monitoring system that compares official signals with calculated assessments based on publicly available wind data.

**RESEARCH FINDINGS REQUIRING VERIFICATION:**
Our analysis of publicly available HKO API data during the September 8-9, 2025 Signal No. 8 event has revealed potential discrepancies between actual wind measurements and the signal criteria. Specifically:

1. **Signal Maintenance Period**: The early announcement to maintain Signal No. 8 until 11:00 AM on September 9, 2025
2. **Wind Data Analysis**: Our system monitoring 30 weather stations found that wind measurements frequently did not meet the official Signal No. 8 criteria (â‰¥50% of reference stations recording sustained winds of 63-117 km/h)
3. **Decision Timeline**: The unusually early commitment to a specific signal duration

**INFORMATION REQUESTED:**
To verify our findings and ensure academic accuracy, we respectfully request the following information for the period September 8-9, 2025:

**1. Official Wind Measurements:**
- Raw 10-minute wind data from all 8 reference anemometer stations used for Signal No. 8 decisions
- Timestamp records of when each station met/did not meet Signal No. 8 wind criteria
- Quality control flags and data validation records for the reference stations

**2. Decision Documentation:**
- Internal meteorological assessments and rationale for Signal No. 8 issuance timing
- Documentation of the decision to announce Signal No. 8 maintenance until 11:00 AM on September 9
- Meeting minutes or briefing notes regarding signal timing decisions
- Weather forecast models and typhoon track predictions used in decision-making

**3. Reference Station Data:**
- Confirmation of which 8 stations were used as reference anemometers during this event
- Any station maintenance, calibration, or technical issues during September 8-9, 2025
- Backup procedures used if any reference stations were offline

**4. Public Communication Timeline:**
- Timestamps of all official signal announcements and updates
- Decision points for signal changes or maintenance announcements
- Media briefing schedules and preparation materials

**ACADEMIC PURPOSE AND PUBLIC INTEREST:**
This research aims to:
- Enhance public understanding of typhoon signal decision-making processes
- Contribute to meteorological research on warning system accuracy
- Provide transparency in public safety decision-making
- Support evidence-based improvements to typhoon warning systems

Our findings will be used for academic publication and public education, with proper attribution to HKO data sources. We are committed to responsible use of any provided information.

**DATA COMPARISON:**
For transparency, we are sharing our publicly collected data that raised these research questions:
- 30-station wind monitoring data from September 8-9, 2025
- Calculated signal assessments based on published HKO criteria
- Public API data logs and analysis results

**REQUEST JUSTIFICATION:**
Under the Code on Access to Information, this request serves the public interest by:
- Supporting academic research on public safety systems
- Enhancing transparency in government decision-making
- Contributing to scientific understanding of meteorological warning systems
- Providing evidence for potential system improvements

**PROPOSED DATA FORMAT:**
We would prefer to receive the requested information in:
- CSV format for numerical data
- PDF format for documentation
- Electronic format to facilitate academic analysis

**CONTACT INFORMATION:**
