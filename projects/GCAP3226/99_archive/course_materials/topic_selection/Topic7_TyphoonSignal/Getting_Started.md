# Typhoon Signal Accuracy Analysis - Getting Started Guide

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the accuracy of Hong Kong Observatory's typhoon signal decisions by comparing actual wind measurement data from 30 weather stations with the criteria for issuing No. 8 typhoon signals, building on initial API-based analysis.

## Background Context
- **Current Practice**: HKO makes early No. 8 signal announcements with commitments (e.g., until 11am)
- **Initial Finding**: API analysis of 30 stations shows most measurements don't meet No. 8 criteria
- **Technical Setup**: Weather station API access already established
- **Policy Impact**: Public safety, economic impact of signal decisions

## Key Research Questions
1. How accurately do typhoon signal decisions reflect actual wind conditions?
2. What factors beyond wind speed influence signal timing decisions?
3. How can signal accuracy and timing be improved?
4. What are the economic and social impacts of signal timing decisions?

## Data Sources & Availability
### Primary Data (Already Accessible)
- **HKO API**: Real-time wind data from 30 weather stations
- **Signal Records**: Historical typhoon signal announcements and timing
- **Wind Criteria**: Official thresholds for different signal levels

### Additional Data Opportunities
- **Economic Impact**: Business closure costs, transport disruption
- **Social Impact**: Public safety incidents, emergency response
- **International Comparison**: Other regions' typhoon warning systems

## Methodology Framework
### Phase 1: Data Collection and Validation
- Expand API data collection period and scope
- Validate wind measurement accuracy across stations
- Document signal announcement patterns

### Phase 2: Accuracy Analysis
- Compare actual wind data with signal criteria
- Identify patterns in signal timing vs. conditions
- Analyze geographic variations in wind measurements

### Phase 3: Improvement Recommendations
- Propose signal accuracy improvements
- Develop timing optimization strategies
- Consider economic and social factors in recommendations

## Technical Tools

- **Statistical Analysis**: Pattern recognition and accuracy measurement
- **Visualization**: Mapping wind patterns and signal decisions
- **Time Series Analysis**: Temporal patterns in wind and signal data

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Accuracy Report**: Comprehensive analysis of signal vs. actual conditions
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Identification of systematic timing issues
3. **Improvement Strategy**: Recommendations for enhanced accuracy
4. **Policy Brief**: Summary for HKO and government decision-makers

## Getting Started Steps
1. **Week 1**: Expand API data collection and validate existing analysis
2. **Week 2**: Collect historical signal announcement data and criteria
3. **Week 3**: Develop comprehensive accuracy measurement framework
4. **Week 4**: Begin pattern analysis and identify improvement opportunities

## Technical Setup Required
### API Management
- **Data Collection**: Automated scripts for continuous monitoring
- **Data Storage**: Database for historical wind and signal data
- **Quality Control**: Validation of sensor data and missing value handling

### Analysis Framework
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Statistical measures of signal appropriateness
- **Geographic Analysis**: Spatial patterns in wind measurements
- **Temporal Analysis**: Timing patterns and decision delays

## Key Investigation Areas
### Signal Accuracy
- **False Positives**: Signals issued without meeting wind criteria
- **False Negatives**: Conditions met but signals not issued/delayed
- **Geographic Variations**: Different accuracy across regions of Hong Kong

### Decision Factors
- **Beyond Wind Speed**: Other meteorological factors (pressure, direction, gusts)
- **Economic Considerations**: Impact of signal timing on business/transport
- **Safety Margins**: Conservative approaches to public safety

### Improvement Opportunities
- **Enhanced Prediction**: Better forecasting models
- **Real-time Adjustment**: Dynamic signal modification based on conditions
- **Communication**: Clearer public explanation of signal decisions
