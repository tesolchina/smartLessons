# Bus Routes Coordination Project

## Overview
There are two bus routes 272A (KMB) and 582 (CityBus) that have about 8 overlapped stops. We are exploring whether the two bus companies can coordinate the time tables to optimize the outcome.

## Status
- A bit of work has been done

## Research Questions
- How can competing bus operators coordinate schedules?
- What is the optimal timing coordination for overlapping routes?
- What are the benefits for passengers and operators?

## Data Sources
- Route 272A (KMB) timetables and ridership
- Route 582 (CityBus) timetables and ridership
- Overlapping stops analysis
- Passenger transfer patterns

## Next Steps
- Map the 8 overlapping stops
- Analyze current scheduling gaps
- Develop coordination optimization model
