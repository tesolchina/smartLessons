# Open Data Exploration - Getting Started Guide

## Project Overview
This **versatile and open-ended** project is designed for teams who wish to explore new topics with exciting uncertainty. Unlike other topics with solid foundations and prior work, this option allows students to build something completely new by systematically exploring data.gov.hk to find datasets suitable for government policy analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Project Requirements

### Team Patience and Systematic Exploration
- **Be Patient:** Teams must systematically go through different datasets on data.gov.hk
- **No Quick Fixes:** This is not a topic for teams wanting immediate, clear direction
- **Exploration Process:** Expect to examine multiple datasets before finding the right fit
- **Documentation Required:** Keep detailed records of your exploration process

### Dataset Selection Criteria
- **ONE Specific Dataset:** Teams must select exactly one dataset for their project focus
- **Government Policy Connection:** Dataset must connect to specific government policy or decision
- **Clear Justification:** Provide rationale for why this dataset was chosen over others explored

### Analysis Approach Decision
Teams must choose ONE of two analysis approaches based on dataset characteristics:

#### Option A: Quantitative Modeling (Preferred)
- **Requirements:** Dataset must support regression analysis or simulation modeling
- **Approach:** Develop predictive models, trend analysis, or simulation scenarios
- **Focus:** Use quantitative methods to generate policy insights and recommendations

#### Option B: Data Governance Improvement (Alternative)
- **When to Choose:** If dataset is primarily descriptive and doesn't support robust modeling
- **Approach:** Analyze current data governance practices and propose improvements
- **Focus:** Recommend how government could curate better data to support future analysis
