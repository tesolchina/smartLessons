# Bus Frequency Optimization - Getting Started Guide

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing bus frequencies to improve public transport efficiency. You'll analyze real-world data from route 272A and develop data-driven recommendations for the Transport Department.

## Background Context
- **Current Situation**: Bus frequency decisions often lack systematic data analysis
- **Case Study**: Route 272A in Simon's neighborhood
- **Stakeholder**: Transport Department (TD) - data request already submitted
- **Expected Outcome**: Evidence-based frequency optimization framework

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEW: Existing Research Materials Available**
Your topic folder now contains valuable research materials to jumpstart your analysis:

### ðŸ“Š **Jupyter Notebook: `05_final_code.ipynb`**
- **Contains**: Complete data analysis workflow for bus frequency optimization
- **Includes**: Data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization code
- **Key Features**: Route 272A analysis, ridership pattern modeling, optimization algorithms
- **Status**: Ready-to-run analysis that you can build upon and extend

### ðŸ“‹ **Policy Document: `2024-25 rpp consultation paper_n (rev)(1.3.2024).pdf`**
- **Contains**: Official Route Planning Programme consultation paper
- **Relevance**: Government's current approach to bus route and frequency planning
- **Use Case**: Understanding policy context and decision-making frameworks
- **Key Value**: Real policy document showing how frequency decisions are currently made

## Key Research Questions
1. What factors should determine optimal bus frequency?
2. How does ridership vary throughout the day/week?
3. What is the relationship between frequency and passenger satisfaction?
4. How can we balance cost efficiency with service quality?

## Data Sources & Availability
### âœ… **Confirmed Sources - NOW AVAILABLE**
- **Existing Analysis**: `05_final_code.ipynb` contains processed route 272A data and analysis
- **Policy Framework**: `2024-25 rpp consultation paper_n (rev)(1.3.2024).pdf` shows current TD planning approach
- **Transport Department**: Official ridership and operational data (pending response to new requests)
- **Public Data**: data.gov.hk transport datasets

### Potential Additional Sources (for your extension)
- Real-time bus arrival data
- Passenger satisfaction surveys
- Cost per service hour data
- Weather impact on ridership
- Comparative analysis with other routes

## Methodology Framework
### Phase 1: Review Existing Work (NEW - Start Here!)
- **Analyze `05_final_code.ipynb`**: Understand the completed analysis and methodology
- **Review policy document**: Extract key insights from the consultation paper
- **Identify gaps**: What questions remain unanswered? What data is missing?

### Phase 2: Data Collection & Extension
- Follow up on TD data requests for updated/additional data
- Collect supplementary public transport data
- Gather data for comparative analysis or validation

### Phase 3: Enhanced Analysis
- Extend the existing model with new data or methodologies
- Time series analysis of ridership patterns
- Advanced optimization algorithms
- Scenario testing and sensitivity analysis

### Phase 4: Policy Recommendations
- Build upon existing findings
- Develop implementation roadmap
- Cost-effectiveness analysis
- Data governance recommendations

## Technical Tools
- **Ready-to-Use**: `05_final_code.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with complete analysis workflow
- **Data Analysis**: Python/R for statistical modeling (existing code available)
- **Visualization**: Charts for ridership patterns and optimization results (examples in notebook)
- **Modeling**: Regression analysis, simulation models (implemented examples available)

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start Guide - Your First Steps**
1. **Open `05_final_code.ipynb`** - Run through the existing analysis to understand the methodology
2. **Read the consultation paper** - Understand current policy approach and identify gaps
3. **Identify your angle** - What specific aspect will you focus on or improve?
4. **Plan your extension** - How will you build upon the existing work?

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Enhanced Analysis Report**: Building upon existing Route 272A analysis with new insights
2. **Improved Optimization Model**: Extending or refining the frequency determination algorithm
3. **Policy Implementation Brief**: Practical recommendations based on existing and new findings
4. **Data Governance Evaluation**: Assessment of current TD data practices and recommendations

## Getting Started Steps (UPDATED)
