I'll help create a comprehensive revision addressing all feedback points. Let me structure this systematically.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The regression analysis framework has been substantially enhanced to address key methodological concerns while maintaining practical applicability. Major improvements include:

1. **Enhanced Statistical Rigor**
- Added instrumental variables approach for endogeneity
- Implemented robust validation procedures
- Strengthened causal inference methodology

2. **Improved Data Collection Strategy**
- Revised sample size calculations with power analysis
- Added pilot study phase
- Enhanced missing data procedures

3. **Strengthened Policy Integration**
- Added Hong Kong-specific regulatory context
- Enhanced cost-benefit framework
- Improved implementation guidance

4. **Technical Enhancements**
- Added non-linear specifications
- Enhanced interaction effects
- Improved model diagnostics

3. Preliminary analysis

### Phase 3: Full Deployment (3-4 months)
1. Complete data collection
2. Analysis execution
3. Policy recommendation development

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Adjustment (1-2 months)
1. Framework assessment
2. Refinement based on experience
3. Documentation of lessons learned

## VALIDATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
