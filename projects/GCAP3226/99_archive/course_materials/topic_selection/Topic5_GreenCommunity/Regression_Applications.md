# Regression Applications in Green@Community Recycling Analysis (Topic 5)

## Current Project Context

**Research Question**: What is the cost-effectiveness of Hong Kong's Green@Community recycling initiative, and how can it be optimized for better return on investment?

**Key Finding**: Despite HK$270 million in operating costs for 2022-23, the program collected only 20,300 tonnes of recyclables (1.06% of Hong Kong's total recyclables), resulting in HK$13,300 per tonne cost

**Current Approach**: Cost-effectiveness review and optimization recommendations based on published letter and financial analysis

## Regression Analysis Applications

### 1. **Linear Regression Models**

#### A. Cost Efficiency Prediction
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Cost per tonne of recyclables collected (HK$/tonne)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Number of collection points per district
- Population density around collection points
- Collection frequency (times per week)
- Staff-to-point ratio
- Transportation distance to processing facilities
- Type of recyclables collected
- Community income level
- Educational attainment in area

**Model**:
```
Cost_per_Tonne = β₀ + β₁(Collection_Points) + β₂(Pop_Density) + β₃(Frequency) + β₄(Distance) + ε
```

**Expected Relationships**:
- More collection points → Higher costs (positive coefficient)
- Higher population density → Lower cost per tonne (negative coefficient)
- Longer transport distance → Higher costs (positive coefficient)

#### B. Collection Volume Prediction
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Monthly recyclables collected per collection point (tonnes)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Local population within 500m radius
- Community income level
- Education level (% with tertiary education)
- Age distribution (% elderly, % young families)
- Housing type (public vs private)
- Competing recycling facilities nearby
- Public awareness campaign intensity
- Convenience factors (opening hours, accessibility)

**Model**:
```
Collection_Volume = β₀ + β₁(Population) + β₂(Income) + β₃(Education) + β₄(Awareness) + β₅(Convenience) + ε
```

#### C. Program ROI Analysis
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Return on investment ratio (environmental benefits + economic value)/(program costs)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Total program expenditure
- Material recovery rates by type
- Environmental impact score (carbon savings, landfill diversion)
- Community participation rate
- Economic value of recovered materials
- Administrative efficiency score

**Model**:
```
ROI = β₀ + β₁(Expenditure) + β₂(Recovery_Rate) + β₃(Environmental_Impact) + β₄(Participation) + ε
```

### 2. **Logistic Regression Models**

#### A. Program Viability Assessment
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Program sustainability (1 = Financially viable, 0 = Not viable)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Cost per tonne threshold (< HK$5,000)
- Community participation rate (% of households)
- Material recovery rate (% of potential recyclables)
- Government funding stability
- Alternative waste management cost

**Model**:
```
P(Viable = 1) = 1 / (1 + e^-(β₀ + β₁(Cost_per_Tonne) + β₂(Participation) + β₃(Recovery_Rate) + β₄(Public_Support)))
```

**Policy Application**: Identify conditions for program sustainability

- Economic conditions
- Policy changes
- Competing programs

**Model**:
```
Collection_t = α + β₁(Time) + β₂(Season_t) + β₃(Awareness_t) + β₄(Economy_t) + AR(1) + ε_t

- Regulatory changes

### 5. **Spatial Regression**

#### A. Geographic Performance Analysis
**Account for spatial correlation** between nearby collection points:

**Model**:
```
Performance_i = ρW×Performance_j + β₁(Demographics_i) + β₂(Infrastructure_i) + ε_i
```

Where W is spatial weight matrix capturing geographic proximity

#### B. Spillover Effects
**Analyze how success at one location affects nearby locations**:
- Competition effects
- Complementary effects
- Information spillovers

## Policy Applications of Regression Results

### 1. **Program Optimization Framework**
Based on regression analysis:

#### Cost Reduction Strategies:
```
IF: Cost_per_Tonne > HK$8,000 
THEN: Implement efficiency measures based on regression coefficients
```

#### Site Selection Criteria:
```
New_Site_Score = β₁(Population_Density) + β₂(Income_Level) + β₃(Education) + β₄(Accessibility)
```

### 2. **Performance Monitoring System**
Regression-based KPIs:
```
Efficiency_Score = 0.4×(Cost_Performance) + 0.3×(Volume_Performance) + 0.2×(Participation_Rate) + 0.1×(Environmental_Impact)
```

### 3. **Resource Allocation Model**
```
Budget_Allocation_i = Base_Budget × (1 + Performance_Multiplier_i + Potential_Multiplier_i)
```

---

## Expected Regression Findings

### 1. **Cost Efficiency Model Results**
```
Cost_per_Tonne = 15,000 - 250(Pop_Density) + 0.5(Distance_to_Facility) + 1,200(Low_Participation)
R² = 0.68, p < 0.001
```

**Interpretation**: 
- Each 1,000 people/km² density reduces cost by HK$250/tonne
- Each km to facility increases cost by HK$0.50/tonne
- Low participation areas cost HK$1,200/tonne more

### 2. **Optimal Performance Conditions**
```
P(High_Performance) = 0.85 when Pop_Density ≥ 8,000/km² AND Education ≥ 70% tertiary
P(High_Performance) = 0.25 when Pop_Density < 3,000/km² OR Education < 40% tertiary
```

**Site Strategy**: Prioritize dense, educated communities for new collection points

### 3. **Break-even Analysis**
```
Cost_per_Tonne = 5,000 (viable threshold)
Required_Volume = Fixed_Costs / (5,000 - Variable_Cost_per_Tonne)
```

**Policy Implication**: Collection points need minimum 2.5 tonnes/month to be viable

### 4. **International Comparison**
```
HK_Efficiency = International_Benchmark × (1 - 0.35×Density_Advantage - 0.25×Scale_Disadvantage)
```

**Finding**: HK's high density should reduce costs by 35%, but small scale increases costs by 25%

## Optimization Recommendations Based on Regression

### 1. **Site Selection and Closure**
- **Close sites** where predicted cost > HK$10,000/tonne
- **Prioritize expansion** in areas with predicted cost < HK$7,000/tonne
- **Consolidate** underperforming sites within 1km of each other

### 2. **Service Design Optimization**
- **Increase frequency** in high-density areas (regression shows higher volume)
- **Reduce frequency** in low-participation areas to cut costs
- **Implement mobile collection** for areas too small for permanent sites

### 3. **Community Engagement Strategy**
Target interventions based on regression findings:
- **Education campaigns** in areas with low education levels
- **Convenience improvements** in areas with high participation potential
- **Incentive programs** where cost-effectiveness is marginal

### 4. **Performance Monitoring**
- **Monthly regression updates** to adjust predictions with new data
- **Automated alerts** when sites fall below efficiency thresholds
- **Predictive maintenance** scheduling based on usage patterns

## Integration with Cost-Effectiveness Review

### 1. **Current Performance Assessment**
Use regression to explain current HK$13,300/tonne cost:
- Identify key cost drivers
- Compare to predicted optimal performance
- Quantify potential savings

### 2. **Reform Scenario Modeling**
Apply regression models to evaluate:
- Site consolidation impacts
- Service frequency changes
- Alternative collection models
- Technology upgrades

### 3. **Budget Reallocation**
Regression-informed budget optimization:
- Shift resources from low-efficiency to high-efficiency sites
- Invest in areas with highest improvement potential
- Reduce spending on permanently underperforming areas

This regression-based approach will provide the quantitative foundation needed to transform the Green@Community program from a cost-intensive initiative into an efficient, evidence-based recycling system that maximizes environmental benefits per dollar spent.
