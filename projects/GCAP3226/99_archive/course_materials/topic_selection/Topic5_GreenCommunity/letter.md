Public money should be spent on cost-effective recycling
We agree with your correspondent that Hong Kong must prioritise reducing waste at source (“Single-use plastic alternatives distract from real solutions”, May 12). However, as recycling remains a key part of our waste strategy, it is crucial that such programmes deliver real value.
The Green@Community recycling initiative now covers 85 per cent of the population with about 630 collection points. Despite receiving more than 5.2 million visitors in 2022, the programme collected just 20,300 tonnes of recyclables – only 1.06 per cent of Hong Kong’s total recyclables.
With operating costs for the recycling stations and stores coming to HK$270 million for 2022-23, this suggests that about HK$13,300 could have been spent per tonne. If all recyclables in the city had been recovered at this rate, about HK$25 billion would have been spent, overshooting the HK$5.2 billion waste management budget for that year.

Only with greater accountability and transparency can Hong Kong ensure public funds are supporting the most cost-effective solutions for solid waste management. Therefore, we urge the Audit Commission, the Ombudsman and the Legislative Council Panel on Environmental Affairs to review the programme, so that the Environmental Protection Department may be incentivised to adopt more innovative and efficient approaches – starting with waste reduction at source, as your correspondent suggested.
