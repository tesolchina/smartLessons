# Regression Plan Revision Chatbot

## Overview
This AI-powered chatbot takes an original regression analysis document and expert feedback to generate an improved version with detailed change tracking and justification.

## Features
- **Intelligent Revision**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze feedback and improve methodology
- **Change Tracking**: Documents all modifications with clear rationale
- **Focus Areas**: Supports targeted revisions (methodology, technical, policy, practical)
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintains statistical rigor while preserving practical applicability

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Python packages**: `requests` (usually pre-installed)
2. **API Key**: OpenRouter API key in parent directory `.env` file
3. **Configuration**: `revision_config.json` (included)

### Quick Test
```bash
cd /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/GCAP3226prep/Chatbots/revise_application_plan
python plan_revisor.py --help
```

## Usage

### Basic Revision
```bash
python plan_revisor.py [original_file] [feedback_file] [output_file]
```

### Targeted Revisions
```bash
# Focus on statistical methodology
python plan_revisor.py original.md feedback.md revised.md --focus methodology

# Focus on technical improvements
python plan_revisor.py original.md feedback.md revised.md --focus technical

# Focus on policy integration
python plan_revisor.py original.md feedback.md revised.md --focus policy

# Focus on practical feasibility
python plan_revisor.py original.md feedback.md revised.md --focus practical

# Comprehensive revision (default)
python plan_revisor.py original.md feedback.md revised.md --focus comprehensive
```

### Example with Topic 1
```bash
# Revise Topic 1 based on AI assessment
python plan_revisor.py \
  "../../TopicSelectionPM/Topic1_BusFrequency/Regression_Applications.md" \
  "../../TopicSelectionPM/Topic1_BusFrequency/AI_Assessment_Results.md" \
  "../../TopicSelectionPM/Topic1_BusFrequency/Revised_Regression_Framework.md"
```

## Revision Process

### Input Documents
1. **Original Analysis**: The initial regression analysis framework
2. **Expert Feedback**: AI assessment results with specific recommendations

### Processing Steps
1. **Analysis**: Reviews both documents to understand current state and recommendations
2. **Planning**: Identifies key areas for improvement based on feedback
3. **Revision**: Generates enhanced framework addressing all major concerns
4. **Documentation**: Tracks all changes with clear rationale

### Output Structure
1. **Executive Summary**: Overview of major changes and improvements
2. **Detailed Revision Log**: Specific changes with justification
3. **Enhanced Framework**: Complete revised document
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: Practical deployment guidance
5. **Quality Assurance**: Validation and monitoring procedures

## Revision Categories

### Methodology Improvements (40% weight)
- Address endogeneity concerns
- Add interaction terms and non-linear specifications
- Include robust diagnostic procedures
- Enhance model validation strategies

### Technical Enhancements (25% weight)
- Specify model assumptions and diagnostic tests
- Add cross-validation and robustness checks
- Include sample size calculations
- Address multicollinearity issues

### Policy Integration (20% weight)
- Strengthen policy-analysis connection
- Add implementation timeline
- Include stakeholder consultation
- Enhance cost-benefit framework

### Practical Feasibility (15% weight)
- Address data collection challenges
- Include phased implementation strategy
- Add contingency planning
- Specify technical requirements

## Quality Standards

- **Statistical Rigor**: All procedures meet academic standards
- **Policy Relevance**: Clear connection to practical applications
- **Implementability**: Feasible within stated constraints
- **Documentation**: All changes clearly justified
- **Reproducibility**: Analysis replicable by others

## Example Output Format

```markdown
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHANGES
- Enhanced endogeneity treatment with instrumental variables approach
- Added comprehensive interaction analysis framework
- Strengthened validation procedures with cross-validation
- Improved implementation timeline with phased rollout strategy

## DETAILED REVISION LOG

**CHANGE:** Methodology - Added instrumental variables for frequency-demand endogeneity
**RATIONALE:** AI feedback identified simultaneity bias in frequency-demand relationship
**IMPACT:** Enables causal inference and strengthens policy recommendations

**CHANGE:** Technical - Included VIF analysis for multicollinearity detection
**RATIONALE:** Assessment recommended explicit multicollinearity testing
**IMPACT:** Improves model reliability and interpretation accuracy

## Error Handling

The chatbot handles:
- Missing input files
- API connection issues
- Invalid configuration
- Large document processing
- Network timeouts

## Support Files

- `revision_config.json`: Revision guidelines and formatting rules
- `plan_revisor.py`: Main chatbot application
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Integration with Assessment System

This revisor works seamlessly with the regression assessment chatbot:

1. **Step 1**: Assess original document with `regression_assessor.py`
2. **Step 2**: Use assessment output as feedback for `plan_revisor.py`
3. **Step 3**: Generate improved framework with detailed change tracking

Perfect for iterative improvement of regression analysis frameworks!
