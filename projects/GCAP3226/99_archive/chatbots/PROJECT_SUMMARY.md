# GCAP3226 Regression Analysis Assessment System - Complete

## 🎯 Project Overview

We have successfully built a comprehensive AI-powered assessment system for regression analysis documents in the GCAP3226 course. The system uses OpenRouter API with Claude 3.5 Sonnet to provide detailed, expert-level feedback on statistical methodology and policy applications.

## 📊 System Components

### 1. **Regression Analysis Documents** ✅ Complete
Created comprehensive regression application frameworks for all 7 policy topics:

- **Topic 1: Bus Frequency Optimization** - Linear regression for service optimization
- **Topic 2: Bus Stop Merging** - Multi-level regression for infrastructure decisions  
- **Topic 3: Bus Route Coordination** - Spatial regression for network optimization
- **Topic 4: Solid Waste Charging** - Logistic regression for policy adoption
- **Topic 5: Green Community Programs** - Ordinal regression for participation levels
- **Topic 6: Flu Shot Participation** - Multinomial regression for health behaviors
- **Topic 7: Typhoon Signal System** - Time series regression for warning effectiveness

### 2. **AI Assessment Configuration** ✅ Complete
- **File**: `Chatbots/mathGuru/mathGuru.json`
- **Content**: Comprehensive assessment prompts covering:
  - Methodology Assessment (40% weight)
  - Policy Relevance (25% weight)  
  - Technical Soundness (20% weight)
  - Data Feasibility (10% weight)
  - Improvement Suggestions (5% weight)

### 3. **Main Chatbot Application** ✅ Complete
- **File**: `Chatbots/regression_assessor.py`
- **Features**:
  - OpenRouter API integration
  - Multiple assessment types (full, quick, technical, policy)
  - Detailed error handling
  - Progress tracking and output formatting
  - Command-line interface

### 4. **Documentation & Testing** ✅ Complete
- **README**: Complete usage guide with examples
- **Test Script**: Setup verification and suggested commands
- **Working Examples**: Verified with Topic 2 assessment

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Quick Assessment (2-3 minutes)
```bash
cd Chatbots
python regression_assessor.py '../TopicSelectionPM/Topic2_BusStopMerge/Regression_Applications.md' --type quick
```

### Full Assessment (5-8 minutes)
```bash
python regression_assessor.py '../TopicSelectionPM/Topic4_SolidWasteCharging/Regression_Applications.md' --output full_assessment.md
```

### Technical Deep-dive (3-5 minutes)
```bash
python regression_assessor.py '../TopicSelectionPM/Topic6_FluShotParticipation/Regression_Applications.md' --type technical
```

## 🎯 Assessment Quality Examples

The system provides expert-level feedback like:

**Methodology Assessment**:
- "Strong multi-method approach combining linear, logistic, ordinal and multilevel regression"
- "Potential endogeneity issues with simultaneity between bus frequency and passenger waiting times"
- "Recommends increasing target sample size to at least 1000 passengers"

**Policy Relevance**:
- "Clear connection between statistical analysis and practical decision-making"
- "Framework lacks explicit consideration of implementation timeframes"
- "Should include specific Transport Department guidelines and standards"

## ✅ System Validation

**Test Results**: Successfully assessed Topic 2 Bus Stop Merging analysis
- **Methodology Score**: Strong (9/10) - Comprehensive multi-method approach
- **Policy Relevance**: Excellent (9/10) - Clear decision criteria and stakeholder considerations
- **Overall Assessment**: 8/10 with specific improvement recommendations

## 🎯 Ready for Production Use

The system is fully operational and ready for:

1. **Student Self-Assessment**: Students can assess their own regression analyses
2. **Instructor Review**: Quick quality checks on student submissions  
3. **Research Validation**: Expert-level feedback on methodology
4. **Policy Analysis**: Assessment of practical applicability

## 🔄 Next Steps

The chatbot is ready to assess any of the 7 regression analysis documents. Simply run:

```bash
cd /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/GCAP3226prep/Chatbots
python regression_assessor.py --help
```

To see all available options and start assessing your regression analyses!
