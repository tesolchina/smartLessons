we need to build an AI chatbot here 

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/GCAP3226prep/Chatbots

using the API key /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/GCAP3226prep/Chatbots/.env (make sure do not upload to GitHub) 

and update /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/GCAP3226prep/Chatbots/mathGuru/mathGuru.json to write some prompts 

the idea is to take some files such as /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/GCAP3226prep/TopicSelectionPM/Topic2_BusStopMerge/Regression_Applications.md and send it to an LLM via openrouter together with some prompts from mathGuru.json to assess whether the info and instructions from the file makes sense and are reliable
