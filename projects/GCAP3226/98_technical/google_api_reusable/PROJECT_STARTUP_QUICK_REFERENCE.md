## 📅 **Project Timeline Guidance**

### **Week 1-2 Priorities:**
- ✅ Government Decision Mapping (5-7 decisions per team)
- ✅ Data Request Strategy (draft information requests)
- ✅ Model Selection (choose 2-3 mathematical approaches)
- ✅ Resource Inventory (catalog available tools and data)

### **Week 3-4 Priorities:**
- 📊 Data Collection (submit government requests)
- 🔍 Preliminary Analysis (exploratory data analysis)
- 🏛️ Governance Evaluation (assess transparency practices)
- 📋 Progress Review (mid-project instructor check-in)

### **Week 5-6 Priorities:**
- 🔢 Advanced Analysis (implement mathematical models)
- 📈 Policy Implications (connect findings to government decisions)
- 💡 Governance Recommendations (suggest improvements)
- 🎯 Final Presentation (comprehensive project results)

## 🎯 **Example: Team 1 (Flu Shot Participation)**

### Government Decisions to Analyze:
1. Department of Health vaccination program policies
2. Education Bureau school health program requirements
3. Government Vaccination Programme (GVP) design decisions
4. Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS) eligibility criteria
5. School-based vaccination program implementation policies
6. Nasal spray vaccine approval and adoption decisions
7. Post-COVID vaccination strategy modifications

### Data Governance Tasks:
1. Review Department of Health vaccination data collection practices
2. Analyze school-based health data sharing between departments
3. Evaluate transparency of vaccination statistics publication
4. Request current participation rate data through information requests
5. Assess data quality in vaccination monitoring systems
6. Review privacy protection measures for health data
7. Analyze international best practices for vaccination data governance

### Mathematical Models:
1. Logistic Regression Models (predict participation)
2. Time Series Analysis (vaccination rate trends)
3. Survival Analysis (time-to-vaccination patterns)
4. Causal Inference Models (policy intervention impacts)
5. Bayesian Networks (barrier relationships)
6. Cost-Effectiveness Models (delivery method comparison)
7. Propensity Score Matching (observational study controls)
