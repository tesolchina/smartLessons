## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY INSTRUCTOR CONSULTATION**

### **Students MUST consult with instructors before selecting models:**

üí° **INSTRUCTOR CONSULTATION REQUIRED:**
- Discuss model selection with Dr. Wang or Dr. Wu before implementation
- Consider data availability and complexity when choosing approaches
- Start with simpler regression models before advancing to simulation
- Ensure selected models align with your research questions and data

### **Updated Project Timeline:**

**Week 1-2 Priorities:**
- ‚úÖ Government Decision Mapping (5-7 decisions per team)
- ‚úÖ Data Request Strategy (draft information requests)
- ‚úÖ **Model Selection: Choose 1-2 regression or simulation approaches WITH INSTRUCTOR CONSULTATION**
- ‚úÖ Resource Inventory (catalog available tools and data)

## üìã **Key Changes for Students**

1. **Focused Scope:** Only regression and simulation models are appropriate for this course
2. **Consultation Required:** Must discuss model selection with instructors before proceeding
3. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic regression before advancing to complex simulations
4. **Data-Driven:** Model choice must match available data and research questions
