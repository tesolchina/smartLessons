      "notes": "1. Address Lookup Service is a web service providing lookup function on Hong Kong address records in both Chinese and English aggregated from various Government Bureaux/Departments. This web service allows data consumers to look up address records in machine-readable format (XML or JSON) using address element information. It aims to facilitate development of applications with the need to capture Hong Kong address information more efficiently and accurately.\n2. The Address Lookup Service provides formatted addresses of the premises in Hong Kong, including private and public housing estates, commercial and industrial buildings, government buildings and offices, markets and shopping centers; and common facilities such as recreation and sports centres.  Some addresses provided are representing a complex of buildings, such as schools or universities.  Most of the addresses in Address Lookup Service are available in 2-Dimensional format which typically includes up to street name, building number and building name. 3-Dimensional formatted addresses, such as addresses include flat number and floor number, they are only available for public housing estates. For more details, please refer the Data Dictionary.\n3. This service also includes unofficial descriptions of buildings which are long established addresses in rural areas of the New Territories and are generally accepted by the public. \n4. The choice of name for a building is a matter for the owner, and at present there is no controlling legislation. The inclusion of a building name in this service confers no proprietary right to it or any part of it.\n5. As there are no regulations requiring owners or developers to report or register building names, the Address Lookup Service is not exhaustive. The accuracy and timeliness of its contents cannot be guaranteed. Particularly for some new buildings, the confirmation of address particulars involves business processes and coordination of multiple departments, such as surveying, reviewing data, and assigning geographical addresses, etc., which can take time to complete. Nonetheless, every effort has been made to include all known names and to check the correctness of entries. We welcome notifications from any source of new names, changes in existing names, the discontinuation of the use of names, and any omissions or errors in this service.",

      "notes": "###GENERAL NOTES :###\nThe Territorial Population and Employment Data Matrix (TPEDM) is compiled by the Planning Department and updated regularly to tie in with the updated population projections of the Population Census. It provides estimated data on territorial distributions of population and employment in the future years for use as reference materials by government departments and stakeholders involved in the planning of developments and services.\n\nThe 2021-based TPEDM was completed in 2024 by adopting the Census and Statistics Department's projections of territorial population released in August 2023 as the control totals. It includes the population and employment estimates for the base year (i.e. 2021) and the projections for two future years (i.e. 2026 and 2031). The population and employment data is presented in 18 District Council Districts and 5 Sub-regions as shown on [Map 1](https://www.pland.gov.hk/file/resources/population_data/tpedm/2021/Map_1.pdf) and [Map 2](https://www.pland.gov.hk/file/resources/population_data/tpedm/2021/Map_2.pdf).\n\nTPEDM was compiled using different assumptions regarding future territorial population, employment structure, economic growth as well as the planned and latest known development proposals of relevant Government departments, quasi-government bodies and the private sector. The assumptions on future development may be subject to change after the compilation.\n###SPECIAL NOTES :###\n***Population Coverage***\n\nThe population of 2021-based TPEDM refers to land-based Hong Kong Resident Population (HKRP). HKRP comprises “Usual Residents” and “Mobile Residents”, and foreign domestic helpers are included.\n\n(a) “Usual Residents” refer to two categories of people: (i) Hong Kong Permanent Residents who have stayed in Hong Kong for at least 3 months during the 6 months before or for at least 3 months during the 6 months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point; and (ii) Hong Kong Non-permanent Residents who are in Hong Kong at the reference time-point.\n\n(b) For those Hong Kong Permanent Residents who are not “Usual Residents”, they are classified as “Mobile Residents” if they have stayed in Hong Kong for at least 1 month but less than 3 months during the 6 months before or for at least 1 month but less than 3 months during the 6 months after the reference time-point, regardless of whether they are in Hong Kong or not at the reference time-point.\n\nGeographical distribution of population is generally made on the basis of place of residence. Accordingly, population of a particular area is made up of persons who live there.\n\n***Employment Coverage***\n\nEmployment refers to the total number of full or part time jobs with establishments in Hong Kong. Positions taken up by working proprietors, self-employed, temporary employees as well as foreign domestic helpers are included. Jobs with establishments outside Hong Kong are excluded.\n\nEmployment is measured by the number of jobs held. Thus, a person holding more than one job will be counted separately. On the other hand, job vacancies are excluded.\n\nGeographical distribution of employment is generally made on the basis of place of jobs. Accordingly, employment of a particular area is made up of number of jobs there.\n\n***Geographical Demarcation Systems***\n\nThis version of 2021-based TPEDM presents estimates and projections of population and employment distribution at two levels of a geographical demarcation system, namely District Council District (DCD) and Sub-region.\n\n***District Council District (DCD)[1]***\n\nAt the DCD level, the data are grouped and presented in respect of 18 DCDs boundaries (see [Map 1](https://www.pland.gov.hk/file/resources/population_data/tpedm/2021/Map_1.pdf)) to facilitate population and employment data extraction for land use and public facilities planning in District Council level.\n\n[1] The Loop Area is currently not included in a DCD, its figures are included in Yuen Long District.\n\n***Sub-region***\n\nThe whole territory of Hong Kong can also be divided into five Sub-regions (see [Map 2](https://www.pland.gov.hk/file/resources/population_data/tpedm/2021/Map_2.pdf)), namely Metro Area, Northwest New Territories (NWNT), Northeast New Territories (NENT), Southeast New Territories (SENT) and Southwest New Territories (SWNT).\n\nThe multiple file formats are available for dataset download in API.\n###DISCLAIMER###\n***Many detailed working assumptions are involved in compiling the 2021-based TPEDM, changes to which may yield very different results. Although the Planning Department has endeavoured to adopt the best assumptions and data sources available at the time of producing the 2021-based TPEDM, persons making reference to the data therein should decide on the applicability of the data to any specific purpose or use. The Government is not to be held liable for any consequences arising from using the data.***",

At present, when FSD identifies new MSPs coming into operation, joint enforcement action with BD and other related departments will be arranged according to the established mechanism.\n\nIf irregularities on the fire safety construction (e.g. provision of means of escape, fire-resisting construction, means of access for firefighting and rescue) are identified in target MSPs, BD will issue statutory orders under the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) to owners of target MSPs requiring them to carry out rectification works. BD will also register these orders at the Land Registry, imposing an encumbrance on the register. Members of the public may learn about such irregularities through searching the registers.\n\nTo enhance transparency of enforcement actions, BD has also compiled a \"List of Target MSP without Obvious Irregularities\".",

      "notes": "1. The Building Services Tender Price Index (BSTPI) reflects the tender prices for building services installations in new building works undertaken by the Architectural Services Department. It complements the Building Works Tender Price Index for new building works undertaken by Architectural Services Department (BWTPI) which excludes building services works. It was first compiled in the 4th quarter of 1989 and the value for the 4th quarter of 1989 was taken as the base index of 100. Subsequent values are expressed in index form based on the 4th quarter 1989 value. The BSTPI is calculated in a manner similar to the BWTPI. The index value of a quarter is compiled based on a base schedule of items and according to the tendered rates of the items in that quarter.\n\n2. Since the 1st quarter of 1999, the BSTPI figures had been compiled using a revised base schedule of items (1998 base) and with conversion to the common base index 100 at 1989. The index figures as from the 1st quarter of 2009 were compiled using the revised base schedule (2007 base) of items and with conversion to the common base index 100 at 1989.\n\n3. From the 2nd quarter of 2015 onwards, the index figures are compiled using a new base schedule (2012 base) of items which is formulated with reference to the contracts awarded from 3rd quarter of 2009 to 2nd quarter of 2012 and with conversion to the common base index 100 at 1989. The BSTPIs (figures with #) compiled using the new base schedule (2012 base) from the 1st quarter of 2013 to the 2nd quarter of 2014 are also shown for reference.\n",

Information on physical fitness and energy consumption is provided on every track for reference. It is hoped that the public will incorporate fitness walking into their daily life. They, particularly the inactive working population and middle-aged, are encouraged to engage in fitness walking for at least 30 minutes a day, making the first stride to a healthy life.",
