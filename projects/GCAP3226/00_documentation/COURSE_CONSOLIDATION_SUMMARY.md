## 🚧 **Items with Path Length Issues (Preserved in Archive)**

Some folders with extremely long file paths couldn't be copied due to Windows path limitations:
- `topic_selection/` - Contains project topics with long file names
- `resources/datasets/open_data/` - Contains data files with very long names

**Solution:** These remain accessible in `99_archive/course_materials/` for manual access when needed.
