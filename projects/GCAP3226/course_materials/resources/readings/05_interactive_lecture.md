# 📊 The St Martin Bus Stop Case


Data Governance in Action - How Citizens Can Drive Change

Progress: 0% 📊 Report

🚌


## The Problem Discovery


A seemingly simple issue that reveals deeper data governance challenges


### 🗺️ The St Martin Bus Stops


🚏


#### St Martin


North Side (Towards Central)

Bus Stop ID: Unclear in app

🚏


#### St Martin


South Side (Towards Aberdeen)

Bus Stop ID: Unclear in app

**The Confusion:** Both stops appear as "St Martin" in bus tracking apps. Passengers can't tell which side of the street the incoming bus is actually approaching.


### 🤔 Initial Assessment: What type of problem is this?


A) A technology problem - apps need better GPS accuracy  B) A data governance problem - inconsistent naming standards  C) A user experience problem - people need better training  D) A business problem - bus companies need better coordination


#### ✅ Correct! This is fundamentally a data governance issue.


While technology and user experience are affected, the root cause is poor data standards. Without unique identifiers and consistent naming conventions, data quality suffers across all systems.

## Dr. Simon Wang's Advocacy Journey


From problem discovery to solution implementation

1


### Problem Recognition


Dr. Wang experiences confusion multiple times when waiting for buses at St Martin stops. Realizes this affects many daily commuters.

2


### Initial Contact


Emails Transport Department (TD) staff with specific details about the confusion and suggested solutions. Gets polite but ineffective response.

3


### Strategic Escalation


After no action from initial contact, escalates to Assistant Director of TD with clear business case and public safety concerns.

4


### Solution Implementation


TD coordinates with bus companies to add unique identifiers to distinguish the two stops in mobile apps.


### 📧 Analyze the Effective Email Strategy



#### ❌ Initial Email (Ineffective)


  * • Vague complaint without specifics
  * • No clear action requested
  * • Sent to general contact
  * • No business impact mentioned


#### ✅ Escalation Email (Effective)


  * • Specific location and problem details
  * • Clear solution proposed
  * • Sent to decision-maker
  * • Public safety concerns highlighted


### 🎯 What made the escalation successful?


A) Using more emotional language and urgency  B) Reaching the right decision-maker with a clear business case  C) Threatening to go public with the complaint  D) Including multiple government departments in the email


#### ✅ Exactly right!


Effective advocacy requires reaching decision-makers with authority to act, combined with a clear business case that shows impact and provides actionable solutions. This approach is professional and solution-oriented.

## Data Governance & Mathematical Opportunities


From individual problems to systematic analysis


### 🎯 Data Quality Principles Violated


!


#### Uniqueness


Duplicate names without distinguishing identifiers

!


#### Usability


Data structure doesn't match user needs

!


#### Consistency


Different systems may use different naming


### ✅ Mathematical Analysis Opportunities


+


#### Scale Analysis


Find all duplicate bus stop names using data mining

+


#### Impact Modeling

+


#### Optimization


Design optimal naming conventions using algorithms

API DEMO


### Finding Similar Data Issues Programmatically



# Simulate API call to find duplicate bus stop names


import requests, pandas

def find_duplicate_stops():


# Get HK bus stop data


response = requests.get('https://api.data.gov.hk/v1/bus-stops')

stops = response.json()


# Find duplicates


duplicates = stops.groupby('name').filter(lambda x: len(x) > 1)

return duplicates

Results found: 127 duplicate bus stop names across Hong Kong
