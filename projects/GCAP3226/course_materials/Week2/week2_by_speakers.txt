==================================================
SPEAKER: SIMON WANG
==================================================

Alright, so for the first two weeks, we're going to record, our lecture on Zoom.

And, you should be able to refer to the Zoom recording.

And again, this is the second week of our course, GCAP 3226, and please come to the Zoom, including those who are watching this video, you can come to the… our, Moodle classroom, and, you should be able to, find the… Week 1 video, and also transcripts.

just to catch up, you know, I know some of you were not here last week, so if you want to catch up, you want to know more about this course, what we're trying to do, you can just, well, I mean, you probably don't want to watch the whole video, but there's actually transcripts available you can take a look as well.

Now, please go to, week 2 notes.

So, as you can see, we've got in-class and after-class discussion, and then we have week two notes.

So, just a little bit of recap.

I think I have already talked about this, but, the basic course objectives are here.

I don't want to necessarily repeat myself.

You can refer to the, week one video, week one scripts, and also the bullet points here.

And then we have got a, course hub and, You know, there's a course overview, there's a link to the Google Docs and everything.

Again, it's for your reference.

We can update here, but mainly, if you just want more direct access to the materials, you can come back to Moodle.

We don't want to kind of overwhelm you with all the different, information, so we go back to the Moodle… notes.

I don't, I don't necessarily… yeah, okay, so, so maybe we can show the roadmap.

Right, so we have a roadmap.

Again, right now, we are in week two, and because it's during the shopping period, we're not going to ask you to form the groups or select the topics or anything yet, so we're just going to give you a taste of, what we're trying to do, because, the AI tool, using AI to write programming codes, that's kind of one of the highlights Of this course.

And also, it can be a little bit overwhelming and scary, so it's like, we want to eat the frog first, so to speak.

So today, it won't be, like, a full 3-hour session, you know, maybe for some of you from computer science major, it's just, like, a breeze.

It's, very, very, straightforward for you.

But in that case, please do help, all the other, your fellow students, okay?

So, help them a little bit, and help us.

And then starting from, week three and four, we will start, looking at some of the case studies that we're going to focus on in this course, and we're also going to, form groups, and we will invite you to start, picking some projects and start working in this course.

And we do hope that in each group, there will be, you know, students from different backgrounds, so we can work together.

All right?

So, yeah, so the rest of the roadmap, you can just take a look, and this is actually the first time we run this course, so we are still kind of finalize things a bit, so there might be some changes over the course, so… but, in general, I think the rule of thumb is that we try to support you, especially when you are not from a math or computer science background.

So, if you feel like there's a little bit difficult or challenging at this stage, do not worry too much, because we're here to help you, and we want to ensure that this course is Friendly, to everybody, you know, not just for… for students from… from science background, okay?

So, with that, let's move on.

You can look at… there's also assessment information from last week, which we will not repeat, but you can check out.

We are going to offer more information and instruction about the instruction… about the assessment in due course.

Now, we're going to get into the actual hands-on parts of today's work, so, if you can, come to this Moodle page, the notes, you should be able to download the week 2 materials.

It's a zip file, so once you download it, you can unzip it, you should be able to get a folder.

And as you can… once you download it, please go ahead and download it.

For those of you who are getting a tablet computer, like an iPad, I'm not sure whether… is this going to work on… Hi, Pat.

Yeah, so, I think for those of you who are using a tablet computer, I would encourage you to get a mobile computer next week, but, for now, I mean, you can still just kind of tag along and look at what we're doing, and maybe go to some… Go to one of the students with a mobile computer, so you know how things will work, and then you can go home, and with your mobile computer, or go to a computer lab, you should be able to get things done fairly quickly.

So again, going back to the ZIP package, there will be a CSV file, so this is the data, okay?

So, CSV is very similar to spreadsheet, but it's simpler, okay?

So you can think of it as a spreadsheet.

When you open it, it will be a spreadsheet, okay?

And then there will be another fire, it's the Jupyter Notebook.

Now, Jupyter Notebook, you would consider this as some codes, okay?

And, this is a file that you can write some codes, and the codes can be run.

right there, okay?

So, there will be, You know, of course, behind the scenes, there will be some other program running.

And then there will be… yeah, I think that's mainly the two files.

And in order to run the Jupyter Notebook, you can't just open the Jupyter Notebook, like, on your Word or Notepad or anything, so you have to install a software It's called, VS Code.

But, there will be more instruction that the Talia will provide you.

So, do you want to go down a bit?

So again, what we're trying to do today is to introduce some analytical tools including GitHub, Copiler that can help you write the codes, alright?

Because, you know.

I don't think we can run this course without AI, basically.

If we talk about, like, two years ago, like, even one year ago, AI is not really that good at programming or writing program calls.

We can't really run this course, you know, or we can only run this course for students who have already done some programming.

But now with AI, we can basically teach this course even to students who have zero programming background, okay?

So, yeah, so I think that's kind of the introduction.

Maybe, Tayle, do you want to start getting into the details?

Okay, so good morning, everyone.

In the zip file you downloaded, actually there is a PDF file, which contains, some of the content shows here in this, like, interactive Panel.

So this is the slides that I made for this relative technical part of today's course.

So it's called Data Visualization with GitHub Copilot.

I will skip this recap.

And only mention that this will be part of the analytical tools for our data-informed policymaking in Hong Kong.

So in today's task, we will focus on data visualization, and first of all, I would like to give you a context of the problem, or the data that we will visualize.

So, I do not want to, do the data visualization for visualization, so hopefully this will be a, Comprehensive context for the visualization task.

So if you click the link, here on this PDF.

It will lead you to this… questionnaire.

About this, people's… this is the, survey.

for the, Hong Kong, Manipet.

Municipal solid waste charging policies of it.

So I think most of you have heard about this policy, right?

So last year, finally, it is postponed again, so it is not implemented.

And actually, there is a very long story for this policy.

Because at the very beginning, it can date back to 2005.

I think it's when… about the time that you were born… you were born.

See, around 20 years ago, Hong Kong government.

Published this policy framework for municipal solid waste management.

So even 20 years ago, this policy framework was already published.

But after 20 years, this policy is still not implemented, due to many, Practical issues, and also very, also many controversials.

So here, this study focused on some potential influencing factors of this, of the level of support for this policy.

So here shows the description.

The aim of this survey is to understand Hong Kong residents' awareness attitudes.

And daily waste management behaviors related to this waste charging policy.

So that's the overall aim of the survey.

And later, we will look at the data that's collected based on this survey, and do the data visualization for specific questions.

So this questionnaire is divided into four sections.

First, the assessment of the policy support.

So this is, like, the, our response variable.

Because we want to explore the potential influencing factors of the level of support to this policy.

So we want to know what kind of factors will, affect, for example, the following exploratory variables, like the household waste disposal and recycling habits.

Say, whether the, household who, which deposed a lot of garbages will tend to, To be more against this policy.

Because overall, the policy says that the more waste The household produce, or the, say, the restaurant owners produce.

The higher amount of money they should pay.

The polluter pay principle.

So maybe, the level of support to this policy may have certain relationship with the amount of waste disposal.

Or… The recycling habits may also affect the level of support.

Say, for those who have already, get used to recycled waste.

They may have a higher recycling frequency, or they pay more effort on recycling items.

Then if that is the case, it is likely that the level of support for this policy will be higher.

So these are the, potential influencing factors, Of this level of support for this policy.

Similarly, the demographic information, for example, maybe the level of education will also affect their level of support.

or the age.

They, with, more senior people may tend to, more against this policy, so these are all potential factors that will influence the level of The policy support.

So then, let's dive into, how these questions are set in this questionnaire.

So the first section is this assessment of policy support.

So before asking the, questions.

Firstly, here shows a very brief introduction to this municipal solid waste charging policy.

So it's based on this polluter pace principle.

And requiring all household and non-household pharmacists in Hong Kong to pay according to the quality of waste disposed.

So the more waste disposed, the higher the cost of purchasing designated bags or tags.

So that's the principle.

And the purpose is to reduce the amount of waste and promote the recycling behavior.

And here also shows some basic information.

Like, according to the Environmental Protection Department's estimate.

3 to 4 person households using one 10L, or 15L designated garbage bag per day.

Would incur a monthly waste charging fee of approximately $30 to $53.

So that's the basic background information of what this policy is.

So then we can go to the questions.

So, first of all, this is the key, measurement, we focus.

To how much extent the respondents support this policy?

And starting from the second question to the fifth question, it's actually the, preserved, like, fairness or preserved responsiveness to public opinion from different, measuring the attitude of the respondents from different, aspects.

For example, for this second question, according to the polluter-pays Principle.

Do you think charging by the amount of garbage can fairly Reflect the environmental burden of different families.

So this question measure the perceived fairness of this policy.

And I think it's reasonable to assume that if people tend to believe that this policy is fair.

Then, it's likely that They will support, they will, like, more support this policy.

So this is one possible influencing factor.

Another perspective is, Do you think the government has fully considered the opinions Of citizens from different social classes.

When formulating this garbage charging policy.

So this is another aspect.

It's the responsiveness to the public opinion when making this policy.

So… I think, again, it's very likely that if the respondents believe that the government has fully considered the opinions of citizens, then it's likely that they will support this policy.

And another possible perspective is.

How helpful do you think the waste charging policy will be in reducing the total waste volume?

So this question measures the helpfulness, or perceived helpfulness, of this policy.

to… To reduce the total waste volume.

So, if the, respondents believe that this policy is helpful.

To reduce the waste, then it is likely that there will support for this policy.

And the last question in this section is, how severe do you think Hong Kong's current waste management issues are?

So this measures the perceived severity of the waste management situation in Hong Kong.

So, supposedly, if the respondents feel that the waste management issue in Hong Kong is already severe enough, then it's likely that they will support this policy.

Sorry to interrupt, I don't know.

Because we have a couple of students just join us.

Just want to make sure that we're on the same page.

If you can go to our Week 2 notes in Moodle.

And then, I actually replied.

To share a, maybe I have to refresh.

Just refresh.

So, there's actually a link to the Google Form, right?

So, so you should be able to access, you only take a quick look.

The idea is that, as we explained earlier, today we're going to teach you how to use some… writing some Python codes to analyze the data, right?

But for illustration purpose, we need to have some data to write the code, and the codes can… Perform, you know, can take the data as input, and then there will be output, which would become the charts and graphs and everything.

All right, so now what Dr.

Wu is doing is to explain the context, right?

So we know what the data looks like.

If you want to look at the data, you can just go to that download zip file… the zip file, go to that folder, you will find a CSV.

Okay?

So the CSV file is the… the data, is the responses to that questionnaire.

Okay?

The whole journey would be, you want to do some project, you want to do some research, you want to gauge the people's opinions, so you run a questionnaire.

All right, so when people fill in the questionnaire, they will become, like, a CSV file.

There's data, you know, quantitative data.

And you can't just make sense of data, right?

It's all just numbers, you know, rows and cells.

So we have to write a program that can do the kind of tedious work.

to turn the data into something that makes more sense to humans, which is graphs and charts and everything.

So that's what we're trying to do today, okay?

I hope that makes sense.

And again, if you are on a tablet computer, like an iPad, you can just probably listen a little bit, get to know what's going on, and when you go home, you can run the code very quickly on your own computer, right?

Thanks.

Okay.

So later in the CSV file, you will see the, support info.

So that question refers to this first question, and you will see that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which represents for different options.

Because this type of questions is, has an ordinal sense, so it… starts from the strongly opposed to strongly support.

So this contains the order in these options, so it is reasonable to use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to code these options.

That's the reason later in the CSV file, you did not… you will not see the… the exact wordings, like, strongly oppose, oppose.

Instead, you will see numbers, like, from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Okay.

And… So for this study, you can actually observe that it measures Or it explores the potential influencing factors of the level of support from a conceptual perspective.

So, people preserve the fairness, or perceived the responsiveness to the public opinion.

These are all from the conceptual perspective.

Rather than a practical perspective.

So during the discussion for this, whether we should really implement this policy.

There are actually many, practical controversials.

Like, I think one of the most commonly seen discussion or mentioned difficulty of implementing this policy is about the number of recycling facilities in community is not enough.

Right?

Because… If the recycling facility are not enough, then… Even if people want to reduce the waste, want to do recycle, then there's no enough support.

I'm not sure whether you have observed this, you want to recycle some items, and you bring them to the recycle bin, but it turns out that the recycle bin is already full.

So these may imply that the overall, either the amount of the recycling facilities is not enough.

Or, the manpower to, timely empty those bins is not enough.

But then the question is, do we have such data?

Do we have such data to measure?

The existing utility rate for the recycling facilities.

So suppose if we have such data, say we found that only 30% of the existing recycling bins are used.

The utility rate is really low.

Then this would not be a controversial anymore, because Data shows us that.

There's enough facility.

Then the focus of the government should be to promote or to encourage people to do the recycling.

Right.

Then this is… the… the facility itself is not an issue.

But if it turns out that data shows that 90% of the facility is used.

Or even sometimes is overused.

Then the resources need to be put in either to increase the amount of recycling facilities, or to the manpower to timely empty those existing recycling bins.

So this, decision will be, will be based on the data, and whether we have such data, whether the government has collected such data, whether we can access such kind of data.

So these might be the problems that we… we can try to, inquire those officers, or try to… try to find on the internet, try to… try to search for.

And even when we step back, thinking of At the planning stage of putting those recycling facilities in the community.

How exactly did the government make the decision?

Say we have 18 districts in Hong Kong.

With different number of population, with different demographic features.

And when those recycling facilities were put Or were planned to put in different districts.

What kind of information is used to make such decision?

Do they consider the population?

Do they consider the average age of the resident in that area?

Or do they even consider the education level?

What kind of factors do they consider when they make the decision to put certain amount of facilities in those communities?

So that will be… that will be, another question that, I think you can think of.

And if we go one step further, To what extent?

The recycling for citizens is enough.

So how can the government set the evaluation mechanisms to dynamically evaluate the usage of these facilities?

I think this is also a question that we can't think of.

When we… when we consider about the level of support for the policy from the practical perspective.

So for this specific questionnaire, it focused on the influencing factors of level of support, From the conceptual level.

And maybe later in your group project, you may consider this problem from a more practical perspective.

Okay, so this is the first section.

And for the second section, it's about the household waste disposal and recycling habits.

So the number of bags, The household dispose of daily.

And the frequency of the recycling behavior.

The time and effort that is typically taken to recycle the items.

And the last question is whether you have seen this food waste recycling bins.

So, as mentioned, these are all potential influencing factors of the level of support.

Oh, except for this fourth question.

This is just a… Like a, collecting information about the, The scene frequency of this waste… food waste recycle bin.

And if the respondents had seen this food waste recycling bin before.

Then, the next question will be asked is, have you ever used the food waste recycling bins?

Okay, the third part is about the, some, some knowledge of the recycling.

I think the assumption behind these three questions is If the person really cares about the environment, or… He has much knowledge about the recycling, then possibly they will have a higher support level for the waste charging policy.

I will quickly fill some… options here.

So these are, overall, this section tests the knowledge.

And… The fourth section is actually a re-evaluation of the policy support.

So here, the designer of this questionnaire Shows two pieces of information regarding this policy.

And see whether this information will affect The level of support for the respondents.

So the four… first key information is that, actually, Hong Kong's landfills are nearing capacity.

So it says, based on the current daily waste intake, both landfills are projected to reach full capacity by next year.

So this works like a warning.

Like, the severity of Hong Kong's waste management is actually quite high.

It's very severe now.

We're facing this situation.

And the second piece of information shows a successful case of a nearby country, the South Korean.

Which implemented this waste charging policy in 1995, And it turns out that after, over… 30 years.

The, recycling rate has reached 60%.

So the designer would like to test whether receiving these two pieces of information Made to some extent.

change.

The level of support of the respondents.

So, if it turns out that this kind of, information might be helpful to improve.

The level of support, then maybe later in promotion of such policy, we may use the same strategy.

So later, you will, really, visualize the data, so before the showing up of these two pieces of information, naturally, what is, on average, the, support rate.

For this policy.

And then there's another, variable, which captures the level of supportness after.

The respondents received this information.

And hopefully you… you will be curious about whether there's any change.

Of the support nets after showing this information.

And the last section is the demographic information.

These are quite, commonly seen?

Are you a permanent resident?

What is the highest education level?

Household size?

Which districts you leave.

What's the type of housing do you leave, and age, interval, and also the household monthly income range, something like that.

So again, these are all potential influencing factors.

To the level of support for this, garbage charging policy.

So this is the overall structure of this questionnaire.

And as mentioned, today, the focus is to do visualization.

To really test the association between this potential influencing factors.

to the response, we will put this… we have to use certain model, as mentioned, the regression model, to capture their relationships.

But that will be the focus of our case study.

For today, we will use the questions in this questionnaire to do the data visualization.

So later, I think… I'm not sure how many of you have installed VS Code.

Do you mind raising your hand?

Not many.

I think during the break, you can still do it.

Just follow the reference book, which I screenshot yesterday, sent you by email.

So, from there, we can, download the… this is the code editor, which is called VS Code, that we will use to write, write Python code.

So here shows the interface of this VS Code.

because there are, I would say, many panels in this interface, so I think it's still useful to briefly talk about the structures.

Overall, on the left-hand side, here is the activity bar.

The most, commonly used one should be this, so you see these blocks?

So this shows the extensions you need to install to open the Jupyter Notebook file we provided.

And… Next to it is a sidebar.

Which shows the folder you opened, and the scripts, or the notebook files in the directory.

And for these editor panels, we basically type our code.

Here, so this is the, editing, panel.

And if we want to run the code, actually for Jupyter Notebook, this run button is not here, but just next to the code, on the left-hand side.

So after you install it, you will see that small button.

And for the bottom panel, it's called the output and terminal panel.

And I think at the very beginning stage, we don't even have to open this panel.

And here contains a co-pilot symbol.

So if it looks like this, it means that your AI programming assistant is there for you.

So as long as you, install the, AI co- sorry, the GitHub Copilot extension, you will be able to see this… this icon.

So this is the VS Code interface.

And what we will use, To write code, it's called the Egyptian Notebook.

So this notebook is an interactive tool that lets you write and run codes View results immediately, and also add notes.

So here shows the interface of a web version of Jupyter Notebook, so we will use a local version.

But here shows the, a web version.

Basically, there are, two types of cells.

So as a cell, I mean, cell.

So for this type of cell, it's, cold cell.

Where we input our code.

And there are also a type of, cell called markdown, where we can add the notes.

the reason we choose to use Jupyter Notebook is that The, results of the code can be immediately shown up just right, after the code, so it's quite, friendly.

Say I have many code for my visualization, and after I run it.

Then the corresponding figures will… will be… show up immediately.

op… Below this, code cell.

And here shows the, specific, instruction, but I think this part is, needed after you install the, the VS Code, Python.

So maybe I skip this for, At this moment.

And I think maybe later we have the break first, and during this break, as mentioned, you could, go ahead to download Python VS Code, and also install the relevant extension from here.

And then we will go to this, this scene.

So, I think after the break, I will continue from… from here.

Alright, so let's take a short break, and if you have any questions about the setup, you can reply to our Week 2 notes.

And I will be monitoring, you know, any reply, but of course, you know, you can raise your hand.

I mean, for people who are watching the video, or, you know, you need any help.

And starting from next week, once we, after the Agile period, I'm going to set up a WhatsApp group.

So you guys can join the group, and we can have further discussion, alright?

Right, so there's a little bit of technical details here, so I hope you can be patient if this is new to you.

I think, all this, software and interface has been designed to be human-friendly.

Alright, so there's actually a lot of codes and a lot of magic running behind the scenes.

So when we write a program with AI assistance, there's different levels of abstraction that we can decide, you know.

At the highest level, you can treat all this as black box.

In other words, all you care about is the input and output.

What happened in between?

You don't really have to… have to worry much about.

And I think that's probably good enough for students taking this course, especially those with no programming background.

You just follow the instruction, and you need to do a bit copy and pasting, you send the instruction to AI, the AI will generate codes, you copy and paste back to the Jupyter Notebook VS Code, and it will run.

Alright, if it doesn't run, there may be some errors, there's some warning, you copy those errors and warning to AI again, and AI will tell you what to do, and you do it.

Okay, and why do you want to do that?

And how the codes actually work?

You don't have to worry about that at this stage.

I mean, at some point, if you feel like you want to learn more, you want to become a more advanced learner of programming, then you can look into the codes.

You can figure out, oh, actually, this code is calling this function, that code is taking some data from somewhere, and, you know, there's all the details you can learn.

But at this stage, for our purpose, for our cause.

you don't have to worry about all those technical details.

So I hope that can give you kind of a peace of mind, you know, in terms of if you are from a non-programming background.

But at the same time, I also hope this experience would give you the opportunity to actually open the door for you, right?

So maybe later on in your work, in your life, there's some other problems that need programming to help.

then it can help, you see what I mean?

So the next time when people talk to you about VS Code, Python, or Jupyter Notebook, it's not just all, like, a foreign language or Greek to you, you see what I mean?

So I think that's really important.

So I think, you know, I don't want to preach, but I think it's really important to Get out of our comfort zone and try new things, right?

Let's take a short break, and we'll come back to do the hands-on thing.

Let's check the progress.

Raise your hand if you already got your VS Code installed on your computer.

That seems to be a very important step.

Raise your hand.

Okay?

Now, raise your hand if you got that zip file downloaded from Moodle.

and, open it on unzipit, Yeah?

Okay?

Now, what you need to do, if you haven't done, is to go to VS Code and open that folder.

Where you, you unzip the zip file from.

Okay?

Because once you download the zip file, it must be somewhere, right?

It could be on your desktop, it could be one of the folders.

for the… for the course, you probably have a folder for this course.

So, you unzip that file into your course folder, so there will be a folder for this specific, activity.

And in that folder, you should find a, one CSV, one file.

end with CSV, that's the data file.

Another file that ends with IP… IP… Why something?

Which is a Jupyter Notebook.

And then there's another, I think it's a PDF or something.

So basically, you… you have to use VS Code to open That folder.

And, on the left-hand side, you will see a panel where you can see the folder, alright?

And, and also the files.

Now, once you are at that stage, you are in business, okay?

So you can open the Jupyter Notebook file.

In the VS Code.

So you can start doing the coding.

Alright?

Now, I mean, if you are a good programmer, you're an experienced programmer, you can even just write the code by yourself.

You don't need AI.

But for beginners.

then you can get some help from AI.

So how do you get help from AI?

Well.

you can actually go to Poe, you can go to Grok, go to DeepSeek.

you can do that as well.

But the Copilot is more integrated, right?

So that's why you want to start using Copilot.

Now, in VS Code, you need to install an extension called GitHub Copilot.

So you can access Copilot.

That's your friend, okay?

It can help you solve all the problems related to programming for this course, so make sure that you install the extension GitHub Copilot.

We do need to register, right?

Sign up for a GitHub account, do we?

Okay, so once you, Once you have your extension of the GitHub compiler ready.

when you try to fire it up and start using Copilot, then Copilot would ask you to log in to GitHub, right, because it's a GitHub service.

So then, this is a very important moment now, okay?

Once you join the GitHub, you join a community of programmers.

Alright?

So, and, next time when you talk to people, you say, I have a GitHub account, alright?

That's something you should be proud of.

And you can start making friends on GitHub.

There's so many very interesting open source, projects and things that's going on in GitHub.

Right?

So maybe you are running into some really interesting project, and you can… you can, right, do a… a build-up, do a follow-up on that project, you see.

GitHub is a… is an amazing community, okay?

And now, once, once you're on GitHub.

Once you have the account, you should have access to Copilot.

All right?

And at some point, you may want to, apply for the GitHub education.

Because you are a university student, you are entitled to the education benefits of GitHub, so you can do that later.

Because for this particular project, the free account should give you all the resources, all the tokens, and everything you need.

Okay, so you don't have to worry.

So I think we have kind of just explained to you how you can reach the stage, you have a co-pilot next to you to start writing codes.

If you have… need some help to get to that step.

just let us know, okay?

So, we want to make sure that everybody is on the same page, everybody can have access to compiler.

You know, you need to install VS Code, open the folder.

install the GitHub Copilot extension, apply… join the GitHub, get a GitHub account.

Login, and you're… then we're in business, okay?

It's better to have, maybe I'll share my screen, too, so I can… Wait, that's selfish.

Oh, no.

Oh, the But we also need to watch it.

Oh, gosh.

So, for those of you who, Need some help, you can look at the screen here.

So, of course, I'm using Mac.

If you are using a window space, it's a little bit different.

So basically, what, what you can do is… go to… code, right?

Go to VS Code.

And, VS Code is actually just called Code.

Let me see if I can make it a bit bigger.

Alright, so, you are in… you are in VS Code, you will be able to see codes here.

You just open the folder, right?

So you open the folder.

And it is the folder where you have unzipped.

the zip file we provided is called Week 2 Data Visualization GitHub Compiler.

Now, you open it.

And once you open it, You can see there's, 3 files, One is the CSV, The week 2 CSV, that's the… that's the spreadsheet, okay?

That's all the… all the data we got from the questionnaire.

And there's also the PDF, So the PDF is the slides that, Dr.

Wu just, presented?

And then there's the IPYMB, the extension.

So this is the… Jupy the notebook.

Where you want to, work on.

So, I hope you are here.

Now, once you are here, Then you want to, open up The sidebar, so there's a side window here, that's the, Co-pilot.

That's the GitHub copiler.

Now, in order to… fire up this GitHub compiler thing, you will have to install the extension.

So where do you install an extension?

You come here.

Oh, sorry.

Right, so, so, so you come here, you see there's, 3 square, and one, also square, but, move… rotate a little bit.

So that's the extension, right?

So it's like, extension is like a piece of puzzle added to your… to your picture, right?

So, there's many extensions.

And you need to find an extension which is… the, GitHub Copilot, okay?

And once you install it, you can open up here, and you can start Get some help from… from Copilot.

Now, in Copilot, there are 3 options.

There's Agent, there's Ask, there's Edit.

The agent mode is more advanced.

It's a very recent, feature.

So, I would encourage you to go for Ask.

Because Agent Mode can be a bit confusing for beginners, so let's… let's worry about… let's try Agent Mode later.

Agent mode is actually very… it's, it's, it's amazing, you know, HMO is amazing.

But for beginners, let's, let's start with the ask mode, because you will have more control.

HMO is like, they will take over.

the HMO will take over and do everything for you.

All you have to do, just continue, continue, and they will do everything for you.

But for our purpose, let's still do a little bit of copy and paste, all right?

So I hope this has helped you a bit more, but do raise your hand, you have questions.

You know, if you have no idea what's going on, that's… that's normal, okay?

Don't… don't worry, that's normal.

Just… just raise your hand, and we'll help you.

And for the computer science majors, do you want to stand up so you can get… you can offer some help?

Alright, anyone needs help?

Yeah.

So if… if there's a need to run something like a PEEP, or, you know, those are what we call command line.

I would recommend you to go to the… VS Code, because VS Code has got its own command line, right?

So if you go to the… top right corner, You see there's this icon, this… This button here.

That's how you open the command line.

Open the terminal, okay?

So you need to learn how to open the terminal, and then you can start running some command.
