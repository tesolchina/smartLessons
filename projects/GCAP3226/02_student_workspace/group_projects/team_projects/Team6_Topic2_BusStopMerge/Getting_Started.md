# Bus Stop Merger Analysis - Getting Started Guide

## Project Overview
This project examines whether merging bus stops that are very close together (specifically, two stops only 25 meters apart) improves or hinders public transport efficiency and accessibility.

## Background Context
- **Current Situation**: Multiple bus stops in close proximity may cause inefficiencies
- **Specific Case**: Two bus stops 25 meters apart (location to be identified)
- **Previous Work**: Some preliminary analysis has been completed
- **Policy Impact**: Could influence citywide bus stop planning

## Key Research Questions
1. What is the optimal distance between consecutive bus stops?
2. How does stop merger affect passenger accessibility and walking distances?
3. What are the operational cost implications of merging stops?
4. How do different user groups (elderly, disabled, families) respond to stop changes?

## Data Sources & Availability
### Primary Sources
- **Bus Stop Locations**: GPS coordinates and spacing data
- **Ridership Data**: Passenger counts at affected stops
- **Accessibility Data**: Walking distance analysis for different user groups

### Secondary Sources
- **Previous Research**: Review existing preliminary work
- **International Examples**: Best practices from other cities
- **Cost Data**: Operational savings from stop consolidation

## Methodology Framework
### Phase 1: Baseline Analysis
- Map current stop locations and usage patterns
- Analyze ridership at both stops
- Document accessibility concerns

### Phase 2: Impact Modeling
- Walking distance analysis for affected passengers
- Accessibility impact assessment
- Cost-benefit modeling

### Phase 3: Recommendation Development
- Merger decision framework
- Implementation guidelines
- Monitoring and evaluation plan

## Technical Tools
- **GIS Analysis**: Mapping and distance calculations
- **Statistical Analysis**: Ridership pattern analysis
- **Accessibility Modeling**: Walking distance and barrier analysis

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Baseline Report**: Current state analysis of the two stops
2. **Impact Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of merger effects
3. **Decision Framework**: Criteria for future stop merger decisions
4. **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step merger process

## Getting Started Steps
1. **Week 1**: Identify and visit the specific bus stops (25m apart)
2. **Week 2**: Review previous work and collect baseline ridership data
3. **Week 3**: Conduct accessibility analysis and user surveys
4. **Week 4**: Develop analytical framework and begin impact modeling

## Key Considerations
### Benefits of Merging
- Reduced operational costs
- Improved traffic flow
- Simplified route planning

### Potential Drawbacks
- Increased walking distances for some users
- Accessibility challenges for elderly/disabled
- Possible overcrowding at remaining stop

## Success Criteria
- Clear recommendation on whether to merge the specific stops
- Generalizable framework for future merger decisions
- Evidence-based analysis of accessibility impacts
- Stakeholder consultation and feedback integration

## Contact & Resources
- **Field Work**: Visit stops during peak/off-peak hours
- **Data Sources**: Transport Department, bus operators
- **Previous Work**: Review existing analysis (to be provided)
