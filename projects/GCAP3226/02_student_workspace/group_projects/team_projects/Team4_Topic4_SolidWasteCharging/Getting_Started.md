# Solid Waste Charging Scheme - Getting Started Guide

## Project Overview
This project continues and expands upon previous questionnaire research on Hong Kong's solid waste charging scheme, focusing on effectiveness evaluation and behavioral impact analysis.

## Background Context
- **Policy**: Municipal solid waste charging scheme implementation
- **Previous Work**: Questionnaire survey already completed
- **Current Status**: Ready for team continuation and expansion
- **Policy Relevance**: Critical environmental and economic policy

## Key Research Questions
1. How effective is the solid waste charging scheme in reducing waste generation?
2. What behavioral changes has the scheme induced in different populations?
3. What are the economic impacts on households and businesses?
4. How can the scheme be optimized for better outcomes?

## Data Sources & Availability
### Existing Data
- **Completed Questionnaire**: Results from previous survey work
- **Implementation Data**: Government scheme performance metrics
- **Waste Statistics**: Before/after waste generation data

### Additional Data Opportunities
- **Comparative Analysis**: Other cities' charging schemes
- **Behavioral Studies**: Follow-up surveys and interviews
- **Economic Impact**: Cost-benefit analysis data

## Methodology Framework
### Phase 1: Existing Data Analysis
- Review completed questionnaire results
- Analyze government implementation data
- Identify data gaps and research opportunities

### Phase 2: Expanded Research
- Design follow-up surveys or interviews
- Collect comparative data from other jurisdictions
- Conduct economic impact analysis

### Phase 3: Policy Recommendations
- Evaluate scheme effectiveness
- Propose optimization strategies
- Develop implementation improvements

## Technical Tools
- **Survey Analysis**: Statistical analysis of questionnaire data
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Analysis of waste generation changes
- **Economic Analysis**: Cost-benefit and impact assessment

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Baseline Report**: Analysis of existing questionnaire and implementation data
2. **Effectiveness Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of scheme impacts
3. **Behavioral Analysis**: Understanding of population responses
4. **Policy Recommendations**: Optimization strategies for the charging scheme

## Getting Started Steps
1. **Week 1**: Review existing questionnaire data and methodology
2. **Week 2**: Collect government implementation statistics and reports
3. **Week 3**: Design expanded research approach
4. **Week 4**: Begin data collection and analysis
