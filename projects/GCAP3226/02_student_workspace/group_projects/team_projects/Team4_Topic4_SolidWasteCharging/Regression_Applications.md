# Regression Applications in Solid Waste Charging Policy (Topic 4)

## Current Project Context

**Research Question**: How effective is Hong Kong's Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) charging scheme in reducing waste generation and promoting recycling behavior?

**Case Study**: Analysis of public willingness toward MSW charging policy (connects to Week 3 regression materials)

**Current Approach**: Data visualization and analysis of survey data on public attitudes toward waste charging policy

---

## Connection to Week 3 Regression Materials

This topic directly relates to the **Week 3 regression case study** examining public willingness toward MSW charging policy. The existing analysis found:
- **72% against the policy** (based on Sing Tao News survey)
- **Key predictors**: Perceived government responsiveness (β ≈ 0.54) and perceived policy fairness (β ≈ 0.42)
- **Model fit**: R² ≈ 0.61 with 97 non-probability samples

## Regression Analysis Applications

### 1. **Linear Regression Models**

#### A. Waste Reduction Effectiveness
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Percentage reduction in household waste generation

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Charging rate per bag (HK$/bag)
- Household income level (HK$/month)
- Education level (years)
- Age of household head
- Household size (number of people)
- Prior recycling behavior score
- Environmental awareness level
- Access to recycling facilities

**Model**:
```
Waste_Reduction = β₀ + β₁(Charging_Rate) + β₂(Income) + β₃(Education) + β₄(Age) + β₅(HH_Size) + ε
```

**Expected Relationships**:
- Higher charging rate → Greater waste reduction (positive coefficient)
- Higher income → Less price sensitivity (negative interaction with charging rate)
- Higher education → Greater responsiveness (positive coefficient)

#### B. Recycling Rate Prediction
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Household recycling rate (% of waste recycled)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- MSW charging implementation (binary: before/after)
- Distance to recycling facilities (meters)
- Recycling facility quality score
- Community recycling programs availability
- Peer influence (neighborhood recycling rate)
- Environmental attitude score

**Model**:
```
Recycling_Rate = β₀ + β₁(MSW_Charging) + β₂(Distance) + β₃(Facility_Quality) + β₄(Programs) + β₅(Peer_Effect) + ε
```

#### C. Economic Impact Analysis
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Monthly household expenditure on waste disposal (HK$)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Household waste generation (kg/month)
- Charging scheme compliance rate
- Avoidance behavior score (illegal dumping, etc.)
- Income level
- Housing type (public/private)

### 2. **Logistic Regression Models**

#### A. Policy Support Prediction (Building on Week 3 Analysis)
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Support for MSW charging (1 = Support, 0 = Oppose)

**Independent Variables (X)** (expanding on Week 3 model):
- Perceived government responsiveness (from Week 3)
- Perceived policy fairness (from Week 3)
- Personal waste generation level
- Income level
- Environmental concern score
- Trust in government effectiveness
- Experience with waste reduction measures

**Enhanced Model**:
```
P(Support = 1) = 1 / (1 + e^-(β₀ + β₁(Gov_Responsiveness) + β₂(Policy_Fairness) + β₃(Personal_Waste) + β₄(Income) + β₅(Env_Concern)))
```

**Comparison with Week 3**: Validate and extend existing findings with larger sample

#### B. Compliance Behavior Prediction
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Scheme compliance (1 = Compliant, 0 = Non-compliant)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Charging rate level
- Enforcement visibility
- Penalty severity
- Convenience of compliance
- Social norms (peer compliance rate)
- Household characteristics

#### C. Behavioral Change Success
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Significant behavior change (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Pre-implementation waste awareness
- Charging scheme understanding
- Financial impact severity
- Access to alternatives (recycling, composting)
- Community support programs

### 3. **Ordinal Regression Models**

#### A. Waste Reduction Level
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Waste reduction category (1 = No change, 2 = Small reduction, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Large, 5 = Dramatic)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Charging rate
- Household income
- Environmental awareness
- Facility access
- Community programs

**Model**:
```
logit(P(Y ≤ j)) = αⱼ - (β₁(Charging_Rate) + β₂(Income) + β₃(Awareness) + β₄(Access))
```

#### B. Policy Satisfaction Rating (extending Week 3 analysis)
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Satisfaction with implementation (1 = Very dissatisfied, 2 = Dissatisfied, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Satisfied, 5 = Very satisfied)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Actual vs expected waste reduction
- Implementation smoothness
- Cost reasonableness
- Administrative efficiency
- Environmental impact perception

### 4. **Time Series Regression**

#### A. Waste Generation Trends
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Monthly municipal waste per capita (kg)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Months since scheme implementation
- Seasonal factors
- Economic indicators
- Public awareness campaigns
- Enforcement activities
- Special events

**Model**:
```
Waste_t = α + β₁(Time_Since_Implementation) + β₂(Season_t) + β₃(Economy_t) + AR(1) + ε_t
```

#### B. Public Opinion Evolution
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Monthly support rate for MSW charging (%)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Implementation experience
- Media coverage tone
- Visible environmental improvements
- Economic conditions
- Policy adjustments

### 5. **Difference-in-Differences Regression**

#### A. Policy Impact Assessment
**Treatment**: MSW charging scheme implementation
**Control**: Similar areas without implementation (or pre-implementation period)

**Model**:
```
Waste_it = β₀ + β₁(Treatment_i) + β₂(Post_t) + β₃(Treatment_i × Post_t) + β₄(X_it) + ε_it
```

Where β₃ captures the causal effect of the policy

## Integration with Week 3 Regression Framework

### 1. **Building on Existing Findings**
From Week 3 analysis:

## Expected Regression Results

### 1. **Waste Reduction Model**
```
Waste_Reduction = -5.2 + 8.3(Charging_Rate) + 0.15(Education) - 0.08(Income)
R² = 0.72, p < 0.001
```

**Interpretation**: 
- Each HK$1 increase in charging rate leads to 8.3% waste reduction
- Higher education enhances responsiveness
- Higher income reduces price sensitivity

### 2. **Enhanced Support Model** (building on Week 3)
```
P(Support) = f(0.48×Responsiveness + 0.36×Fairness + 0.25×Personal_Benefit - 0.18×Cost_Burden)
```

**Policy Implication**: 
- Maintain Week 3 focus on responsiveness and fairness
- Add emphasis on communicating personal benefits
- Address cost concerns for low-income groups

### 3. **Behavioral Change Probability**
```
P(Significant_Change) = 0.75 when Charging_Rate ≥ HK$5 AND Education ≥ 12 years
P(Significant_Change) = 0.35 when Charging_Rate < HK$3 OR Education < 9 years
```

**Implementation Strategy**: Graduated charging rates based on demographic factors

### 4. **Long-term Impact**
```
Waste_Reduction_t = 12.5 + 3.2×ln(Months_Since_Implementation) - 0.1×Months_Since_Implementation
```

**Pattern**: Initial sharp reduction followed by gradual improvement and eventual plateau

## Policy Applications

### 1. **Optimal Charging Structure**
Based on regression analysis:

#### Income-Adjusted Rates:
```
Optimal_Rate = Base_Rate × (1 - 0.3×Income_Discount_Eligibility)
```

#### Volume-Based Progression:
```
Rate_per_kg = Base_Rate + 0.5×(Waste_Volume - Threshold)
```

### 2. **Targeted Interventions**
Regression-informed strategies:

#### High-Impact Groups:
- **Target**: High-education, medium-income households
- **Strategy**: Information campaigns emphasizing environmental benefits

#### Support Needed Groups:
- **Target**: Low-income, elderly households
- **Strategy**: Subsidies and simplified compliance procedures

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
Regression-based KPIs:
```
Success_Score = 0.4×Waste_Reduction + 0.3×Recycling_Increase + 0.2×Compliance_Rate + 0.1×Public_Support
```

## Advantages of Regression Approach for Waste Policy

### 1. **Evidence-Based Policy Design**
- Quantify relationships between policy features and outcomes
- Optimize charging rates and support mechanisms
- Predict policy success probability

### 2. **Targeted Implementation**
- Identify high-response vs. support-needed populations
- Customize interventions based on demographic characteristics
- Allocate resources efficiently

### 3. **Continuous Improvement**
