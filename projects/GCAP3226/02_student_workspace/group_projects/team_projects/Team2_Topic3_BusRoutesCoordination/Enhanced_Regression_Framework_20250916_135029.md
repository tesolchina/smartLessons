I'll help create a comprehensive revision addressing all feedback points while maintaining practical applicability. Let me structure this systematically.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The regression analysis framework for bus route coordination has been substantially enhanced to address key methodological concerns while maintaining its practical utility. Major improvements include:

1. **Enhanced Statistical Rigor**
- Added robust endogeneity controls through instrumental variables
- Implemented panel data methods with fixed effects
- Introduced non-linear specifications and interaction terms

2. **Strengthened Implementation Framework**
- Developed phased deployment strategy
- Added detailed data collection protocols
- Created comprehensive validation procedures

3. **Improved Policy Integration**
- Enhanced connection between statistical findings and operational decisions
- Added cost-benefit analysis framework
- Incorporated equity considerations

## DETAILED REVISION LOG

### Methodology Improvements

**CHANGE:** [Linear Regression] - Added panel data structure with fixed effects
**RATIONALE:** Address unobserved heterogeneity across stops and routes
**IMPACT:** More reliable estimates controlling for stop-specific characteristics

```python
# Original:
Wait_Time = β₀ + β₁(Service_Gap) + β₂(Combined_Frequency) + β₃(Peak_Hour) + ε

# Revised:
Wait_Time_it = αi + β₁(Service_Gap_it) + β₂(Combined_Frequency_it) + 
               β₃(Service_Gap_it²) + β₄(Peak_Hour_it) + γt + ui + εit
```

**CHANGE:** [Revenue Impact] - Added instrumental variables approach
**RATIONALE:** Address simultaneity between coordination and demand
**IMPACT:** More accurate estimation of causal effects

```python
# First Stage:
Coordination_Level = π₀ + π₁(Weather_Shocks) + π₂(Technical_Disruptions) + controls

# Second Stage:
Revenue = β₀ + β₁(Predicted_Coordination) + controls
```

### Technical Enhancements

**CHANGE:** [All Models] - Added interaction terms and non-linear specifications
**RATIONALE:** Capture complex relationships between variables
**IMPACT:** More accurate modeling of real-world patterns

**CHANGE:** [Validation] - Implemented cross-validation framework
**RATIONALE:** Ensure model robustness and generalizability
**IMPACT:** More reliable predictions and better model selection

### Data Collection Improvements

**CHANGE:** [Sampling] - Added power analysis and sample size calculations
**RATIONALE:** Ensure adequate statistical power
**IMPACT:** More reliable inference and better resource allocation

```python
# Sample Size Calculation
required_n = power_analysis(
    effect_size=0.3,
    power=0.8,
    alpha=0.05,
    predictors=7
)
```
