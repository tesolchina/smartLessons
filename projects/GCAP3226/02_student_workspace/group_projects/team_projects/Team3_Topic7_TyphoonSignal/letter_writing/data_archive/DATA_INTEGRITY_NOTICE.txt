DATA INTEGRITY NOTICE

Updated: 2025-09-08 09:55 HKT

Summary
- Data collected BEFORE 2025-09-08 09:55 HKT may be incorrect due to a parsing artifact that produced near-uniform 9.0 km/h speeds across stations.
- Data collected FROM 2025-09-08 09:55 HKT onward is considered correct after fixing the parser and adding sanity checks.

Affected files in this folder
- hk_wind_log_20250908.csv
- hk_wind_log_20250908_deploy.csv
- collector.log (now includes HEARTBEAT and SUSPICIOUS_DATA entries)

What changed
- Parser now uses csv.reader and targets HKO columns: mean speed = column 9, max gust = column 10 (first language block).
- Added detection for suspicious uniform low values; findings recorded in collector.log.

Guidance
- Treat rows with timestamp earlier than 2025-09-08 09:55 HKT as unreliable for analysis.
- Prefer data at or after 2025-09-08 09:55 HKT for comparisons and reporting.

Contact
- If you need a cleaned export that excludes early rows, generate a filtered CSV using the applicationâ€™s CSV endpoint or contact the maintainer.
