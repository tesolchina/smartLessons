# Regression Applications in Typhoon Signal Policy Analysis (Topic 7)

## Current Project Context

**Research Question**: How accurately do Hong Kong Observatory's typhoon signal decisions reflect actual wind conditions, and how can signal timing be optimized?

**Key Finding**: API analysis of 30 weather stations shows most measurements don't meet No. 8 criteria during signal periods, suggesting potential discrepancies between criteria and practice

**Current Approach**: Real-time wind monitoring system analyzing HKO's public APIs to evaluate signal accuracy

## Regression Analysis Applications

### 1. **Linear Regression Models**

#### A. Signal Accuracy Prediction
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Signal accuracy score (% of time conditions meet signal criteria)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Number of stations meeting criteria
- Average wind speed across all stations
- Maximum wind speed recorded
- Wind direction variability
- Atmospheric pressure
- Typhoon distance from Hong Kong
- Typhoon intensity (category)
- Time since typhoon approach began

**Model**:
```
Accuracy_Score = β₀ + β₁(Stations_Meeting_Criteria) + β₂(Max_Wind_Speed) + β₃(Typhoon_Distance) + ε
```

**Expected Relationships**:
- More stations meeting criteria → Higher accuracy (positive coefficient)
- Closer typhoon distance → Higher accuracy (negative coefficient for distance)

#### B. Economic Impact Estimation
**Dependent Variable (Y)**: Economic cost of signal period (HK$ millions)

**Independent Variables (X)**:
- Signal duration (hours)
- Signal level (T1, T3, T8, T9, T10)
- Day of week (weekday vs weekend)
- Time of day when signal issued
- Business sector affected
- Transportation disruption level
- Tourist season indicator

**Model**:
```
Economic_Cost = β₀ + β₁(Duration) + β₂(Signal_Level) + β₃(Weekday) + β₄(Tourism_Season) + ε
```

### 5. **Spatial Regression**

#### A. Geographic Wind Pattern Analysis
**Account for spatial correlation** between weather stations:

```

Where W is spatial weight matrix capturing geographic relationships

#### B. Regional Signal Impact
**Analyze how signal decisions affect different areas differently**:
- Urban vs rural impact variations
- Economic sector geographic clustering
- Transportation network effects

## Policy Applications of Regression Results

### 1. **Signal Decision Support System**
Based on regression analysis:

#### Real-Time Decision Rules:
```
Signal_Recommendation = f(Stations_Meeting_Criteria, Forecast_Confidence, Safety_Risk, Economic_Impact)

IF: Stations_Meeting ≥ 70% AND Forecast_Confidence ≥ 80%
THEN: Issue signal with high confidence

IF: Stations_Meeting < 50% AND Economic_Impact > HK$500M
THEN: Delay signal pending better data
```

#### Risk Assessment Framework:
```
Decision_Risk = β₁(False_Alarm_Probability) + β₂(Missed_Event_Cost) + β₃(Economic_Disruption) + β₄(Safety_Risk)
```

### 2. **Timing Optimization**
Regression-informed timing strategies:

#### Early Warning Optimization:
```
Optimal_Lead_Time = Base_Time + β₁(Typhoon_Speed) + β₂(Public_Prep_Needs) + β₃(Economic_Factors)
```

#### Signal Duration Prediction:
```
Duration = Base_Duration + β₁(Wind_Persistence) + β₂(Recovery_Needs) + β₃(Safety_Margin)
```

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
```
System_Performance = 0.4×(Accuracy_Rate) + 0.3×(Timing_Appropriateness) + 0.2×(Economic_Efficiency) + 0.1×(Public_Satisfaction)
```

---

## Expected Regression Findings

### 1. **Signal Accuracy Model Results**
```
Accuracy_Score = 45% + 0.8×(Stations_Meeting_Criteria) + 0.3×(Forecast_Confidence) - 0.2×(Economic_Pressure)
R² = 0.74, p < 0.001
```

**Interpretation**: 
- Each 10% increase in stations meeting criteria improves accuracy by 8%
- Economic pressure to avoid disruption reduces accuracy by 20%

### 2. **Optimal Decision Threshold**
```
P(Appropriate_Signal) = 0.90 when Stations_Meeting ≥ 75% AND Distance ≤ 150km
P(Appropriate_Signal) = 0.40 when Stations_Meeting < 50% OR Distance > 300km
```

**Policy Implication**: Require 75% of stations meeting criteria for high-confidence signals

### 3. **Economic Impact Prediction**
```
Economic_Cost = HK$200M + HK$50M×(Signal_Level) + HK$25M×(Duration_Hours) + HK$100M×(Weekday_Indicator)
```

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Balance safety benefits against economic disruption costs

### 4. **False Alarm Risk**
```
P(False_Alarm) = 0.25 when Forecast_Uncertainty > 40% AND Public_Pressure = High
P(False_Alarm) = 0.08 when Forecast_Uncertainty < 20% AND Stations_Meeting > 80%
```

**Risk Management**: Higher thresholds needed during uncertain conditions
