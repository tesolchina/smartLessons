# Bus Frequency Project

## Overview
The decision was about modifying or adjusting the bus frequencies. We'll look at some case studies including 272A a bus running in Simon's neighborhood.

## Status
- Transport Department has already received a request of info from Simon
- Expecting data and info from the TD staff soon

## Research Questions
- How to optimize bus frequencies based on ridership data?
- What factors influence optimal frequency decisions?

## Data Sources
- Transport Department data (pending)
- Case study: Route 272A
- Ridership patterns
- Peak/off-peak analysis

## Next Steps
- Wait for TD response
- Analyze 272A route data
- Develop frequency optimization model
