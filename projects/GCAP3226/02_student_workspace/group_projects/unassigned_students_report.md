## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Fix ZHENG ZIAN's record**: 
   - Add student ID `22231153` to ZHENG ZIAN in Team 3
   - This solves 1 of the 4 unassigned students

2. **Assign remaining 3 students**:
   - **HUNG Chin Ting** → Recommend Team 1, 4, or 6 (have space)
   - **LEUNG Hoi Ying** → Recommend Team 1, 4, or 6 (have space)  
   - **LYU Junhan** → Recommend Team 1, 4, or 6 (have space)

### Suggested Team Assignments:

**Option A: Distribute evenly**
- Team 1 (Topic 6): Add HUNG Chin Ting + LEUNG Hoi Ying (6 total)
- Team 4 (Topic 4): Add LYU Junhan (5 total)
- Team 6 (Topic 2): Keep as 3-person team

**Option B: Balance team sizes**
- Team 1 (Topic 6): Add HUNG Chin Ting (5 total)
- Team 4 (Topic 4): Add LEUNG Hoi Ying (5 total)
- Team 6 (Topic 2): Add LYU Junhan (4 total)

## ⚠️ Additional Issues to Address:

1. **Name Variation**: "TANG Tsz Tung" (enrollment) vs "Tag Tsz Tung" (team list) - same person
2. **Missing Gmail addresses**: 9 students still need Gmail for Google Drive access
3. **WhatsApp group**: Team 1 needs to create their WhatsApp group

**Next Steps**: Contact the 3 unassigned students and assign them to teams with available space.
