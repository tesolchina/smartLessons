**Simon Wang:**

Take a lot of time and effort and try to make it work. And then one of the final crucial steps is to make sure that students will, you know, take this course and will be on board. So that's very challenging, which is why I think we're very happy and grateful that you are here, even though right now we only got 5 students, but I hope more students will join, and also we're recording this, so the first two weeks, you know, if students join later, they can refer to the video.

You know, this course is very unique. In the sense that this is a course co-hosted by Math Department and the Language Center. So, when you think about transdisciplinary, you know, cross-disciplinary collaboration, when the math teacher is working with a language teacher, it's not a very common combination. You know, I taught a GCAP course before, I'm still teaching another GCAP course. It was me with a professor from the English department, so that actually makes more sense, right? Ben and I were both from the language background, but this time, me and Talia, we're from very different backgrounds.

And, but I think these kinds of collaboration are very important, because in the real world, you know, when you try to solve some real-world problem, you can't just rely on one set of tools. Right? Of course, quantitative reasoning is so important these days, right? We're living in the age of big data. We are, you know, embracing AI, and AI is driven by big data. So, quantitative listening technologies are very important, but then at the same time, we also need humanities, we need people who can think more qualitatively, people who can write very well.

So, I think that's where I come to this course, you know. I want to work with my colleague Talia, with a strong quantitative reasoning background. You know, she has a PhD in math and doing a lot of work on applying statistical models to public health. But then I also want to leverage my expertise on working with the government in the past almost 10 years. When I say I work with the government, I'm not really kind of working with them as colleagues. You will see in a minute what do I mean by working with the government. Basically, we are taking the sort of a citizen's role, okay? So we approach the government staff, and we try to ask questions, understand their practices in the public policy. And then we critically review their work. So that's what I mean by working with the government. So that's kind of the background here. So what we're trying to do is to seek some kind of synergy between a math teacher and a language teacher.

Alright, so that's kind of the premise of our course. And, I'd like to invite you to come to this page. Let's see how you can come to this page. Probably the best way to go is to go to Moodle, and in fact, you should get my email, you know, in the calendar, in the Google Calendar, there's also a link. But either way, if you go to Moodle, you will find a Google Docs.

Yeah, so if you go to Moodle, you will find the Google Docs link. So we're going to update this Moodle from time to time throughout the semester, but the best way to access all the materials is actually to come to this page. This is a kind of an unremarkable page here.

We're trying to figure things out, you know, basically this is a new course. This is a great opportunity for us to explore and try different things. So, and we're very happy that we got a pretty small class size so far. You know, we actually have 16 students enrolled, but hopefully more students will join us soon.

At any rate, so if you come to this page, you will see the first link here, which is the course hub. Alright, so this is where I'd like to just give you a little bit more background and what we're trying to do here.

So the course title is Empowering Citizens Through Data, Participatory Policy Analysis for Hong Kong. I think every single word here actually is quite important. So the fundamental motivation here is to empower citizen, all right? Because even though the word citizen implies that we are the taxpayers, we have certain political rights, we are not always feel empowered, right? Because these days, the elite, the government people, you know, the top government officials, they just do whatever they want to do.

So we're trying to empower people. But how do we do that? Well, we do it through data science, okay? That's why we have a mathematician here. Okay, so to be more specific, we try to participate in the policy analysis.

So we analyze policy not just to do research or to write papers, that's usually the normal, you know, the conventional way of doing things in the university is to do research and then publish papers. Get more money, you know? But what we are trying to do here is to engage with the government staff in a more, kind of, close way, and in a more confrontational way, so that we can better understand the current practice of the government, but then try to offer recommendations, try to critically review what the government is trying to do. In the context of data analysis, okay?

So, in terms of course objective, you can see that we are trying to offer a set of analytical tools to enable the so-called data-informed policy-making. Now, data-informed policymaking should be quite straightforward, right? The idea that we want to collect the data, and we want to use data to inform and to make better decisions on public policy. That, that shouldn't be surprising at all.

But the difficulty here is that to what extent… the question here is, to what extent the Hong Kong government staff are doing that. Right? So, to what extent do the Hong Kong government staff actually make decisions based on data? That's the very first question we have to think about. We have to keep in mind.

So I think this is a good opportunity for you to invite some of you to talk. I have one student sitting over there, so maybe… what's your name? And, what do you think about my question?

**Student (Eric):**

My name is Eric.

**Simon Wang:**

Do you answer my question?

**Eric:**

(Irrelevant or unsure answer.)

**Simon Wang:**

So, my question, again, if you don't know my question, do you know my question? Do you know my question?

**Eric:**

No? Okay.

**Simon Wang:**

My question is: To what extent is the Hong Kong government making the decisions based on data. Does it make sense? What do you think?

**Student:**

I think the government should look more about advanced data, like, on the media, or they do research to look around the whole society, to get the advanced data, to implement advanced policy to enhance the efficiency of the entire society.

**Simon Wang:**

Okay, so you are saying that the government should use more data to make decisions, right? Okay, I agree with you. I'm sure that most of you agree, right? The government should. But my question is more like an empirical question. Everybody… we all agree that the government should. But the question is, to what extent they are doing it now? You see what I mean? Thanks.

**Simon Wang:**

What do you think?

**Student:**

I think the government used mandated.

**Simon Wang:**

Yeah.

**Student:**

But… About the decision, I think the data is not the most important part.

**Simon Wang:**

So, when you say the government uses a lot of data, where do you get the information? Where do you get the information?

**Student:**

Every time we have researched the people and environment data.

**Simon Wang:**

So you, you did some research?

**Student:**

Those organizations, they did that, and… I remember refer to the data they gave them, and sometimes, like, some over-budget something. You only used to make? What's your name?

**Student (Bonnie):**

My name is Bonnie, and we see that some of the construction projects are sometimes over budget, but they still do it, because they think that it's good. But I don't think that it's supported by some data, but some… their vision, and yeah, they do use some data, but sometimes, some vision things are not… cannot be analyzed, because there are some future things, and, just their wish. They would like Hong Kong to be like that, and… And, yeah, sometimes it's beneficial to us, because… is addressing some problems, currently, like, some people are poor, they are not… they have not… do not have enough money to buy a house. They would use this data to build some public building and some something, so, yeah, they do use it, but they mixed with some that is not about data.

**Simon Wang:**

Okay, so you refer to the practice of the government, consulting the companies, right? Yeah, they do. Okay.

Well… I think we need to move on, but the short answer to my question "To what extent the government is using the data to make decisions?" The short answer? Is we don't know. Okay? We don't know. Because the government do not tell us. Right? I mean, you can probably look at the newspaper from time to time, there might be some reference to a little bit, like, consulting firms, or there could be some, you know, we do have a… you know, we do have staff, you know, handling data, but to what extent where the government is really using the data to make decisions, we don't know. You see? That's the problem. We don't know.

But now, in this course, we are going to find out. Alright? We're gonna find out? Do you know how?

Okay, so here's the second question. Suppose we don't know to what extent the government is using data to make decisions? We need to find out. How are we gonna do that?

**Student:**

Just look at the government's policy to know that… do the government use the data to… using the policy to make, makes Hong Kong be better or not. Go to the government website, right? Are you saying, okay, go to the government website. Go to the legislative council website.

**Simon Wang:**

So those are the reports you can find, right? Well, of course, that's something we can do. You can go to different departments, you know, legislative council, they all got reports. And in the report, you may be able to see here and there, talking about to what extent they tend to use data.

But now, in this course, we're going to take a different approach, and I think this is a very fresh approach. Okay, unless you took my other GCAP course, you probably don't know this approach.

It's called Code on Access to Information. Have you heard of that? Code on access to information? From time to time, you will watch it on the street, or there's… could be on TV. It's called Gonhoi Jiu Xiaoza. Have you heard of it? Alright. So, in English, it's called on access to information. Now, we are going to use this code.

And to ask questions. We're going to send the questions directly to the department, to the specific department in the Hong Kong government, and ask them. The basic question is just the first question I raised. To what extent does the government—To what extent is your department using data to make decisions.

Alright? That's a very general question, but when you contextualize it, when you adapt this question to a specific problem or policy, it becomes a host of new questions that you have to ask.

And we have to be hurried. Because this semester, you know, every semester we've only got 13 weeks. But do you know how long it would take for the government to reply to us when you send off the question.

So suppose today, 2nd of September, you sent 3 questions, or 5 questions, to Department of Health. How long do you think they will get back to you?

Right, 3 weeks is the standard, kind of, expected time frame, alright? 3 weeks is the calendar week, okay? So, in other words, if you send a request right before the Christmas break, you know, that means they have more work to do. Anyway, 3 weeks is the normal time frame under the Code of Access to Information. But then they can, under so-called exceptional circumstances, they can extend it to another 7 weeks.

So that means… We need to be prepared for that kind of scenario. Alright, so maybe today, you send the questions, 7 weeks later, you will get the results. That's already, like, half of the semester gone, you see what I mean? So one way to avoid this kind of a situation is try to break down your inquiry into a smaller number of questions. Okay, because usually you ask a lot of questions, they will say, oh, we need more time to process. But if you treated it like a separate application, then they have to do it.

I feel like that's a little trick. Anyway, let's see, right, so very quickly, let me finish talking about objective.

So we are trying to offer some tools for—to practice the data analytics. And we are trying to figure out there could be a better way for the government to do things.

Alright, so after we got the information from the government regarding their practices, we are going to say, look, there's actually a better way to do this. And this is how—this is where Talia will come in. Because she got the background, she knows how to do math. And we are going to propose a better way to solve this problem. By using data. By using math.

Alright? And this is how we're going to build the argument, okay? This is very important. We're going to make this argument. The argument is, this is how the government is currently doing things. Okay, that's what we find out. And then, with the data we got, and with the math model and analytics, we propose that this is the better way to do things. Everybody can benefit. But the government—the government staff have to do things differently.

That's our argument. We hope we can make that argument strong. And then we're going to send the report to the lawmakers. Alright? Because the lawmakers are supposed to be the gatekeepers, right? So they approve all the funding requests, they're supposed to monitor the performance of the government staff.

Alright, so that's a very important part. Talia, do you want to quickly talk about some math tools that can make this happen?

**Talia Wu:**

Okay, thank you very much, Simon. Hello everyone, I'm Talia from the Math department. So, previously, Simon just introduced a very big picture of this course, the vision, the overview of this course. Now, for the following part, I will introduce some down-to-earth part of this course. So, exactly how much of the technology or math will be involved in this course.

So you can find the slides on Moodle.

So regarding the technology part, because nowadays people no longer use papers and pens to do the calculations or to do the mathematical modeling. So, in the end, we will use some programming language to help us to implement the mathematical models. And specifically in this course, we will use Python, which is a programming language that will help us to do data visualization, data analysis, and also setting up simulations.

So we will refer to this textbook, which is called the Learn AI Assisted Python Programming. Yeah, so instead of learning this programming language from scratch, we will try to make full use of AI to help us to do the very basic syntaxing.

So the way to do it is that we will use this GitHub Copilot, which is your AI programming assistant. So if you have no idea about what this Copilot can do, let's watch a very short video clip of the introduction.

Now that we have Copilot installed in our editors, let's take a look at how to use it. For today's example, I'll be using Python in VS Code. Create a new file called validate_email.py. Once you start typing, GitHub Copilot will generate suggestions based on what it believes you want to do. For example, I can import the re-module, and when I click enter, Copilot will give me suggested code based on what it believes I want to do.

See, when a user just typed the name of this file, valid email, and also imports related libraries, and after hitting the tab button, your Copilot can guess what you want to write. So here shows an example of define a new function, which is called the valid email. Whereas the input is an email address. And the expected output will be whether this email address is a valid one or not.

So this gray text is called the ghost text. It's the Copilot generated for users. Because the file is named Validate Email, it provides code for validating an email. I can click the tab key on my keyboard to accept a suggestion.

You see? The Copilot just generates the main body of this function for the users. Basically, we don't have to write anything, so it generates the two if conditions. So even if you do not know what it is, later we can see that you could ask Copilot to explain the meaning of the code to you, line by line.

When I click the return key, it keeps the fun going by providing the main function to run the code. If I hover over the suggested code, I can see the multiple options available to me. I can also open the completions panel to see even more suggestions that's been generated, and accept suggestions from there.

This is inline code complete in action. Where that gray text represents ghost texts that have Copilot's suggestions.

If you try this on your machine and you got a different response, that is okay. One thing to keep in mind when you're working with GitHub Copilot or any LLM is that responses are non-deterministic. This means that we're likely to get a different result each time we use GitHub Copilot, and the result I get may differ from the one that you get.

We can take this a step further by using GitHub Copilot Chats. Let's say we want to understand what this code means. I'm seeing it for the first time, and I want to get up to speed very quickly. I can open up Copilot Chat and type, slash explain, and get a detailed explanation of what's happening in the code. You'll notice that Copilot Chat has a view of the currently opened files, as indicated by the icon right here. When I click enter, I get a nicely formatted explanation off the code.

Yes, so here shows the line-by-line explanation of the meaning of the codes. It's very friendly. Now, let's say I wanted to improve the regex and allow users to enter multiple email addresses. So here, the user would like to change the request for this program. I can make that query right here in Copilot Chat. I can say, allow users to enter multiple email addresses for validation, and also improve the regex to be more robust. Then, I get a plan, an updated code block, and a list of changes that were made. I can click the Apply in Editor button to accept the changes, and GitHub Copilot will go in and make the updates on my behalf.

Yeah, so basically, it's like a one-stop solution. You have the updated code, and you apply it to the old code, and everything is done. So that is a very useful tool.

---

**Simon Wang:**

Maybe I'll just jump in as a language teacher, because I think the Copilot was designed primarily for people who at least know some programming. So, raise your hand if you have done zero programming before.

(Two students raise hands.)

Well, again, no worry, alright? So… I would say Copilot would be very helpful for those who actually doing programming, they actually learned how to program without AI before. So, so they, they know how to write a function, where to put the function here and there. So, so that's why autocomplete and everything would be good.

But even for people who have zero programming experience, I hope you won't be scared by this particular video, because you could be scared, because you have no idea what's going on here, right? So my suggestion would be… there's another approach, not necessarily using Copilot. All you have to do is just open up a fresh AI chatbot. And say, you are an experienced programmer with patience working with a non-programmer like me, and then you start to tell the AI what you want.

And then the chatbot can actually give you a framework, you know, try to understand the problem you're trying to solve, and then start from scratch, write a program for you. And then you can move it over to the VS Code and start using Copilot to debug and to improve, you see what I mean?

So again, my key message here is, even if you have no idea what is a Copilot, even if you have no idea what's a computer program, other than you use the program, because everybody uses the program, right? But very few people write the program. I would say this is a great opportunity for you to cross that threshold. From people who just use the program, to people who actually write the program.

Alright, so I hope that that's a little bit of encouragement for you. Yeah, thanks.

---

**Talia Wu:**

Thank you, Simon. Yeah, I think later, because we have the in-class exercise session, so we will have chance to provide exercise for you to get familiar with how this works. And we will be here to support students to try this AI-assisted programming tool. So, don't worry too much about the technical part.

And the point here is how Copilot changes how we learn to program. So in the past, we know that learner spends most of time on the syntax and also the structure of a program. So when talking about syntax, it means that we need to write or type something that the computer can understand. We need to know the, we need to remember those keywords, and also the punctuations. We need to put them in the correct way. Otherwise, there will be error messages, because the computer cannot understand what the code means.

That will take a lot of time for beginners to program. And also, the syntax is actually language-specific. So, suppose someone is very familiar with Python programming, but if you ask them to program in C++, or some other programming language, then, they may need to start all over again, starting from scratch again, because the syntax is usually language-specific. So that would take a lot of time.

And also, learners need to spend much time on the structure of the program. Say, they need to understand overall logic, how different parts of the programs are connected with each other, so that will also take a lot of time.

But now, with Copilot, as you can see from the video clip, it can generate the basic programs almost immediately, and almost always syntactically and structurally correct.

So, what users need to do is to precisely describe the program we want using words. Say, I want the function to handle multiple email addresses. So this is the request. In other words, we write a prompt instead of writing the code by ourselves.

So then, how did Copilot do this magic? Well, when we type a prompt, the co-pilot will send our prompt to the LLM, which is the large language model on the internet. And then the OpenAI's GPT large language model will interpret our prompt, and then generate code. So this is how the co-pilot works.

Well, you may think that, given that the co-pilot can generate the code for us, then are we done here? So are we just telling the co-pilot assistant, I want to do this and that, and everything will be done by copilot? Actually, it's not that easy.

Because during this process, there are still some skills that we need to develop. I think the most important skill with this AI assistant is that we need to develop the skill to break down a large problem into smaller tasks that Copilot can help us with. For example, we cannot ask Copilot, hey, write me a system to record or to manage all the students' information. Or, hey, write me a computer game. Oh, and make it fun.

So this kind of request is too much. Those requests are actually quite complicated. And it cannot be handled in one go by Copilot. So, we need to, along this journey, to see how we can break down a very large problem into smaller, tasks that can be handled or can be helped by Copilot.

And the second type of skill will be the prompt engineering. So, the way we talk to our co-pilot should be precise. So this also needs some trial and error, and also need to gain experience with it. Because, sometimes, with even a slightly different way to talk to the co-pilot, the outcome of the code will be quite different.

So I think these two skills are those we still need to pay attention, need to develop, even though we have this very friendly, AI programming assistant.

And then, talking about math, so we will only cover two types of math models in this course.

In a previous roadmap, if you still can recall, in our roadmap, in week 3 and week 4, we will have two case studies. So during the case studies, we will analyze a specific public policy or public management-related problem. And we will see how to use the mathematical models, I will mention, one is optimization, the other is regression, to study the specific research questions.

So, detailed methodology part will be introduced in third and fourth week. But here, at the first week, now I will just give a very brief overview of these two mathematical models.

So, the first model, as mentioned, is optimization. So actually, optimization is seen every day, and many type of problems can be categorized as optimization problems. Especially if you took the Level 1 GE course called Making a Smart Decision. That's a course related to using graph to solve optimization problems.

So, giving some examples of optimization in our everyday life. For example, when we want to travel from one place to the other, we always try to find the shortest path from one place to the other. The shortest path, in terms of minimizing the distance between the two places, so it's type of optimization.

And also, from the perspective of producers, they want to minimize the amount of waste production, and they always want to minimize the cost. And, to also, at the same time, to maximize their profit.

Also, as a passenger, we always want to have the shortest queuing time, to improve our user experience. And as a student, you may want to minimize your study time, whereas at the same time, to achieve maximizing the course score, right? So that's all about the optimization.

And the overall objective of doing optimization is to achieve efficient system operation. In our daily life, when we kind of make decisions, we somehow always want to make the so-called smart decision, in a sense that we want to optimize the outcome.

Well, there are many, classical ways to work on the optimization type of problem. For example, we can have a type of question, which is called linear programming, where we want—we can write out a very explicit formula for the objective. We want to either minimize it or maximize it, but with certain constraints. So we can also explicitly write out all those constraints in formulas or in functions. And then we try to solve those equations, then try to find the best solution, which can achieve our minimization or maximization, while at the same time fulfill all the constraints.

But that is a very theoretical thing. We won't introduce any theoretical method to solve the optimization problem. Instead, we will use the so-called simulation modeling.

So, to give you an idea of what simulation modeling means, I will show you one of the previous students' work.

(Description of a bus simulation project follows, including how simulation data can help optimize bus frequency decisions.)

So, in summary, we use simulation as a virtual experiment to test real-world scenarios, and this approach is accessible for students from any background.

And then, the other type of math model we'll use is regression, specifically linear regression, to study the relationships between variables, such as how population density impacts demand for public services, or what factors influence support for public policy. We'll use Python's scikit-learn library for this.

The math required for this course will not exceed introductory statistics and math content.

**Simon Wang:**

Thanks, Talia. Again, for students with strong math background, this is a good opportunity to apply math skills to real-world problems. For those with limited math background, or haven't done much math recently, I think this is a good opportunity to expand one's toolkit. I'm not saying that necessarily you will become a very proficient user of these tools by the end of this course, but at least you will be aware of such options. You are aware that these tools are available. It is possible to do this kind of modeling, this kind of analysis, that can gain more insights.

And that awareness is important because when you work in a team. It's not a matter of how much you know, or how many skills you can master. It's a matter of how you can work with different people. Especially if you're a leader, you need to know how to bring together all the people from different backgrounds and work together. And by taking this course, you will become much more comfortable working with someone with the math skills, with the programming skills, comparatively, if you don't take this course, alright? So I hope that that's, that's, clear kind of argument for… for… Give it a try.
