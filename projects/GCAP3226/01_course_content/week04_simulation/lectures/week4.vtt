1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:18.440
Simon Wang: Alright, so, we are in week 4 now for our course, and, before we get started, I just want to invite all the students to, log in with your HKBU credentials, so you will be able to have access to this page.

2
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:37.409
Simon Wang: And not every student will have access to this page. By default, I think only the students from science faculty, will have access to the API key. But I submitted your name to ITO, so you should be able to access this page as well.

3
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.280
Simon Wang: So very briefly, I want to explain what is API. API stands for Application Programming Interface.

4
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.829
Simon Wang: Which is a different way to communicate with the computer system. The more conventional, typical way of

5
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.610
Simon Wang: Communicate with the computer system is through what we call graphical user interface.

6
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:08.010
Simon Wang: Like what you can see now. So, you see there's some graphics, and you enter, you type some text.

7
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.920
Simon Wang: And you will be able to communicate, and the chatbot will respond in a graphical user interface.

8
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.559
Simon Wang: But the application programming interface is, a different interface in the sense that, we do not use this kind of,

9
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:38.809
Simon Wang: GUI, or graphical user interface, instead of we write codes. And, through the codes, and we, following the protocols and rules specified in the API, so that

10
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.889
Simon Wang: Our computer program can communicate with a computer system, like large language model.

11
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.160
Simon Wang: Now, the reason we need you to grab this key

12
00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:00.810
Simon Wang: is because later on, you need to enter the key into a platform that we built. And this way, our platform will be able to leverage

13
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.150
Simon Wang: the ITO's platform, and Because, you know, tokens are not free.

14
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:21.839
Simon Wang: You know, that's the basic fact. The fact that whenever you talk to a large language model, somebody has to run the computer somewhere to process your response and to run the model.

15
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:41.219
Simon Wang: So, tokens are not free, and ITO actually bought a lot of tokens from Microsoft Azure, and therefore, each of us can access the HKBU General AI services. Now, when you got the API key, and you enter to our system.

16
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.510
Simon Wang: you will be able to use the token from HKB UITO allocated to you.

17
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.299
Simon Wang: And, and then you can enjoy the services, okay? So I hope that's…

18
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:11.550
Simon Wang: clear enough instructions or explanation. If it doesn't make sense to you, that's okay, because you don't have to understand everything in order to use it, right? So all you have to do is just come to this page.

19
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.819
Simon Wang: and generate the API key, and remember, once you generate the key, you have to keep it somewhere, okay? Because it will show once only.

20
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.699
Simon Wang: And I'm not going to generate my key again, because I already generated before.

21
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.310
Simon Wang: So, go ahead and do that, and keep it in a place that's safe, okay? So, any, any question?

22
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.030
Simon Wang: So take some time and, get your key.

23
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.279
Simon Wang: I think I need to find mine as well.

24
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:22.570
Simon Wang: Now, Okay, I think, we should officially get started. We've got 27 students here, which is great.

25
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:35.929
Simon Wang: Well, again, I just want to very briefly talk about… because today, the reason why we are, we are having this, online meeting is because Typhoon, so I want to very quickly, share with you two letters

26
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.859
Simon Wang: that I… I published a while ago.

27
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.829
Simon Wang: about Typhoon, so… because, in this course, we're trying to…

28
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:58.519
Simon Wang: look at the government's decision and how data is being used to inform the government decisions, and we don't just do things within the classroom. This is an experiential learning course, so we actually want students to experience

29
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.220
Simon Wang: something different, something that you don't typically get in a university classroom. So…

30
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:24.640
Simon Wang: One thing that I hope some of you can experience is actually if you write letters to South China Morning Post, because this way you will be able to voice your opinions, you're going to join a conversation about public policy. So here's one example. If you still remember, I don't know whether you remember, this was a letter published

31
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:35.700
Simon Wang: Beck… In 2018, when there's this typhoon called, Menkok, so,

32
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.579
Simon Wang: rumor says that, you know, the coming typhoon is as strong, or even stronger than this one.

33
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:59.469
Simon Wang: But look at what happened, the day after typhoon. You know, people get stuck in this, in this, MTR station in Taiwai. And, I was… I was writing, you know, I wrote this letter to argue that actually, we should consider

34
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.050
Simon Wang: Allowing people to take a break after the typhoon.

35
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.160
Simon Wang: In case, you know, the city, you know, needs some time to recover.

36
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.179
Simon Wang: So, so that's, that's one, one…

37
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.739
Simon Wang: letter I want to share with you.

38
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:27.020
Simon Wang: And I think it's important to take a data-driven approach to this kind of decision-making. I don't know whether the Security Bureau or the Office of Chief Executive has been reviewing this case.

39
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:44.890
Simon Wang: I hope they have learned a lesson, because in terms of data-driven approach, we should definitely look at the whole, you know, transportation network, the infrastructure, to what extent there's damages to the system that the city needs time to recover.

40
00:06:45.090 --> 00:07:02.490
Simon Wang: Right? So, so that's… that's a very important, case we want to, we want to consider. In fact, we have one team who's going to work on Typhoon, this semester, so I hope that team can also take a look at, this, this issue.

41
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:10.240
Simon Wang: Now, another letter I want to share with you, it was published in, last year, actually, 2024,

42
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.660
Simon Wang: Because starting from last year.

43
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:23.030
Simon Wang: the Hong Kong stock market will actually operate as usual, even when there's a typhoon.

44
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:31.200
Simon Wang: So, this, this is a new, new arrangement, starting from last year, and the argument I was trying to make is that

45
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.079
Simon Wang: as the title suggests, if the Hong Kong stock is changed.

46
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:43.250
Simon Wang: Could operate as usual, you know, because people work from home and, etc.

47
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:54.989
Simon Wang: then everybody should be doing that. Knowledge workers, schools, universities, we should all just, work as usual, you know, even during the typhoon days.

48
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.270
Simon Wang: But, unfortunately, at this stage, the Education Bureau

49
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:17.589
Simon Wang: the universities do not really have any official policies over how work should be arranged during the typhoon days. So again, if we think about data-driven approach, if we think about how we can help the government to make better decisions, then we need to

50
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:31.560
Simon Wang: start thinking about how to collect the data, how to use the data to, inform the decisions, alright? So, you know, because of today's timing, I just want to kind of share with, two, essays that,

51
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.280
Simon Wang: I published it a while ago.

52
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.820
Simon Wang: And another quick update is I've created

53
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:58.939
Simon Wang: Google Drive folders for each team, because I think right now we've got six teams. Each team has already selected a specific topic, so we're kind of ready to move on, to start actually working on the projects. So, anyone who is not yet in a team.

54
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.409
Simon Wang: or anyone who cannot access to the Google Drive folder that I share through the small WhatsApp group.

55
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:21.299
Simon Wang: please let me know. You can send a message to the small WhatsApp group, you need to give me your Gmail account. In fact, your classmates, your groupmates who have access to the Google folder, Google Drive folder, they should be able to invite you to access the Google folder.

56
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:36.520
Simon Wang: Alright? So, within the Google Drive folder, you will be able to see a couple of Google Docs. Okay, so all these Google Docs are empty at this stage, but just to kind of quickly go through this…

57
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:55.160
Simon Wang: We will have a meeting notes page. Basically, whenever we meet, whenever we have any progress on the project, you need to update the meeting notes, and you probably want to meet with your teammates from time to time to, you know, start working on the project, then you should update the meeting notes.

58
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.270
Simon Wang: We have a data collection plan, because,

59
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.110
Simon Wang: Next week, we're going to have small group meetings, and the week after is actually public holiday.

60
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.099
Simon Wang: So you should take the time to… the whole week, to doing some data collection.

61
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:15.600
Simon Wang: So, that page, that doc, is for you to update records about data collection.

62
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:24.820
Simon Wang: And there's also a worksheet, this is just a spreadsheet for you to, in case you want to have, put some structured data in that sheet, you can do that.

63
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.739
Simon Wang: We have a project report.

64
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:43.309
Simon Wang: document, that's where you can actually start planning your project report. This, this document, I think I'm going to rename it because, you know, on a second thought, I think this document should be more about outreach and presentation, so I'm going to rename it later.

65
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:50.319
Simon Wang: So basically, this Google Drive folder is where you want to do some real work, and you want to move forward.

66
00:10:50.410 --> 00:11:06.870
Simon Wang: And just one quick reminder about doing everything is you want to document your contribution, okay? So whenever you're updating the document, whenever you are making some efforts to move the project forward, write down everything you have done with your name on it.

67
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:25.740
Simon Wang: Okay? Because at some point, we will start reviewing, everybody's work, we want to make sure that everybody contributes fairly to the teamwork, because part of the… I think about 50% of the whole course grades is by groups. But, we definitely want, you know, students to.

68
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:34.770
Simon Wang: contribute, and we enjoy teamwork, and we work together. So, it's very important to keep record of everything you do.

69
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.139
Simon Wang: In, in this space.

70
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:56.149
Simon Wang: Alright, and both Taylor and I, we have access to this space as well, and feel free to raise any questions, you can add the questions here, and then you can, you know, send us the link through the WhatsApp group or email us, and basically, this is going to be the platform where we're going to do the collaboration work.

71
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.819
Simon Wang: Okay, so any, any questions, any concerns, just, let us know.

72
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:11.009
Simon Wang: And this is actually a website I built a bit earlier,

73
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:16.049
Simon Wang: you can check out. It's kind of fun, because we use them

74
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:24.929
Simon Wang: API to access the data from Hong Kong Observatory, and we update this in real time, so we'll be able to see

75
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.980
Simon Wang: dumb, the wind data from the 30 stations

76
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:44.420
Simon Wang: And to see whether… to what extent the real, wing strings actually align with the signal number that the observatory published. But I won't get into details, because that's…

77
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:53.769
Simon Wang: basically the project of one of the teams. But just for fun, because you can see that the storm is coming, and we should be able to look at the data in real time.

78
00:12:55.010 --> 00:13:02.599
Simon Wang: Right? Now… Before I invite, Taliet, you know, for Dr. Wu to talk about

79
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:18.889
Simon Wang: simulation, which is the main focus of today's topic, today's work discussion, because last week we talked about regression, this week we talked about simulation, there's a little bit more, in-class exercise we're going to work on. I want to talk about reflective essay.

80
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:36.269
Simon Wang: Now, a reflective essay is one of the assessment components. It actually accounts for 20% of the final grades. There's a total of 3 reflective essays you need to write, and this essay is not very long, it's only about 200 words.

81
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:46.369
Simon Wang: And one of the, kind of, the special features of this course is that you can use AI to write an essay. So we have some AI chatbot.

82
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:55.719
Simon Wang: that can help you, which is the reason why we invite you to set up the API key from the ITO page, right?

83
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.720
Simon Wang: So, if you come to this Moodle page.

84
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.070
Simon Wang: you will be able to see there's the reflective essay assignment. The deadline is,

85
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:20.700
Simon Wang: about two weeks from now, okay? So, there's a little bit of time you can work on, so just take your time, and you don't have to submit it just yet, so any question you may have, just let us know.

86
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:28.499
Simon Wang: The way you submit this essay is just to reply, okay? So you reply here.

87
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:34.369
Simon Wang: And you can submit your… Your essay.

88
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:45.620
Simon Wang: Now, actually, you can read through this Moodle, so a Moodle page, so I'm not going to get into everything, but just one thing to highlight is that we have this

89
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.290
Simon Wang: Page.

90
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:53.689
Simon Wang: This is where you can actually, talk to an AI, okay?

91
00:14:54.190 --> 00:15:06.929
Simon Wang: So we have this AI writing assistance, as you can see. You need to reflect on what you have learned in the past 4 weeks or so, and also you want to start thinking about the project, alright?

92
00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:14.490
Simon Wang: Because in the past 2 weeks, well, including this week, The main task

93
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:26.250
Simon Wang: we're trying to teach you, well, especially Italia, is trying to teach you some tools, okay, for quantitative reasoning. We talked about regression, last week talked about… we're going to talk about simulation.

94
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:33.859
Simon Wang: And once you learn a little bit about these tools, you need to think about how these tools will be applied to your projects.

95
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:41.649
Simon Wang: And while you're doing that, you can start writing this refractive essay, okay? So…

96
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.309
Simon Wang: As you can see here, there's a little bit of information, and you can go back to the Moodle page.

97
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:54.259
Simon Wang: But then… how do you use the tutor? Well, basically, you need to get your key.

98
00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:01.680
Simon Wang: And then you click here, That will give you… get you to the… the tutor page.

99
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.779
Simon Wang: This is iframe, so it takes a while to load.

100
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:20.140
Simon Wang: And, here is where you want to enter the key. Okay, let me see if I got my key.

101
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.379
Simon Wang: So you got your key.

102
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:38.129
Simon Wang: And you choose your model, usually 4.1 would be good, and then you click connect.

103
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.200
Simon Wang: Now, once you click connect, you get connected.

104
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.910
Simon Wang: Right, and then there's some system prompt here. There's a welcome prompt here, it says, You know,

105
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:58.620
Simon Wang: This is your tutor for the course, you need to write a short, refractive essay and everything.

106
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.570
Simon Wang: And said, type OK to get started, then you type OK.

107
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:20.580
Simon Wang: Okay, and then the tutorial will start talking to you. Great, let's get started. Thinking about your team project, where were your… the key decisions made by the government that your team plans to focus on?

108
00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:29.640
Simon Wang: Remember, we have this post that we talked about a while ago, we talk about, like.

109
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:34.499
Simon Wang: the group project instruction and timeline, I think we talked about this in week 2 or something.

110
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:42.999
Simon Wang: So, last week and this week, we explored topics, we talked about the tools, and next week, when we do the group consultation, we need to

111
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:48.099
Simon Wang: you know, finalize the top… I think everybody already selected topic, but then we have to start working on it.

112
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:52.670
Simon Wang: So go through this page, And then you come back.

113
00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:59.690
Simon Wang: And you can start talking, so something like, maybe you can just, use an example.

114
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:05.960
Simon Wang: whether… to… Hello, people.

115
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.320
Simon Wang: To take a day off after.

116
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.599
Simon Wang: Typhoon. So just, just, just as an example, okay?

117
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.109
Simon Wang: And, and, you have a conversation with, with the chatbot.

118
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:26.860
Simon Wang: and go, and so on and so forth, and then your teams look at this, think about the data, right? How did the government use the data to inform the decision, blah blah blah.

119
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.070
Simon Wang: And you can say what…

120
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.159
Simon Wang: You can say something like, what would you suggest?

121
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.210
Simon Wang: And also you can close this if you want a bit more space.

122
00:18:54.660 --> 00:19:00.469
Simon Wang: Okay, and then you can, you can start, ask the chatbot about…

123
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:14.680
Simon Wang: the model and everything, okay? But just to remember, AI can hallucinate. You know, AI is not 100% reliable. So part of the skills you need to learn in this course when you interact with AI is to be critical.

124
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:26.129
Simon Wang: Okay, don't just take anything that AI says as correct, or as completely reliable, alright? So you keep going like this for a little while.

125
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:33.070
Simon Wang: And then you click this green button. Well, actually, at some point.

126
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.750
Simon Wang: You know, the chapel will start… guide you to write an essay.

127
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.170
Simon Wang: But if you say, can you write…

128
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.370
Simon Wang: the essay. Well, actually, when you say, can you write an essay for me?

129
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:54.159
Simon Wang: The chat will probably help you to write an essay. But remember, you still have to put a lot of thoughts into it, okay?

130
00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.549
Simon Wang: Because, because what we're trying to do in this course is…

131
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.070
Simon Wang: Okay, so actually, they write an essay for you, you see what I mean?

132
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:16.649
Simon Wang: But that's not… clearly not what you want to do to just submit it to the Moodle, right? So you actually have to put more thoughts and everything. But again, when you click here.

133
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:21.480
Simon Wang: You got… You got a, a page.

134
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:27.339
Simon Wang: Where you can, get a chat history and a little bit of analysis of what you have done.

135
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.469
Simon Wang: And, you, you can put your ad… you can put your email here, because…

136
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.609
Simon Wang: We don't have a login system.

137
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:46.129
Simon Wang: once you close the browser, everything is gone, okay? So, before you close your browser, make sure that you… you click the green button here, green check, and then you email.

138
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.760
Simon Wang: Alright, so, so you will get an email copy.

139
00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:55.750
Simon Wang: Of the chat history. And your teacher will also get an email copy of the report.

140
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.860
Simon Wang: And if you want to download.

141
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.759
Simon Wang: You can also download the Markdown or PDF.

142
00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.920
Simon Wang: Okay

143
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:22.329
Simon Wang: So that's the… that's the platform we built to help you, okay? So I hope you will enjoy it, I hope it's a good experience for you, because we believe that AI is going to be the partner for all of us, you know, especially when you become a knowledge worker after you graduate.

144
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:29.540
Simon Wang: So we want to create an authentic learning experience for you, that's why we have this AI platform for you to try, and…

145
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:44.229
Simon Wang: And just a kind of disclaimer, the platform is relatively new, and there could be some glitches, some, you know, bugs and everything, so please be patient, and do let us know how it goes, and

146
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:58.900
Simon Wang: try to keep a record of everything you do, just in case you, you know, close the browser or something, or the copy may not… the email function may not work properly, then download the Markdown, or download the…

147
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:05.029
Simon Wang: the, PDF before you hit the send button and before you close the browser.

148
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:11.370
Simon Wang: Alright, so I think that's all I have to say. Any questions?

149
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:33.720
Simon Wang: Remember, in the Moodle forum, we actually have one post for each topic. I think the information here is still useful. You do want to come back to kind of learn more about how this, project, you know, how you should pursue this project. And we have the smaller WhatsApp group for each team.

150
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:44.229
Simon Wang: we should work very closely, through the WhatsApp group, and, you know, you guys may want to, you know, set some meetings, and, because, you know.

151
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.980
Simon Wang: I think the goal is for us to…

152
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:54.070
Simon Wang: Send off inquiries to, to the government, around, next week.

153
00:22:54.280 --> 00:23:06.799
Simon Wang: So you need to start thinking about that as well. And we're going to have another chatbot to help you with that, but for now, this chatbot for writing reflective

154
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:18.640
Simon Wang: journal, a reflective essay, should be a good start, because you only take the opportunity to reflect on what you have learned, and also to think about how you move forward, with the other… with the projects.

155
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.390
Simon Wang: Okay?

156
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.300
Simon Wang: So, any, any question?

157
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.540
Simon Wang: I think a good place to start is actually… this Moodle page.

158
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:37.600
Simon Wang: Because… I think this is the page where… You should have everything.

159
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.470
Simon Wang: I saw some message on the chat.

160
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.370
Simon Wang: Oh.

161
00:23:52.650 --> 00:24:00.740
Simon Wang: Oh, okay, so I think I need to update the Moodle page about the deadline, because we kind of extend the deadline a little bit, so,

162
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.700
Simon Wang: Yeah.

163
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:08.249
Simon Wang: So, one question about the Moodle page, I think I need to update that.

164
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:13.089
Simon Wang: I think the deadline should be October 5th.

165
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:20.020
Simon Wang: What should invite accounts says it's not eligible to use the API service.

166
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.840
Simon Wang: I think you have to log out and log in again.

167
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:33.280
Simon Wang: Because the… ITO colleagues told me that they have already updated

168
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:52.559
Simon Wang: the records, so all the names that I submitted should have access to the API service. If you cannot, you log out, and then log in again. If you still cannot access the page, just email me, and I will follow up, because I'm sure that I submitted everybody's name.

169
00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.070
Simon Wang: Any other… Questions?

170
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.320
Simon Wang: Okay, so…

171
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:13.249
Simon Wang: I think, that's all I have to say. I'm going to pass the floor to Talia to talk about simulation.

172
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:20.890
Tian WU: Okay, so good morning, everyone.

173
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.339
Tian WU: Can you hear me clearly?

174
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.089
Simon Wang: Yeah, okay.

175
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:34.540
Tian WU: Okay, so, can you see my screen of the Moodle page?

176
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:40.960
Tian WU: We're seeing…

177
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.659
Simon Wang: VS Code.

178
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.479
Tian WU: Let me share my screen again.

179
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.620
Tian WU: So now should be the Moodle page, right?

180
00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:52.790
Simon Wang: Yes.

181
00:25:52.790 --> 00:26:02.450
Tian WU: Yeah, okay, so before I started the, explanation, I would like to remind you that I updated the,

182
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.560
Tian WU: Jupyter Notebook for the regression part.

183
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.309
Tian WU: And I also uploaded a new joker notebook, which is called the Box Whisker Plot.

184
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:22.480
Tian WU: And also, we have the simulation notebook for today's demonstration. So these are the three documents you may download.

185
00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.189
Tian WU: So later, we will discuss them one by one.

186
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:41.319
Tian WU: And before I start, talking about the simulation, I would like to follow up on the last in-class exercise, which is about some data visualization you worked on.

187
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:53.290
Tian WU: Let me share… Okay, so now my shared screen should be the, VS Code.

188
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:54.920
Tian WU: Page Wright.

189
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:08.959
Tian WU: So last time, at the end of the in-class exercise, I invited you to do two visualization tests to explore the relationship of,

190
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.299
Tian WU: That might be interesting.

191
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:19.430
Tian WU: So recall that the data set we used is the municipal solid waste dataset.

192
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.340
Tian WU: Where our response variable is the level of support for this policy.

193
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:33.679
Tian WU: And the potential explanatory variables, including the demographic variables, attitude-related variables, and behavior-related variables.

194
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.789
Tian WU: And when I received the in-class exercise.

195
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.710
Tian WU: This is the typical visualization result I get.

196
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:51.539
Tian WU: So you can see for the first visualization, it is about the support level versus the perceived fairness of the policy.

197
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:57.160
Tian WU: But what you would observe are these, separated dots.

198
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:04.520
Tian WU: It is because, for fairness and the support level, they're both categorical variables.

199
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:13.040
Tian WU: they can only take values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. There's very limited and discrete integers.

200
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.240
Tian WU: Okay.

201
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:19.069
Tian WU: So all the possible combinations are shown by these dots.

202
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:28.240
Tian WU: But this is not that informative, given that these two variables, they are categorical.

203
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:36.920
Tian WU: So I think a better way to do it is… Then open.

204
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:44.850
Tian WU: The latest regression… notebook.

205
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.499
Tian WU: So here, it's actually used the bar chart.

206
00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:04.449
Tian WU: To show, in different categories of perceived fairness.

207
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:09.449
Tian WU: What are the percentages of opposed, neutral, and support?

208
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:18.329
Tian WU: So to do this, we can first record the, strongly against and against as opposed.

209
00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:28.190
Tian WU: And we code very strongly support and support as support, so we will overall have these three groups.

210
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:34.129
Tian WU: And then… Show the percentages of these three groups.

211
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.830
Tian WU: In different categories of this perceived fairness.

212
00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:48.650
Tian WU: So if we… show… Again, the two variables in this way, we can easily observe the trend.

213
00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:58.390
Tian WU: With the increase of the perceived fairness of this policy, The percentages of a post decrease.

214
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.880
Tian WU: Right? The blue bars, the height, decreased.

215
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:06.430
Tian WU: Whereas for the height of the green bars.

216
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.669
Tian WU: The percentages of support is increasing from, like, 11% to 75%.

217
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:20.660
Tian WU: So the message is that if the variables themselves are categorical.

218
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.320
Tian WU: Then, it is better to use bar charts.

219
00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.960
Tian WU: And using percentages.

220
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.549
Tian WU: To represent for different categories.

221
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:35.790
Tian WU: The percentages of different, groups.

222
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:39.170
Tian WU: For… for the other categorical variable.

223
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:49.900
Tian WU: I think for this, figure, it is… More informative compared to these dots.

224
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.109
Tian WU: Right, hopefully you, agree with me.

225
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:59.489
Tian WU: So when we do the visualization, we need to consider the type of data.

226
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.620
Tian WU: So then, when we use this scatter plot.

227
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:14.230
Tian WU: Well, when the variables are continuous, it is more often to use the scatterplot to show the relationship between the two variables.

228
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.750
Tian WU: So I think in the demo.

229
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:23.570
Tian WU: We once used the, scatter plot to Let me find it.

230
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.649
Tian WU: So now I'm at this regression model's full notebook.

231
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.179
Tian WU: Yeah, here.

232
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:41.919
Tian WU: So this is not a good example, but at least the, one of the variables

233
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:48.499
Tian WU: the distance between home and the nearest facilities. This is a continuous variable.

234
00:31:49.330 --> 00:32:02.490
Tian WU: And for this scatter plot, we can see whether, on average, with the increase of the distance between the home of the participant of the survey to the nearest

235
00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:08.300
Tian WU: Recycling facility, whether their support level is increasing or decreasing.

236
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:19.469
Tian WU: So most of the time, we use Scatterflow to measure or to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.

237
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.400
Tian WU: This is the first message.

238
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.620
Tian WU: And the second is about the, plot.

239
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:34.020
Tian WU: Showing the education level versus the level of support.

240
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.830
Tian WU: So again, education level is a categorical variable.

241
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:55.320
Tian WU: Right, it can only take these discrete values, 1, 2, 3, 4, and we know the larger the value, it represents the, respondents has, a higher education, higher level of education.

242
00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:08.200
Tian WU: So again, if these two are both categorical, a more appropriate way to visualize the relationship should be, again, the bar plot, showing the percentages.

243
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:19.880
Tian WU: In each, there's different, level of education, the, percentages of the, against, neutral, and support.

244
00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.320
Tian WU: And here, this plot is actually a box whisker plot.

245
00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.169
Tian WU: And this is usually used to show the distribution.

246
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.390
Tian WU: Of a continuous variable.

247
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:40.829
Tian WU: So I will give, a numerical example to…

248
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:46.569
Tian WU: To show you what does this box mean, and what this whiskers mean.

249
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.299
Tian WU: So now let's move to the box whisker plot.

250
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.430
Tian WU: I mentioned this notebook in the Moodle.

251
00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:02.380
Tian WU: So suppose I have this sequence of values, So I generated these values.

252
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.149
Tian WU: In total, there are 26.

253
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:10.629
Tian WU: And they are, capped as two decimal places.

254
00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:13.049
Tian WU: And it is already sorted.

255
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:21.990
Tian WU: So the smallest is from 0.15, and the largest is from 4.85.

256
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:27.629
Tian WU: to generate the box whisker plot.

257
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:33.710
Tian WU: We need to calculate the so-called five-point summary statistics for these data points.

258
00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:41.369
Tian WU: Specifically, when you find the minimum value, which is obviously 0.15,

259
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:47.319
Tian WU: And also the maximum value, which is 4.85, right?

260
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.099
Tian WU: And for the middle 3-1, They are median.

261
00:34:53.460 --> 00:35:00.940
Tian WU: So the median basically means the data points were cut the whole data set into two parts.

262
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:08.830
Tian WU: So the first 50% of the data, their value will be smaller than the median.

263
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:16.509
Tian WU: And the remaining around 50% of the data, their value, will be greater than the median value.

264
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:23.109
Tian WU: So, in our dataset, Given that there are 26 values.

265
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.080
Tian WU: So there will be two values sitting in the middle.

266
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:32.259
Tian WU: Which is the, 13th

267
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:36.280
Tian WU: 13th data, and the 14th data.

268
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.140
Tian WU: For each role, there are 5 data points.

269
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:48.260
Tian WU: So, the 13th data point is here, and the 14th data point is here.

270
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.909
Tian WU: And the median will be the average value of the two data points.

271
00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.800
Tian WU: So we take average of these two, and it is 0.8.

272
00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:12.959
Tian WU: So here, originally, the data points are not exactly two decimal places. So after some rounding, we have this 0.79 and 0.8.

273
00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:19.509
Tian WU: And after we take average, and again, doing the rounding, the median is 0.8.

274
00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.469
Tian WU: So this means that if we have a

275
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:29.310
Tian WU: Like, you imagine that if there is a, little vertical bar here.

276
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:33.960
Tian WU: This is the first 50% of the data.

277
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:40.350
Tian WU: Given that This data is already sorted from the smallest to the largest.

278
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:46.840
Tian WU: Whereas the remaining ones are the later. So from here.

279
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.560
Tian WU: These are the later, or the largest, the 50% of the data.

280
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:57.170
Tian WU: So this is what this medium means.

281
00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:08.890
Tian WU: And in the box and whisker plot, this mean is usually shown as the, the horizontal bar in the middle of the box.

282
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.819
Tian WU: So if we go back to this education level.

283
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:20.650
Tian WU: you see this horizontal line in the middle of the box? So this is the median.

284
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:25.360
Tian WU: Median value of the, of these data points.

285
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:37.130
Tian WU: But we also need to decide the, where this, edge of the box is. So there are two edges, the upper one and lower one.

286
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:41.849
Tian WU: And we need to decide, what this corresponding value is.

287
00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:48.049
Tian WU: And to do that, we need to calculate the so-called the Q1 and Q3.

288
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.159
Tian WU: So it's the, quartile one.

289
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:58.150
Tian WU: So this is the, value in the dataset that will split

290
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:08.289
Tian WU: The first 50% of data, again, into two parts, So, 25% and another 25%.

291
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:17.690
Tian WU: For example, for this data, we know that for these highlighted values, These are the first, like.

292
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:21.649
Tian WU: 50% of the data, right? 13 of them.

293
00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:30.330
Tian WU: And then the value sitting in the middle will be the 7th data point.

294
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.410
Tian WU: So in total, we have 13 data points.

295
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:46.020
Tian WU: And the seventh data point will split the certain data points into… there are six, data points.

296
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.900
Tian WU: Before, there's 0.57.

297
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.379
Tian WU: And another 6 data points after this 0.57.

298
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.850
Tian WU: Within the first half, of this dataset.

299
00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:04.149
Tian WU: So then the Q1 value will be 0.57.

300
00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:16.380
Tian WU: Whereas, similarly, for this Q3, we focus on the, the median of the Later, 50% of the data.

301
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:21.610
Tian WU: So here is the later 50% of our data.

302
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:26.170
Tian WU: And we just count the 7ths, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.

303
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.919
Tian WU: So this… this 1.64 will split

304
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:39.549
Tian WU: The later 13 data points into two parts.

305
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:43.790
Tian WU: 6 before it, and 6 after it.

306
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.349
Tian WU: So this is the, Q3.

307
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:55.339
Tian WU: And with this, 5… point, summary statistics, we can decide where the box is.

308
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.930
Tian WU: So if I scroll down a little bit.

309
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:07.090
Tian WU: You can see that on the right-hand side of this figure is box and whisker plot.

310
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:12.640
Tian WU: In total, there are 26 values, all are kept as two decimal places.

311
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:20.200
Tian WU: The median is shown by this green line. The median is 0.8.

312
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.920
Tian WU: So you can find the corresponding value here.

313
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.080
Tian WU: And for the edge of the box.

314
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.830
Tian WU: here is the value of Q1.

315
00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:37.620
Tian WU: So we calculate the Q1 is 0.57, This value is around 0.57.

316
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:44.550
Tian WU: And the upper edge of this box The value is 1.64.

317
00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.730
Tian WU: So here.

318
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:51.910
Tian WU: The corresponding value on the y-axis is 1.64.

319
00:40:53.290 --> 00:41:03.050
Tian WU: And we also have this minimum and maximum value, so the minimum value is 0.15, which is the end of this whisker.

320
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:15.050
Tian WU: Whereas… The maximum is 4.85, It is flying out of the, the whisker on the top.

321
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:21.540
Tian WU: So then, how do we decide which values are flying outside of the range?

322
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:30.820
Tian WU: Well, this is decided by calculating the so-called inner fence, So the inner fence.

323
00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:39.069
Tian WU: depends on the IQR, where the IQR is the Q3 minus Q1.

324
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.729
Tian WU: In this graph, the IQR represents the height of this box.

325
00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:53.440
Tian WU: Right, because here, this value is Q3, and this value is Q1.

326
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:58.490
Tian WU: So if IQR equals to Q3 minus Q1,

327
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.199
Tian WU: It represents the height of the box.

328
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:08.890
Tian WU: And the lower fence is calculated by the IQR minus 1.5.

329
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:15.949
Tian WU: times… Sorry, Q1 minus 1.5 times IQR.

330
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.619
Tian WU: So the formula It's shown in the code.

331
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.440
Tian WU: Here, for these three lines.

332
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.389
Tian WU: Because there's no,

333
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:40.330
Tian WU: predefined formula to calculate the IQR and also the so-called lower and upper fans, so we have to manually calculate these values.

334
00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:52.110
Tian WU: So previously, we have calculated the value of Q1 and Q3, and we also know how… how tall that box is.

335
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:59.539
Tian WU: So we can just substitute the value and get the inner lower fans and inner upper fans.

336
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:10.629
Tian WU: So, after calculation, we found the lower fence is negative 1, and the upper fence is 3.2,

337
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.289
Tian WU: As long as the data point

338
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.410
Tian WU: Is lying out of the range.

339
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.160
Tian WU: From negative 1 to 3, then we will define the data points as outliers.

340
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:31.050
Tian WU: In our dataset, There are 3 values.

341
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.930
Tian WU: That are greater than this upper fence.

342
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:38.699
Tian WU: So you will see the corresponding three data points.

343
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.369
Tian WU: Flying out of the range of this box.

344
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:43.850
Tian WU: And whisker plot.

345
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:49.660
Tian WU: And the… the end of this whisker

346
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:58.730
Tian WU: Will… will be the largest value in our dataset, which is not ex… exceeding the upper fence.

347
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:06.350
Tian WU: So here, the, the end of this edge is, like, 2.15.

348
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:16.020
Tian WU: And as I mentioned, this box plot is used to visualize.

349
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:20.049
Tian WU: First of all, must be the continuous variable.

350
00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:26.449
Tian WU: And also, we can use this box plot to have

351
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:32.309
Tian WU: An intuitive understanding of the distribution of the data points.

352
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:40.200
Tian WU: For example, we know that there are some extreme values on the… on the large value.

353
00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.690
Tian WU: So there must be certain extreme values.

354
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.699
Tian WU: For… for large values.

355
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.100
Tian WU: Correspondingly, on the left-hand side, I plot the histogram.

356
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:59.800
Tian WU: Which… Divide the range of this dataset into different intervals.

357
00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:06.559
Tian WU: and then I count the number of Values fall into different intervals.

358
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:18.080
Tian WU: So, for example, here, I think this is around 0.3, so from 0.3 to 1.2, For… for the value.

359
00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:23.099
Tian WU: In our data falls into that interval.

360
00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:29.950
Tian WU: we count the number of values. Say, in total, there are 16 such values.

361
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.090
Tian WU: Then we have a, a bar.

362
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:35.260
Tian WU: Here.

363
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:44.180
Tian WU: And then we count the number of, values falls between one point 2 to 2.1.

364
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:50.120
Tian WU: And it turns out that there are 6 of them, so we have the second bar, so on and so forth.

365
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:57.419
Tian WU: And it is indeed that we found there is a bar, so there are 3 values.

366
00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:03.990
Tian WU: falls between, like, 3.8 to 4.7.

367
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.660
Tian WU: So there are, three values.

368
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:11.410
Tian WU: Which are really large.

369
00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:17.129
Tian WU: So that corresponds to this outliers on this box plot.

370
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:29.640
Tian WU: And also, we can pay attention to the distance between Q1 and median versus the distance between median versus Q3.

371
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.010
Tian WU: We know that in this box.

372
00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.979
Tian WU: There are 50% of the data.

373
00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.460
Tian WU: Right, the middle 50% of the data.

374
00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:49.389
Tian WU: But for the lower 25%, Their range is relatively small.

375
00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.539
Tian WU: Compared to the range of the other 25%.

376
00:46:55.790 --> 00:47:01.050
Tian WU: So this means that Starting from this median level.

377
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:07.250
Tian WU: The range of the next 25% of the data is Bone.

378
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.560
Tian WU: Larger.

379
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.470
Tian WU: Compared to the previous 25%.

380
00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:21.940
Tian WU: So… If we look back into the histogram, this is reflected as a,

381
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.879
Tian WU: sliding. It's like a slide shape in this histogram.

382
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:32.330
Tian WU: So on the left-hand side, the distance is relatively short.

383
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:38.720
Tian WU: Whereas, on the right-hand side, the, the distance is…

384
00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:42.550
Tian WU: It's larger for same 25% of the data.

385
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:48.359
Tian WU: So you would imagine that if we can, have more data.

386
00:47:48.910 --> 00:48:02.139
Tian WU: So that the histogram will become smoother, then here will be a, here will be a, peak, and then gradually the shape will slide down.

387
00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.659
Tian WU: And given that there are some

388
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:09.919
Tian WU: Large values on the right-hand side, there will be a long tail.

389
00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.840
Tian WU: Extending to the right.

390
00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:21.400
Tian WU: So with the tail on the right-hand side, this is called a scale to the right shape of the distribution of this dataset.

391
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.279
Tian WU: So roughly, we can see from this, box plot.

392
00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.820
Tian WU: About, whether there's an outlier.

393
00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:39.209
Tian WU: And the range of most of the data, and also, somehow, the distribution of the data points.

394
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:48.040
Tian WU: I think this shape is a bit like when we discussed about the, the salary…

395
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.680
Tian WU: So we know that, there are many super-rich people in Hong Kong.

396
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.909
Tian WU: And if we calculate the average salary of all the people in Hong Kong.

397
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:05.199
Tian WU: The average will be inflated because of those very rich people.

398
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:06.360
Tian WU: Right.

399
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:14.700
Tian WU: So, the mean value, the average salary, will be… Extract to the right.

400
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:17.800
Tian WU: Due to those very rich people.

401
00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.560
Tian WU: But for most of the people, if we consider about the median.

402
00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:31.099
Tian WU: The median level of the salary, like, 50% of the people, their salary will be less than this amount.

403
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.760
Tian WU: And the remaining 50th percent will be greater than that amount.

404
00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:39.590
Tian WU: So this… Media will be…

405
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:48.860
Tian WU: Smaller than the average, than the mean value, if there are some very large value on the right-hand side.

406
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:55.179
Tian WU: Because median is not that sensitive to the extreme values.

407
00:49:55.730 --> 00:50:03.399
Tian WU: or the outliers, because it's considered the center. It cuts the data points, in the middle.

408
00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:10.739
Tian WU: Whereas for the mean value, when we calculate mean, we need to Sum over all the points.

409
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:18.329
Tian WU: The value of all the points in all the data points, and then divide it by the total number of data points.

410
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:25.110
Tian WU: Then, this mean value will be, Dragged to the right.

411
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:31.940
Tian WU: because of these extremely large values. So we observe this mean value sitting

412
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:35.740
Tian WU: At the right-hand side of the median value.

413
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:40.520
Tian WU: Or if you translate to the box plot, then it is above.

414
00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.160
Tian WU: The, median value.

415
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:53.749
Tian WU: So hopefully, with this example, you have a better understanding of this box and whisker plot.

416
00:50:53.890 --> 00:51:02.419
Tian WU: And, you could use all this visualization under appropriate circumstances.

417
00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:13.779
Tian WU: Okay, I think maybe we take a 10-minute break, and if you have any questions, you can just send message in the chat box.

418
00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:32.970
Simon Wang: So while we're taking a break, if anyone cannot have access to the Google Drive folder I shared in the individual WhatsApp group, just send your Gmail account to the group.

419
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:44.679
Simon Wang: And you know, actually your group members should be able to help you, invite you over to the folder, but you need my help, you can also, tag me and let me know.

420
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.820
Simon Wang: And also, if you,

421
00:51:54.940 --> 00:52:11.580
Simon Wang: need help regarding the API key, also let us know. I think after, you know, after the break, Talia will talk a bit more about simulation, and then we're going to, have the in-class, exercise.

422
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:17.759
Simon Wang: And I'm going to set up some breakout room, so the…

423
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:29.530
Simon Wang: group members of each group can go to the breakout room, and, you can talk there, you can actually have a meeting about your project while you're doing the in-class exercise. So…

424
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:35.089
Simon Wang: Because next week, we're going to have small group meetings,

425
00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:40.750
Simon Wang: We're going to provide more instructions in terms of the arrangement, But,

426
00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:52.289
Simon Wang: Next week will be very critical, because you need to make some progress over the… over your own project, and you have to decide how you want to approach the government to collect information.

427
00:52:52.320 --> 00:53:04.520
Simon Wang: So, and also this is the week before the public holiday, and you want to think about how you want to collect your data. So, so a lot of decisions will have to be made,

428
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.750
Simon Wang: Hopefully before or during.

429
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:21.130
Simon Wang: the group meetings next week. So I think we need to kind of… in addition to learning about the models, we need to start thinking about how to apply the models and tools to our projects.

430
00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:01.610
Simon Wang: Right, another quick, message about, about Gihub.

431
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:19.009
Simon Wang: is that since you already took some time and efforts to learn about GitHub, VS Code, and everything, I would encourage you to actually apply for the GitHub education, because, once you

432
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:29.250
Simon Wang: get the GitHub education, eligibility, you will be able to enjoy some, GitHub Copilot Agent

433
00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:40.990
Simon Wang: services, which is usually premium services that you have to pay, but if you've got student benefits, then you can use it a little bit more for free.

434
00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.420
Simon Wang: At some point, we're going to talk about that.

435
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:50.509
Simon Wang: Well, we don't want to overwhelm you with all kinds of technical,

436
00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:56.400
Simon Wang: details, but, I think the agent is going to,

437
00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:09.520
Simon Wang: you know, give you a lot of, opportunities and, you know, help. So I would encourage you to look into that, but you have to apply for the education benefit first.

438
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:03.529
Tian WU: Okay, so maybe let's resume.

439
01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:14.759
Tian WU: So Simon just mentioned about the GitHub education. If you log in into your GitHub account under this Billing and Licensing.

440
01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:29.480
Tian WU: education benefits, you can go to this GitHub education page to submit an application. So on average, it will take around 5 days to process your application.

441
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:44.310
Tian WU: Okay, so regarding this box and whisker plot, if you ask the AI's help to generate this plot based on certain data, then the plot will be directly out.

442
01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:48.189
Tian WU: So you don't have to actually consider all of these details.

443
01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:56.480
Tian WU: But the reason I explain it is to hopefully help you to have a better understanding of how this is plotted out.

444
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.390
Tian WU: And another point is that if you would like to change the setting of the code.

445
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:11.630
Tian WU: Say, if you want to plot 30 data points, generate 30 data points rather than 26,

446
01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:18.970
Tian WU: Of course, you can tell the AI assistant to help you to modify the code.

447
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:24.790
Tian WU: And you actually don't have to copy and paste, because there is apply to this notebook.

448
01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:31.970
Tian WU: So once you click this, So the corresponding, code will be

449
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:47.650
Tian WU: modified automatically, so you can see the old version with 26, and the new version with 30. So just click keep, if you think everything's fine, just click keep, so that it saves you the copy and paste. You can

450
01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:53.650
Tian WU: Directly apply the modified code to the old version of the code.

451
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:56.540
Tian WU: Okay, so this is a tip.

452
01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.560
Tian WU: Okay.

453
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:06.970
Tian WU: So then, I still have some last words about the, requestion?

454
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:12.310
Tian WU: Yup.

455
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:30.710
Tian WU: So last time, we mainly talked about the linear regression, and our purpose is to try to use our data to estimate the values for this beta zero, this intercept, and the slope term, the beta 1.

456
01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:38.909
Tian WU: And that is the case when the response is a continuous response.

457
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.250
Tian WU: Which means Y should be a continuous variable.

458
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.860
Tian WU: But in reality, it is not always the case, right?

459
01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:58.259
Tian WU: In our questionnaire, the response variable is actually categorical, from the strongly opposed to strongly support.

460
01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:15.250
Tian WU: In that case, it is not that appropriate to apply the linear regression, because it already violates one of the assumptions of the linear regression for distribution of the Y, or for this error term.

461
01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.929
Tian WU: So, based on different types of responsible variable.

462
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.930
Tian WU: If the response variable is binary.

463
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:27.119
Tian WU: Like, when it can only take value of 0 or 1,

464
01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:36.270
Tian WU: We will have the so-called logistic regression, And if Y is categorical, Especially…

465
01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:41.329
Tian WU: It's an ordinal categorical response, just like

466
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.539
Tian WU: in our questionnaire is from strongly opposed to strongly support

467
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:50.670
Tian WU: Then it is more appropriate to use the ordinal regression.

468
01:04:51.850 --> 01:05:02.090
Tian WU: Because not all of you will, will make use of, regression, because, as mentioned, regression is only,

469
01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:12.659
Tian WU: Appropriate to be used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, assuming a linear relationship.

470
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:15.550
Tian WU: So if the question type is.

471
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:26.029
Tian WU: We want to explore the relationship between the response and some potential influence of factors, then linear regression might be a useful tool.

472
01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:28.880
Tian WU: But not all of you will use this.

473
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:40.689
Tian WU: So I will not, spend more time to talk more about the details of logistic regression and the ordinary logistic regression.

474
01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:50.780
Tian WU: But later, if your group project will make use of regression models, then we can, in a small group.

475
01:05:51.060 --> 01:06:03.579
Tian WU: I will talk more about this, correct interpretation of the, the parameters for logistic regression and ordinary logistic regression model.

476
01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:08.449
Tian WU: So that's the final words for the regression models.

477
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.569
Tian WU: And then, finally, we can start with the simulation.

478
01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.799
Tian WU: So this is our second,

479
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.580
Tian WU: This is our second case study.

480
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:34.389
Tian WU: The topic is to evaluate the efficiency of the bus road adjustments. City bus number 56.

481
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.290
Tian WU: Thanks.

482
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:38.720
Tian WU: So here comes the structure of the case study.

483
01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:47.819
Tian WU: We'll first briefly talk about the background of this proposal of adjusting the bus frequency and road.

484
01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:52.860
Tian WU: And also, briefly introduce the simulation design.

485
01:06:53.370 --> 01:07:09.450
Tian WU: And look into the random component in the simulation, and how we interpret the results, and correspondingly, how this study will help generate certain questions that we can acquire with the transport department.

486
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.739
Tian WU: Then we will have the in-class exercise.

487
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:17.320
Tian WU: So, background.

488
01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:25.450
Tian WU: Actually, every year, this is an annual exercise for the franchise, the bus companies.

489
01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:30.750
Tian WU: to submit these bus road planning programs to the Transport Department.

490
01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:38.299
Tian WU: So… Do you know how many, franchise the bus companies in Hong Kong

491
01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:45.199
Tian WU: You can type in the chat box.

492
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.960
Tian WU: 2?

493
01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:03.819
Tian WU: Actually, there are 4 bus companies. So the franchise, the buses, including the city bus, the Colon Motor Bus.

494
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:12.139
Tian WU: Long Wind Bus and New Lentell Bus. In total, there are 4 franchise bus companies in Hong Kong.

495
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:18.270
Tian WU: And after they proposed this road change to the Transport Department.

496
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:24.079
Tian WU: The department will review the proposal and consult with relevant district councils.

497
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:31.099
Tian WU: Particularly for major changes, because that will affect the residents in the district.

498
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:38.419
Tian WU: So they will, consult the, district councils, About the adjustment.

499
01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:45.159
Tian WU: Then, this proposal will be implemented, often begins on a temporary basis.

500
01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:52.100
Tian WU: Following up to 24 months of operation without permanent legislative changes.

501
01:08:53.359 --> 01:09:02.939
Tian WU: And if this change is determined to be a permanent change, Then, legislative procedures are required.

502
01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:08.349
Tian WU: When the road changes need to be made permanent beyond the 24 months temporary period.

503
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:19.019
Tian WU: So that's the overall flow of… from proposing the road change to, finally, we have certain legislative procedures.

504
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:26.030
Tian WU: And in our case study, we will focus on city bus number 56,

505
01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:30.369
Tian WU: So it is, operating in the North District.

506
01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:40.009
Tian WU: So you can actually find that this, proposal is discussed in the committee meetings in the, North District Council.

507
01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:48.770
Tian WU: And in this proposal, it states the criteria for increasing the buzz frequency.

508
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:57.889
Tian WU: Specifically, our case is, cited from the 2024 to 2005.

509
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.529
Tian WU: This bus road planning program.

510
01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:10.310
Tian WU: It says that for individual bus roads, if the passenger load factor reaches 90% during the busiest half hour.

511
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:15.739
Tian WU: And 75% during the busiest hour of peak periods.

512
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:23.300
Tian WU: Or 60% during the busiest hour of off-peak periods.

513
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:31.189
Tian WU: Then, the department and the franchise, the bus company, will consider increasing the service frequency.

514
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:37.379
Tian WU: So this is written as the criteria for increasing bus frequency.

515
01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:42.210
Tian WU: But… I think…

516
01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:51.899
Tian WU: here, sorry that I cannot find the Chinese version of this, this proposal. It seems that only the traditional Chinese version is provided.

517
01:10:52.450 --> 01:11:01.909
Tian WU: But for this 56, Regarding the, capacity of passengers, It says that in the

518
01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:09.220
Tian WU: In the busiest one hour, The passenger load factor is 32%.

519
01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:12.690
Tian WU: So this is before the adjustment.

520
01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:23.520
Tian WU: They will make, adjustment of the frequency of 56, so that the existing capacity.

521
01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:25.500
Tian WU: will be improved.

522
01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:31.489
Tian WU: But it's a little bit weird that we found that for this bus number 56,

523
01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:38.860
Tian WU: Even before the adjustment, the so-called passenger load factor is only 32%.

524
01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.709
Tian WU: So then that leads to the question.

525
01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.060
Tian WU: It is unclear, first of all, it is unclear how is this passenger load factor is defined.

526
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.669
Tian WU: So if we only consider those, stating passengers.

527
01:11:56.890 --> 01:12:00.099
Tian WU: Then that will be the seed utilization rate.

528
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.949
Tian WU: Like, we use the number of people.

529
01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:04.770
Tian WU: on the bus.

530
01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:10.670
Tian WU: Divided by the capacity, or the number of seats on the bus.

531
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.170
Tian WU: Then we can have this, seed utilization rate.

532
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.759
Tian WU: Or, it can be, like, we use the number of people on the bus.

533
01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:25.320
Tian WU: To divide the total capacity of a bus.

534
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:29.589
Tian WU: Including… In those standing spots.

535
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:36.430
Tian WU: So then, in this proposal, it is not clear exactly how this passenger load factor is defined.

536
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.820
Tian WU: Which way?

537
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:39.760
Tian WU: This is calculated.

538
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:47.520
Tian WU: And specifically, for this number 56, when the business hour occurs.

539
01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:52.099
Tian WU: So I bet for a different, bus road.

540
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:54.780
Tian WU: The busiest hour will be different.

541
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:57.959
Tian WU: Right, but it is not listed here.

542
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:07.210
Tian WU: It only lists the, the frequency of the bus during the busiest hour, but it does not mention when exactly the busiest hour occurs.

543
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:15.629
Tian WU: Also, we only have one single number for this passenger load factor.

544
01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.450
Tian WU: And we… by imagination, we… we… we can…

545
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:24.399
Tian WU: We can see that for different stops.

546
01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.539
Tian WU: The seed utilization rate will be different.

547
01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:35.009
Tian WU: Say, for those bus stops, which are near the MTR station.

548
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:39.130
Tian WU: If it is before the MTR station, I would expect that

549
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:42.189
Tian WU: The seed utilization rate will be high because

550
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:53.050
Tian WU: I would bet people taking this bus to go to the MTR station. And after the bus arrives at the MTR station, people get off the bus.

551
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:56.729
Tian WU: And then the seed utilization rate will decrease.

552
01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:01.549
Tian WU: So for every stop, these numbers should be different.

553
01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.319
Tian WU: And also, For different time period.

554
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:09.300
Tian WU: As is mentioned, there are business hours, right?

555
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:15.729
Tian WU: So for different hours, these… Seat utility rate… utilization rate should be different.

556
01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:22.280
Tian WU: Say, during the morning hours, during the lunch hours, It should be certain variation.

557
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:26.800
Tian WU: So then, how exactly this single number is calculated?

558
01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.259
Tian WU: is not clear.

559
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:34.239
Tian WU: And also, how an increase in bus frequency is justified.

560
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:39.429
Tian WU: Given… These percentages is very low, actually.

561
01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:47.939
Tian WU: Comparing to the criteria in the same document, it says… it says that When this number reaches…

562
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:56.409
Tian WU: 90%, then the company and also the transport department will consider increasing the service frequency.

563
01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.690
Tian WU: There are many questions.

564
01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.270
Tian WU: After we reach this proposal.

565
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:11.640
Tian WU: So specifically, Originally, the, city bus number 56, the road is from

566
01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:18.230
Tian WU: the road is the, the… represented by the blue line. Blue… blue curve.

567
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.150
Tian WU: So this is from… turn on to so-and-so.

568
01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:28.520
Tian WU: this blue… Curve.

569
01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:35.740
Tian WU: And it turns out that In addition to the frequency change, the rate of this, this,

570
01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:38.160
Tian WU: Buzz also changed.

571
01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:43.989
Tian WU: So now it is the, the rotis represented by this red dashed line.

572
01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:52.360
Tian WU: So, visually, it's the distance of the, overall overall distance is increasing.

573
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:58.439
Tian WU: So we can see some key summaries of the

574
01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.130
Tian WU: Of this bus before and after the adjustment.

575
01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.959
Tian WU: So before, the, adjustment…

576
01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:20.280
Tian WU: The total distance for the forward direction from Timmun to Shenzhou is 26.9 kilometers, whereas after adjustment, the distance is longer.

577
01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:28.239
Tian WU: Whereas for the service time, it is increased by adding this afternoon to night session.

578
01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.159
Tian WU: Plus the weekends.

579
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.730
Tian WU: And the hard way, which is the frequency of the bus.

580
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:43.250
Tian WU: So, previously, before adjustment, in one hour, there will be 30, there will be 2 buses.

581
01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:53.320
Tian WU: Whereas for the proposed change, which is now, in action, it's like in one hour, in the morning sessions.

582
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:56.169
Tian WU: There will be 3 buses in 1 hour.

583
01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:02.240
Tian WU: Although the road is different, the number of stops is kept the same.

584
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:08.079
Tian WU: Whereas for the return direction, the overall distance increased.

585
01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:10.909
Tian WU: The overall service time is increased.

586
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:16.139
Tian WU: Like, adding the, afternoon and night session, plus the weekends.

587
01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:21.120
Tian WU: The frequency is kept the same, and the number of stops increased.

588
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:25.909
Tian WU: So that's the overall, background for this bus.

589
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:38.550
Tian WU: And our objective is to develop and analyze a simulation of the bus road 56 operations during the morning.

590
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:43.200
Tian WU: Using field data, and also the estimated arrival times.

591
01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.720
Tian WU: It's called ETA, from the Data Gulf of Hong Kong.

592
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:54.300
Tian WU: So pay attention that this bus starts service after 9.

593
01:17:54.880 --> 01:18:00.440
Tian WU: So I think this is already different from the peak hour we usually define.

594
01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:11.080
Tian WU: If we consider when the students go to school and people go to work, then usually the peak hour will be, like, from 7, or even from half past 6.

595
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:15.179
Tian WU: But for this boss, It does operate.

596
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.690
Tian WU: ads.

597
01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:19.220
Tian WU: At least after 9 o'clock.

598
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:29.079
Tian WU: So we want to test, with the change of the frequency and also the bus route.

599
01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:34.929
Tian WU: How would this seat utilization rate change using the simulation method?

600
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:42.380
Tian WU: And then we can provide the evidence-based policy inquiries to the transport department.

601
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.960
Tian WU: So recall that, we introduced this

602
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:56.409
Tian WU: If you have any comments, you can maybe type in the chat box.

603
01:18:58.310 --> 01:19:03.209
Tian WU: So we talked about this simulation design in the, first class.

604
01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:10.639
Tian WU: We said there are two tools will be introduced. The first is simulation design, and the second is regression.

605
01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:20.520
Tian WU: So, simulation is about mimicking complex systems, Normally, over time, using logic, Maths and computers.

606
01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:26.520
Tian WU: So today, we will have a, kind of, intuitive understanding of what this means.

607
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:40.239
Tian WU: And simulation is an experimental process. We run and rerun the model many times under different scenarios to predict the system behavior and evaluate performance under each scenario.

608
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:46.299
Tian WU: Previously, I have shown this, simulation visualization.

609
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:51.330
Tian WU: So, we have the, clock, which is…

610
01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:55.790
Tian WU: Record… which is recording the time passed by.

611
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:59.820
Tian WU: And say, at 9-10, the first bus set out.

612
01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:03.649
Tian WU: And for each station, there will be passengers queuing.

613
01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:19.959
Tian WU: And of course, we will have the passengers alight the bus, so the number of passengers on the bus will not keep increasing. So at some point, the number of passengers on the bus will decrease.

614
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:28.069
Tian WU: So this is the, visualization of the simulation. So we can have a real-time

615
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:36.650
Tian WU: calculation of the utilization rate by different bus stops. So this will keep changing with the clock time past.

616
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:42.939
Tian WU: So then, let's see how this is, implemented.

617
01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:55.990
Tian WU: So, in our simulation, There are 3 random components.

618
01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:09.359
Tian WU: And this will, these three random components will affect, the seed utilization rate, which is the KPI we focus for this

619
01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:10.570
Tian WU: Simulation.

620
01:21:13.210 --> 01:21:20.520
Tian WU: So to calculate the seat utilization rate, we need to count the passengers on bus at each stop.

621
01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:21.980
Tian WU: Right.

622
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:29.160
Tian WU: But this number is affected by this three components.

623
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:34.419
Tian WU: The first is the travel time between each pair of stops.

624
01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:41.200
Tian WU: So I said here, the travel time between each pair of stops is random.

625
01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:50.390
Tian WU: This means that if we observe the bus, Starting from stop A, driving to stop B,

626
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:56.950
Tian WU: This time will be different if we observe it in different time… at different times.

627
01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.709
Tian WU: So for day one, I…

628
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:07.620
Tian WU: I use a clock to, record the traveling time from A to B. It's 10 minutes.

629
01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:13.090
Tian WU: And for day 2, it might be 10 minutes plus 30 seconds.

630
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:19.450
Tian WU: And the next day, the day 3, will be 9 minutes and 45 seconds.

631
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:30.089
Tian WU: So every time when we try to measure the traveling time between each pair of the stops, it will be slightly different. It is not a constant.

632
01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:35.610
Tian WU: So in this case, we can say that this component is ran…

633
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:39.299
Tian WU: So for those, say, traffic jams.

634
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:45.449
Tian WU: then the travel time between stop A and B will be very, very long.

635
01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:53.989
Tian WU: Right? Whereas, if for one day, if the driver, drives the bus, Very fast. Then…

636
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.340
Tian WU: The traveling time will be quite short.

637
01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:04.310
Tian WU: And this time will also affect the number of people waiting at the stop B.

638
01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:23.619
Tian WU: Suppose there is a traffic jam, so it takes super long time to drive from A, stop A to stop B, then we would expect that the number of passengers waiting at stop B will be more than the usual case.

639
01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:29.430
Tian WU: When the buzz just, Drive in an ordinary speed.

640
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:36.129
Tian WU: So, the number of waiting passengers at stop B is also random.

641
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:43.389
Tian WU: And also, at each stop, the number of passengers getting off is also random.

642
01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:50.460
Tian WU: So, say if we, take that bus, and we take that bus for several times.

643
01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:55.280
Tian WU: We count the number of people who get off at bus stop B.

644
01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:04.770
Tian WU: But every time this number will be slightly different, it cannot be… always be the constant, like, every time it's 5 people who are getting off.

645
01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:10.290
Tian WU: Usually, there will be certain variation, like, 3 people today.

646
01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:15.489
Tian WU: 5 people next day, 4 people on day 3, something like that.

647
01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:25.780
Tian WU: And actually, for this random component, we can use the random variables to describe their behaviors.

648
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.439
Tian WU: So first, it's about the travel time.

649
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:39.110
Tian WU: The bus travel time between each pair of the stops is modeled as a random variable.

650
01:24:39.330 --> 01:24:41.940
Tian WU: Drawn from a normal distribution.

651
01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:51.320
Tian WU: So we know for normal distribution, It's a bell-shaped, It's symmetric.

652
01:24:51.730 --> 01:25:03.960
Tian WU: And the probability that the, if we regard the, maybe let me… That me… A lot.

653
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:09.399
Tian WU: Let me change the device.

654
01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:31.569
Tian WU: Okay, so for normal distribution, Suppose this is time t.

655
01:25:32.850 --> 01:25:36.540
Tian WU: This is… F15.

656
01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:46.569
Tian WU: So this, travel time, we regard it, follows a normal distribution.

657
01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:52.659
Tian WU: Say the traveling time from stop A and stop B On average, it's 10 minutes.

658
01:25:53.930 --> 01:26:00.100
Tian WU: So the probability that the traveling time is between Baby.

659
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.209
Tian WU: Between here and here.

660
01:26:07.210 --> 01:26:11.290
Tian WU: So suppose this is, like, 9.

661
01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.560
Tian WU: 2… This is 10.8 minutes.

662
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:25.499
Tian WU: The probability that the traveling time is between 9.2 to 10.8 minutes the… the probability.

663
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.579
Tian WU: is very high. So you can see the area is very large.

664
01:26:30.370 --> 01:26:37.739
Tian WU: Compared to the case where the driving time between, say, 11 to 12,

665
01:26:38.650 --> 01:26:41.580
Tian WU: Then this variability is very small.

666
01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:48.770
Tian WU: So we can use this, normal distribution to…

667
01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:56.709
Tian WU: to describe the traveling time. So most of the time, the traveling time will be between, say, 9.2 to

668
01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.590
Tian WU: 10.8.

669
01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:03.829
Tian WU: Then, with the mean, which is the 10 minute here.

670
01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:18.140
Tian WU: And the standard deviation, so suppose this represents the, 3 standard deviation. Here is 0.8, then I have roughly, this is, like, 0.2…

671
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:19.150
Tian WU: Sixth?

672
01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.780
Tian WU: Right.

673
01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.710
Tian WU: So I have this standard deviation, Estimated from sample data.

674
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:38.950
Tian WU: Specifically, we use the API, we can collect the estimated time of arrival.

675
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:44.639
Tian WU: At each stop for 30 trips of bus number 56.

676
01:27:45.490 --> 01:27:54.340
Tian WU: So I know… from this, ETA data, so this is the real-time, arrival time.

677
01:27:55.690 --> 01:28:02.509
Tian WU: a record the number it takes from stop A to stop B for 30 times.

678
01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:11.719
Tian WU: And I use the average of the travel time of the 30 times as the mean.

679
01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:14.969
Tian WU: Of my normal distribution.

680
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:26.270
Tian WU: And I also use the standard deviation of this 30, traveling times as the standard deviation of my normal distribution.

681
01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:35.989
Tian WU: So then, in each simulation, I can draw a random number from this specific normal distribution.

682
01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:40.089
Tian WU: as the travel time from stop A to stop B.

683
01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.489
Tian WU: So every time, the travel time will be different.

684
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:49.759
Tian WU: Because it is drawn from a normal distribution.

685
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.600
Tian WU: But they are drawn from the same distribution.

686
01:28:52.750 --> 01:29:01.439
Tian WU: Where the mean and standard deviation is estimated based on, the, Via real-time data.

687
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:10.660
Tian WU: And then, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of travel times between each pair of stops.

688
01:29:11.890 --> 01:29:17.169
Tian WU: For each simulation run, we sample travel times from the corresponding normal distributions.

689
01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.380
Tian WU: To represent the bus travel times between stops.

690
01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:26.160
Tian WU: So if there are different pair of stops.

691
01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:34.580
Tian WU: So for this pair of stops, each time I will draw a, travel time, from…

692
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:42.020
Tian WU: A normal distribution with same mean equals to 10, variance equals to 0.3.

693
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:47.980
Tian WU: Whereas for the next pair of bus stops.

694
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:54.920
Tian WU: Because the distance between these two might be different from the previous pair of stations.

695
01:29:55.340 --> 01:30:02.700
Tian WU: So, I may need to draw the traveling time from a normal distribution with, say, mean value 15.

696
01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:06.430
Tian WU: And 0.2, something like that.

697
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:10.840
Tian WU: So for each pair of There's bus stops.

698
01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:15.600
Tian WU: I would draw this travel time from normal distribution

699
01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:21.949
Tian WU: whose mean and standard deviation is estimated from the ETA data.

700
01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:34.410
Tian WU: If we implement it in code, it will be, the random.normal. We use numpy mp.random.normal.

701
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:43.709
Tian WU: These command will help us to draw the random numbers from normal distribution with specific mean and specific standard deviation.

702
01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:49.610
Tian WU: So after we know the traveling time.

703
01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:52.200
Tian WU: Between each pair of the bus stops.

704
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:57.629
Tian WU: And we know that this will affect the number of waiting passengers at stop B.

705
01:30:58.450 --> 01:31:05.549
Tian WU: Because, as mentioned, the longer the traveling time, the larger number of waiting passengers.

706
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:16.909
Tian WU: And this number of waiting passengers is often used… is often described by this so-called poison distribution.

707
01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:25.040
Tian WU: So Poisson distribution is a discrete distribution.

708
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:32.279
Tian WU: So it can only take… It can only take value, like, 0 or 1 or 2 or 3.

709
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:42.140
Tian WU: And it can be used to describe the number of events happened within a unit's time interval.

710
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:49.579
Tian WU: Say, we want to describe the number of passengers, waiting at a stop.

711
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:57.930
Tian WU: Or the number of customers go into a supermarket, So this is… about counting.

712
01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.460
Tian WU: The number of events happened.

713
01:32:01.890 --> 01:32:08.979
Tian WU: And if we know that it follows a poison distribution, then one of the key parameters

714
01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:15.580
Tian WU: So parameter is just like the mean and standard deviation for a normal distribution.

715
01:32:16.230 --> 01:32:20.609
Tian WU: For poison distribution, the key parameter is lambda.

716
01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:26.960
Tian WU: It represents the average number of occurrence in the time interval.

717
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:37.900
Tian WU: So suppose we know that if lambda equals to 4, It means, on average, In one hour.

718
01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:42.320
Tian WU: There will be 4 people waiting at bus stop.

719
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:50.709
Tian WU: Then, we can calculate the corresponding probability when there is, like, only

720
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:55.780
Tian WU: Zero people waiting at the bus stop.

721
01:32:55.990 --> 01:33:00.660
Tian WU: Then we know the average number is 4, then…

722
01:33:01.810 --> 01:33:05.570
Tian WU: If we calculate the probability of zero passengers.

723
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:10.200
Tian WU: Or waiting at that bus stop, the corresponding probability will be very low.

724
01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:18.959
Tian WU: And it is also, makes sense that if the average number of passengers waiting at the bus stop

725
01:33:19.190 --> 01:33:25.160
Tian WU: Within the unit time, interval is 4, then the probability that

726
01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:36.100
Tian WU: During that time interval, there will be 5 people who are waiting at the bus stop. The probability of this event will be relatively high.

727
01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:41.000
Tian WU: Because… On average, there will be 4 people waiting there.

728
01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:47.990
Tian WU: And 5 people is close to… to the average, close to the… Four people.

729
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:57.099
Tian WU: So then the chance of There are 5 people waiting there, this probability should be relatively high.

730
01:33:57.570 --> 01:34:00.690
Tian WU: So you can observe this, graph.

731
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:09.349
Tian WU: When the average is 4, then the probability of 5 people waiting there is relatively high, whereas

732
01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:14.010
Tian WU: If we know, on average, there will be 4 people waiting there.

733
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:18.890
Tian WU: The probability that there will be 20 people waiting there, then…

734
01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:24.340
Tian WU: The likelihood of this event will be relatively small.

735
01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:29.039
Tian WU: So that is the shape of this poison distribution.

736
01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:38.329
Tian WU: And then… Just like what we did for the traveling time, we need to estimate the lambda.

737
01:34:38.670 --> 01:34:43.910
Tian WU: The average number of people waiting at different bus stops.

738
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:48.969
Tian WU: And this can be estimated by the field observation.

739
01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.430
Tian WU: Say, now we are at the bus stop 2.

740
01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:58.579
Tian WU: And suppose, imagine that we are on the bus, Starting from stop 1.

741
01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:01.569
Tian WU: We start to see how long it takes

742
01:35:01.700 --> 01:35:06.730
Tian WU: To drive from stop 1 to stop 2, And it turns out that

743
01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:09.329
Tian WU: The travel time is 10 minutes.

744
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:13.460
Tian WU: And at stop 2, there are 5 people waiting there.

745
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:16.680
Tian WU: This is our first observation.

746
01:35:17.690 --> 01:35:21.239
Tian WU: Then, for the next day, or for the next shift.

747
01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:27.589
Tian WU: The traveling time between stop 1 and stop 2 is 15 minutes.

748
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:33.310
Tian WU: And then we observe there are 8 people. We are waiting at stop 2.

749
01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:37.040
Tian WU: So we have a record, so on and so forth.

750
01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:41.109
Tian WU: So after we collected this field data.

751
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:45.390
Tian WU: We can calculate the rate for each observation.

752
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:53.530
Tian WU: So the rate represents the average number of passengers In the time interval.

753
01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:02.380
Tian WU: So you may imagine that the passengers just come, In a uniformly way.

754
01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:07.260
Tian WU: So during this 10 minutes, In total, there are 5 people.

755
01:36:08.170 --> 01:36:12.369
Tian WU: Catch the… Arrive at stop 2.

756
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:20.410
Tian WU: So this means, on average, for every minute, There are 0.5 people.

757
01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:22.719
Tian WU: Arrived at the stop tool.

758
01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:28.969
Tian WU: Similarly, we can calculate this arrival rate

759
01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:32.400
Tian WU: For, the next few observations.

760
01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:36.860
Tian WU: And then we can take average of these rates

761
01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:44.109
Tian WU: As an estimate of the average number of passengers waiting at stop 2.

762
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:52.270
Tian WU: Say, if we only have these 4 observations on average, for every minute.

763
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:57.510
Tian WU: 0.51 passengers will arrive at Stock 2.

764
01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.269
Tian WU: And with this estimation, for each time of the simulation.

765
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.689
Tian WU: We can draw a random number of passengers.

766
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:14.399
Tian WU: from a Poisson distribution with lambda equals to this 0.5.

767
01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:22.349
Tian WU: But, of course, we need to time the, time interval of the traveling time.

768
01:37:22.810 --> 01:37:28.679
Tian WU: So this lambda rate is… per minute, How many passengers will come?

769
01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:37.129
Tian WU: And these need to be multiplied by the time interval of traveling from stop 1 to stop 2.

770
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.940
Tian WU: So this is about how we,

771
01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.370
Tian WU: Simulate the number of waiting passengers.

772
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:53.879
Tian WU: And then… the passengers must get off somewhere, right? They cannot, like, stay in the bus forever.

773
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:59.950
Tian WU: There is another distribution, which is called the binomial distribution.

774
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:05.369
Tian WU: That can be used to describe the number of passengers getting off at each stop.

775
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:10.650
Tian WU: So for this distribution, you may just regard it as

776
01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:16.750
Tian WU: If we flip a coin for several times, say, 20 times.

777
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:23.029
Tian WU: And we care the number of times that we get a hassle.

778
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:24.920
Tian WU: It gets a heads up.

779
01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:30.179
Tian WU: So, say, I do the experiment, I flip a fair coin for 20 times.

780
01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:35.830
Tian WU: Then, for this experiment, it turns out that there are 8 Coins.

781
01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:37.610
Tian WU: That are heads up.

782
01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:40.690
Tian WU: So this is one observation.

783
01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:44.389
Tian WU: And we can repeat this experiment.

784
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:51.889
Tian WU: And the event that we are interested is the number of Heads up, off the coin.

785
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:59.649
Tian WU: And we record the number of heads up in the sequence of, flip, this coin flipping.

786
01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:07.900
Tian WU: So here, you may just regard those passengers who get off as the coin has a heads up.

787
01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:17.159
Tian WU: So we just… Regarding the total number of coin flipping as the number of people on the bus.

788
01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.650
Tian WU: And then we count how many people get off.

789
01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:27.490
Tian WU: So the number of get-offs is the event that we are interested.

790
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:29.279
Tian WU: And then…

791
01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:39.270
Tian WU: The difference between the coin flipping and the passengers get off is that we know for a fair coin.

792
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:44.199
Tian WU: The probability of having a heads-up is 50%.

793
01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:45.640
Tian WU: Right.

794
01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.690
Tian WU: But here, we actually don't know.

795
01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:52.080
Tian WU: How many percent of the people will get off?

796
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:58.309
Tian WU: And this probability will be different for different stops.

797
01:39:59.230 --> 01:40:11.350
Tian WU: say, for those stops that are near the MTR station, then it's more likely that the passenger will get off at that station, because they want to take MTR.

798
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:15.010
Tian WU: Whereas for those small stations, then…

799
01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.210
Tian WU: Overall, the number of people who get off the bus will be… will be

800
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:23.090
Tian WU: Will be fewer, will be smaller, right?

801
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:32.720
Tian WU: So then we can estimate the probability of getting off for each stop, again, using the field data.

802
01:40:34.650 --> 01:40:42.260
Tian WU: So we collect data over several days or weeks, and again, we have certain observations for the specific stop.

803
01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:47.559
Tian WU: So for stop 2, originally there are 10 people on the bus.

804
01:40:47.710 --> 01:40:50.450
Tian WU: And it turns out that 4 of them are light.

805
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.049
Tian WU: For the next observation, in total, there are 12 people Riding on the bus.

806
01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:01.300
Tian WU: And at stop 2, 5 of them are light.

807
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:03.359
Tian WU: So on and so forth.

808
01:41:04.130 --> 01:41:07.229
Tian WU: So we can use these observations

809
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:14.520
Tian WU: To estimate the probability of a light lighting, For each stop.

810
01:41:16.730 --> 01:41:19.349
Tian WU: Using this example, at stop 2,

811
01:41:20.530 --> 01:41:26.759
Tian WU: The probabilities of getting off will be 0.4, 0.42, 0.4.

812
01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:33.859
Tian WU: These are all the observations for a specific stop, Then we can take average.

813
01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:40.419
Tian WU: Say we can take average as 0.4 and regard this as the probability of getting off.

814
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.379
Tian WU: For this specific stop.

815
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:54.190
Tian WU: And later in the simulation, we will draw the number of passengers getting off, from… the pool of…

816
01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.030
Tian WU: The number of passengers on the bus.

817
01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:06.639
Tian WU: So these passengers depends on the number of people waiting at stop 2, And also the,

818
01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:11.720
Tian WU: The… the passengers who… Get on the bus at stop 1,

819
01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:16.099
Tian WU: So this is our pool of passengers.

820
01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:23.329
Tian WU: And for this group of passengers, The probability of alighting the bus.

821
01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:30.409
Tian WU: Will be the probability that is estimated from the, field observations.

822
01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:33.900
Tian WU: So for all the passengers on the bus.

823
01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:39.050
Tian WU: With the probability of a light.

824
01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:42.579
Tian WU: Being estimated by the field data.

825
01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:50.309
Tian WU: We can draw a random number of how many of the passengers will get off at a specific stop.

826
01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:56.869
Tian WU: So that's the three random components in our simulation.

827
01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:06.499
Tian WU: And to implement this simulation, we will make use of the Python library, which is called SynPy.

828
01:43:07.770 --> 01:43:11.600
Tian WU: So, SimPai is a discrete event simulation framework.

829
01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:20.699
Tian WU: And it is specifically designed to model the system where events happened at discrete points in time.

830
01:43:23.010 --> 01:43:25.119
Tian WU: Then what does an event mean?

831
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:30.250
Tian WU: So the event represents a specific action.

832
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:35.420
Tian WU: For example, when the bus Start to drive.

833
01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:42.309
Tian WU: Or when the bus arrives at a stop, Or when passengers start

834
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:48.539
Tian WU: Boarding, and bus departure, a stop after a certain dwell time.

835
01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.860
Tian WU: So these are, so-called events happened.

836
01:43:55.090 --> 01:44:02.810
Tian WU: And these events are processed in a chromological order according to their scheduled time.

837
01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.719
Tian WU: And only when they occur.

838
01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:12.669
Tian WU: So, say, during the time interval between the bus driving from stop A and stop B,

839
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:19.849
Tian WU: Even though the time passed, So recall that in the visualization, there is a clock, right?

840
01:44:20.490 --> 01:44:30.690
Tian WU: The time just keep pass, Keep passing, but the event will be paused because there's no event happens.

841
01:44:31.110 --> 01:44:36.690
Tian WU: There's no, there's no action that changed

842
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:41.200
Tian WU: The status of the overall, system.

843
01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:53.390
Tian WU: And only when the event happens, like bus arrives, passenger get on board, when this event happens, then we record the time of this event.

844
01:44:55.870 --> 01:45:04.770
Tian WU: And later in the demo, Jupyter Notebook, you can see a typical Sympi structure, including these four steps.

845
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:09.000
Tian WU: So, first of all, we will create a simple environment.

846
01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:14.400
Tian WU: So we use this, environment, we use… you will see this command.

847
01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:19.139
Tian WU: And second step is to define a generator function.

848
01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:24.949
Tian WU: So to generate the, the process that we… we are interested.

849
01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:27.420
Tian WU: So we have the bus trip.

850
01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:35.080
Tian WU: And the arguments can include many, many scenarios.

851
01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:40.080
Tian WU: So the first must be the environment, we just compute.

852
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:52.000
Tian WU: And then we can consider, if we run the simulation for many, many times, then we can record this number of simulations, so we can record

853
01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:53.719
Tian WU: This round number.

854
01:45:54.570 --> 01:46:03.719
Tian WU: And also, if there are different bus buses on the simulation, we can record the bus ID, and then track the behavior of different buses.

855
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:09.900
Tian WU: Then we can also, specify the road configuration.

856
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:18.099
Tian WU: Say, about the forward direction, it passed through, the bus passed through, those 11 stops.

857
01:46:18.370 --> 01:46:29.019
Tian WU: Whereas at the return direction, it will pass another 10 stops. So we can put the road configuration in this generator function.

858
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:35.480
Tian WU: And also, save the passenger data. Say how many people get on, how many people get off.

859
01:46:36.190 --> 01:46:41.999
Tian WU: So these are all the possible components or arguments in this generator function.

860
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:49.179
Tian WU: And also, as mentioned, for the discrete event simulation.

861
01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:57.609
Tian WU: For the time gap between two events, we need to pause the process, For those,

862
01:46:58.110 --> 01:47:00.389
Tian WU: Time interval between events.

863
01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:03.390
Tian WU: So we will yield this yield.

864
01:47:03.670 --> 01:47:08.529
Tian WU: Comment, environment time out for, say, the travel time.

865
01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.770
Tian WU: For the travel time, because nothing special happened,

866
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.810
Tian WU: We will not, like, use the… the resources.

867
01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:23.579
Tian WU: We, we just… Pause the process, but let the time pass.

868
01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:35.880
Tian WU: Then, we can add the generator function to the Sympi environment. So you will see int.process, you will see this key, function name.

869
01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:41.250
Tian WU: And we put… The defined generator function here.

870
01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:49.629
Tian WU: And then, the last step is to run the simulation and to let the time pass. So, environment.run.

871
01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:57.080
Tian WU: So this is how we execute the simulation, by processing all the scheduled events until completion.

872
01:47:58.540 --> 01:48:02.659
Tian WU: And you'll always see this environment.nel.

873
01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:06.830
Tian WU: It means we record the current time when an event happens.

874
01:48:08.370 --> 01:48:19.749
Tian WU: So to have a, intuitive understanding, maybe we go back to the demo drop your notebook.

875
01:48:32.290 --> 01:48:39.680
Tian WU: So, as mentioned, we have this week 4 demo Shook your notebook.

876
01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:44.369
Tian WU: It's called the, Week 4 Devo.

877
01:48:50.670 --> 01:48:59.069
Tian WU: So the first part is just show how to use this NumPy to generate, random variables.

878
01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:05.120
Tian WU: Like, we set a random seed, so every time the random numbers you generate it will be the same.

879
01:49:06.250 --> 01:49:12.040
Tian WU: And it's actually quite simple, just use… numpy.random.normal.

880
01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:14.259
Tian WU: And by defining the,

881
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:20.669
Tian WU: The mean and standard deviation, and how many random numbers you want, you can

882
01:49:21.010 --> 01:49:24.070
Tian WU: Generate the, corresponding result.

883
01:49:25.610 --> 01:49:30.379
Tian WU: And again, we can visualize the simulated random numbers.

884
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:32.880
Tian WU: So this is normally distributed.

885
01:49:33.250 --> 01:49:40.080
Tian WU: If we plot the, histogram, and also the, box and whisker plot.

886
01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:46.860
Tian WU: So hopefully by now, you, you are clear about the meaning of this fox and whisper plot.

887
01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:49.420
Tian WU: These two should be quite consistent.

888
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:57.089
Tian WU: And then we can go to this four-step structure to set up a simulation using Simply.

889
01:49:57.990 --> 01:50:08.580
Tian WU: As mentioned, the first step is to create a simple environment, and here we just do the simulation for a fixed traveling time from stop A to stop B.

890
01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:14.820
Tian WU: In this case, we defined the generator function.

891
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:19.230
Tian WU: And we first record the, departure time.

892
01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:23.420
Tian WU: And then the bus will travel for 3 minutes.

893
01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:28.529
Tian WU: And because for the 3 minutes, it's not an event.

894
01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:37.459
Tian WU: We just pause the process and use yield, To record the timeout, And then, after 3 minutes.

895
01:50:37.690 --> 01:50:39.230
Tian WU: The time passes.

896
01:50:39.590 --> 01:50:41.980
Tian WU: The bus arrives at stop speed.

897
01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:49.080
Tian WU: Then we, again, record the current time, which is the arrival time, Then we'll print it out.

898
01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:55.439
Tian WU: And then for step 3, we add the generator function to a simple environment.

899
01:50:55.670 --> 01:50:58.840
Tian WU: So this is environmental process.

900
01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:03.520
Tian WU: If we run it, Oops.

901
01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:07.859
Tian WU: I think I should have run the… previous cell.

902
01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:10.450
Tian WU: Yep.

903
01:51:11.890 --> 01:51:14.569
Tian WU: The bus process added to the environment.

904
01:51:19.250 --> 01:51:34.480
Tian WU: And then the step 4 is to run the simulation and let time pass. So if I run it, it says bus departs at time 0, bus arrives at time 3, simulation completed. Finally, the time is 3.

905
01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.670
Tian WU: So that is a very simple simulation of

906
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:44.340
Tian WU: just driving the bus from stop A to stop B.

907
01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.629
Tian WU: But later, we can add more elements, as discussed, into this framework.

908
01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.969
Tian WU: To, simulate more complicated scenarios.

909
01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:59.130
Tian WU: Let's have a 10-minute break first.

910
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:36.750
Tian WU: Okay, let's resume.

911
02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:41.650
Tian WU: So for this code,

912
02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:52.069
Tian WU: Don't worry that you don't have to start from scratch, you just ask the AI assistant of what kind of simulation you want to have.

913
02:02:52.130 --> 02:03:02.870
Tian WU: and add those random components one by one, and I think, the, GitHub compiler can handle this scale of simulation.

914
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:11.420
Tian WU: So I will use the next around 10 minutes, 10 to 15 minutes, to finish the demonstration and also the remaining slides.

915
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:26.880
Tian WU: So previously, we just set the very basic simulation for just a bus traveling from stop A to stop B. Now, we add a random travel time and run the simulation for 100 times.

916
02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:34.010
Tian WU: So instead of a fixed traveling time, 3 minutes, we add certain randomness.

917
02:03:35.770 --> 02:03:41.900
Tian WU: We have a list to store our results of the traveling time.

918
02:03:42.150 --> 02:03:46.280
Tian WU: Then here, we first define the generating… generator function.

919
02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:50.360
Tian WU: And later, we follow the remaining steps.

920
02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:58.359
Tian WU: So now, for the generator function, instead of the environment, we will record the run number.

921
02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:08.940
Tian WU: Because we have, we will have 100 simulations, so we need to have a placeholder for the number of simulations.

922
02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:23.080
Tian WU: At the beginning, it's the same. We record the departure time, and then we create random travel time from a normal distribution with mean equals to 3 and standard deviation equals to 0.3.

923
02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:29.309
Tian WU: So this is exactly what we did for the first part, which is the random number generation.

924
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:39.920
Tian WU: Here, we have this maximum function to ensure that the value we draw from the normal distribution must be positive.

925
02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:44.030
Tian WU: Because this is travel time, it must be non-negative.

926
02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:49.490
Tian WU: But if we really randomly drawn from a normal distribution like this.

927
02:04:49.820 --> 02:04:56.590
Tian WU: Although the probability of drawing a negative value is very, very, very, very small, but still, it is possible.

928
02:04:57.670 --> 02:05:06.610
Tian WU: And to avoid that situation, we use this max function to, to set the 0.1 as the lower bound.

929
02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:12.820
Tian WU: If the travel time is lower than the 0.1, we will use the 0.1 as our travel time.

930
02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:18.530
Tian WU: Then, during the travel time, the process will be paused.

931
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:25.100
Tian WU: And then we record the arrival time and print out that the bus arrived at a certain time.

932
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:36.379
Tian WU: Then we gradually append our results to the, to the… to the big list about the running number, the departure time, the arrival time, so on and so forth.

933
02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:47.480
Tian WU: So, start from here, we, use a loop, tool…

934
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:52.120
Tian WU: To implement the 100, simulations.

935
02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:59.970
Tian WU: So, again, step one, create the environment. Step two, we define the generator function, which is the upper part.

936
02:06:00.270 --> 02:06:05.020
Tian WU: And then step 3, we add the generator function to a SynPy environment.

937
02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:14.009
Tian WU: Now here, for this process, we have two arguments, the environment and also the number of simulations.

938
02:06:14.270 --> 02:06:20.939
Tian WU: Then we ask the, the SimPai to help us to execute the simulations.

939
02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:23.360
Tian WU: Then print the result.

940
02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:31.429
Tian WU: And the result will… will look like this. So for run 1, bus departures at…

941
02:06:31.730 --> 02:06:35.430
Tian WU: Time 0, and arrivals at times 3.2.

942
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:43.960
Tian WU: So every time, for every run of simulation, you can see that the arrival time will be different, will be slightly different.

943
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:52.040
Tian WU: So this time, it's drawn from a normal distribution with mean 3 and variance No, standard deviation, 0.3.

944
02:06:55.370 --> 02:07:01.550
Tian WU: Okay, so if you want to read more results, you can click this scrollable element.

945
02:07:02.270 --> 02:07:06.770
Tian WU: So it will show all the, 100 times of the simulation results.

946
02:07:12.170 --> 02:07:15.549
Tian WU: Now we come back to the slice.

947
02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:18.939
Tian WU: Let me share a screen again.

948
02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:28.340
Tian WU: Right.

949
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:33.399
Tian WU: So after we implement the assimilation, we can get the results.

950
02:07:33.580 --> 02:07:46.699
Tian WU: So recall that our KPI for this project is the ute, sorry, it's the seed utilization rate. So for each stop, we record the, we, we…

951
02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:57.959
Tian WU: Use this box and whisker plot to show the distribution of the… in 1,000 times the seed utilization rate for each stock.

952
02:07:59.010 --> 02:08:03.069
Tian WU: So this is the, the existing scenario.

953
02:08:03.190 --> 02:08:07.880
Tian WU: And the direction is forward, so from Qinmen to Shengshui.

954
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:14.270
Tian WU: And we can see that with the, driving of this bus setting out.

955
02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:22.300
Tian WU: The seed utilization rate increases, So again, this orange vertical bar represents the median.

956
02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:27.680
Tian WU: from… 12% to around 34%.

957
02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:34.749
Tian WU: And here, for this station, this is Shenzhui MTR exit.

958
02:08:35.290 --> 02:08:46.460
Tian WU: So you can observe there is a drop of the seat utilization rate, which makes sense, because people take bus all along… all along the way to get to the MTR station.

959
02:08:47.110 --> 02:08:51.179
Tian WU: And then, finally, all the passengers get off at the last station.

960
02:08:51.650 --> 02:09:00.770
Tian WU: So for this trip, the median of the seed utilization is around 12 to 34 across different stops.

961
02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:04.940
Tian WU: And because, on average, this

962
02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:13.100
Tian WU: Distribution shows a slightly right-skilled, because there are many, outliers on the right-hand side.

963
02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:20.220
Tian WU: So the mean value is expected to be a little bit higher compared to these orange bars.

964
02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:29.070
Tian WU: So if we take average, it will be around… Sirty… 30-something. So, 30-something.

965
02:09:29.310 --> 02:09:35.360
Tian WU: So that is the existing… Utilization rate across these different stocks.

966
02:09:37.670 --> 02:09:43.889
Tian WU: Similarly, we can calculate the median of seat utilization for the return direction.

967
02:09:44.370 --> 02:09:47.729
Tian WU: And these circled 3 stops are new.

968
02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:56.729
Tian WU: But we can still observe them, because the stops are there. We can use the field data, as mentioned, use the field data to

969
02:09:56.830 --> 02:10:05.970
Tian WU: To estimate the traveling time, to estimate the number of people waiting at different stops, and also the number of people getting off the bus.

970
02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:15.339
Tian WU: And we can also, based on certain assumption of the removed stops.

971
02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:21.720
Tian WU: So for these two stops, they are no longer there, and we have no way to

972
02:10:22.170 --> 02:10:28.310
Tian WU: Track the historical data of the number of passengers, getting on, getting off.

973
02:10:28.770 --> 02:10:41.569
Tian WU: So these are based on certain assumptions. We may use the number of passengers waiting at the neighboring stops as the number of passengers waiting at those stops.

974
02:10:42.330 --> 02:10:55.819
Tian WU: And regarding the traveling time, we can find the distance of this routine estate to the original bus stop, then have an estimate of the traveling time.

975
02:10:57.100 --> 02:11:05.410
Tian WU: So to generate the before adjustments, we need certain assumptions of the traveling time and passenger flow.

976
02:11:06.810 --> 02:11:10.619
Tian WU: And if the assumptions are correct, then…

977
02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:18.989
Tian WU: Based on the simulation results, the median of the seed utilization rate will be between 18% to 56%.

978
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:30.339
Tian WU: So comparing to the existing scenario, before the adjustment is done, then the seat utilization rate is indeed higher.

979
02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:37.060
Tian WU: Compared to… compared to the situation when the bus frequency is adjusted.

980
02:11:40.110 --> 02:11:50.170
Tian WU: Similarly, we can calculate or estimate the median of seat utilization for the return direction and before the adjustment.

981
02:11:55.270 --> 02:12:03.879
Tian WU: So, the results summary, Is that the adjustment appears to have reduced the overall seat utilization rate.

982
02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:10.770
Tian WU: But with the increase of the frequency of bus, the cost of the bus company must also increase.

983
02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:21.789
Tian WU: Right? So, within one hour, there will be one more bus to… to operate, and there must be the captain to drive the bus.

984
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.740
Tian WU: And also, the… the funeral, will… will be a cost.

985
02:12:27.020 --> 02:12:35.860
Tian WU: So, if we consider the cost, then it is a problem, or it is a question that whether the, the income

986
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:42.440
Tian WU: Produced by this bus frequency increase.

987
02:12:42.570 --> 02:12:44.720
Tian WU: Whether it can cover the cost.

988
02:12:45.110 --> 02:12:48.569
Tian WU: Of the, frequency increase of the bus.

989
02:12:52.650 --> 02:12:59.599
Tian WU: So then we can, formulate the inquiry to the transport department based on our analysis.

990
02:12:59.950 --> 02:13:07.959
Tian WU: So first, what type of operational and passenger flow data, like the stop level boarding and a light peak

991
02:13:08.130 --> 02:13:17.780
Tian WU: And off-peak passenger accounts were collected and analyzed when assessing the rerouting and schedule change for this bus number 56.

992
02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:22.550
Tian WU: So you notice that in our simulation.

993
02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.369
Tian WU: Some data are collected by ourselves.

994
02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:30.479
Tian WU: And some of them are estimated based on very limited data.

995
02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:37.040
Tian WU: They say we need to count the number of people waiting there, we need to count the number of people alight the bus.

996
02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:43.529
Tian WU: But whether this work, has systematically done by TD.

997
02:13:44.070 --> 02:13:47.230
Tian WU: As a review of the adjustment of the…

998
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:51.350
Tian WU: of 50… 56. So this is unclear.

999
02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.820
Tian WU: But we can ask whether this type of data is available, whether it is already collected and analyzed.

1000
02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:07.920
Tian WU: And second is, what quantitative models or criteria were used to evaluate whether the service modification would maintain

1001
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:11.210
Tian WU: Or improve the passenger service quality.

1002
02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:18.309
Tian WU: So what exactly criteria they use to evaluate whether this is a,

1003
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:23.350
Tian WU: group, this is a good adjustment. And in what sense?

1004
02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:27.540
Tian WU: Say, the city utilization rate decreased.

1005
02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:31.679
Tian WU: But on the other hand, from the perspective of the bus company.

1006
02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:34.069
Tian WU: So that may increase the cost.

1007
02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:44.790
Tian WU: Then, how… what kind of index they use to evaluate whether this modification is, is overall a good move or not.

1008
02:14:46.220 --> 02:14:57.599
Tian WU: And also, whether the relevant operational data sets, the consultation summaries, or evaluation models are available for public or academic review.

1009
02:14:58.390 --> 02:15:11.080
Tian WU: If these datasets are already there, then can we access to it so that it can save us the time to collect the data by ourselves, and also improve the data quality?

1010
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Tian WU: Because…

1011
02:15:13.590 --> 02:15:26.260
Tian WU: what we can do is just collecting very limited data based on our availability, but if the TD conducted that field study, maybe it is more

1012
02:15:26.630 --> 02:15:31.410
Tian WU: systematic, the number of data points will be more than ours.

1013
02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:41.750
Tian WU: So that will improve our model parameter estimation, so that it will increase the accuracy of our simulation.

1014
02:15:42.370 --> 02:15:46.820
Tian WU: We want to know whether such data is available to be accessed.

1015
02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:58.309
Tian WU: And if not, would the TD consider releasing or try to summarize the data based on the code on access to information?

1016
02:16:00.490 --> 02:16:04.059
Tian WU: So this is the second, case study.

1017
02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:21.999
Tian WU: So hopefully, through this case study, you have a taste of, how we can use simulations to quantitatively measure or predict the system behavior of the index we are interested in here, like the seat utilization rate.

1018
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:36.980
Tian WU: And in your own group project, if your focus is on the public transportation, you may also need to apply similar simulation technique into your study.

1019
02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:44.439
Simon Wang: Okay, so, so, Talia, maybe, allow me to jump in and, just to…

1020
02:16:44.510 --> 02:17:00.540
Simon Wang: offer kind of a high-level, summary, especially for students, with limited math background, and, you know, some of the technical details may be a little bit, overwhelming to you, but, I'm…

1021
02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:07.680
Simon Wang: I've only offered kind of, like, a layman's account on what we're trying to do here. So, basically.

1022
02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:12.459
Simon Wang: But when we do simulation, we are using, mass models,

1023
02:17:12.459 --> 02:17:24.149
Simon Wang: to try to approximate and try to get as close as we can an account of the reality, right? And because of the limited amount of data that we have.

1024
02:17:24.240 --> 02:17:37.289
Simon Wang: it's not possible to… to actually grasp, or to… to actually understand the reality, or have a very precise, descriptive account of the reality. So,

1025
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:56.080
Simon Wang: So instead of, trying to get that, we, we use the simulation approach. So that's kind of the general, kind of picture, what we're trying to do here. And as we are using, the math model, of course, we have to select different math models, right? There's the…

1026
02:17:56.370 --> 02:18:05.169
Simon Wang: The first one, we're talking about using the normal distribution, and then there's the binomial model, and then there's the poison.

1027
02:18:05.170 --> 02:18:05.570
Tian WU: listening.

1028
02:18:05.570 --> 02:18:25.050
Simon Wang: model for… for different, scenarios and different kind of, descriptions. So… so that's where we, we probably need some inputs from the experts. We have to consult the, the experts on… on this. But then at the same time, in order to have a, a good

1029
02:18:25.290 --> 02:18:36.959
Simon Wang: approximation or simulation, we also need some real data, right? So we can't just do simulation without any real data. That's why we have to go to the field.

1030
02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:52.800
Simon Wang: In fact, the master students who did this project, actually, they went to the site, and they collected some data, like when… how many passengers get off and get on the bus, and some real data we have to collect it.

1031
02:18:52.799 --> 02:19:06.520
Simon Wang: And with that real data fed into the model, we will have a model that can actually provide the kind of approximation or simulation for us to better understand the reality.

1032
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:16.470
Simon Wang: So… so that's why, you know, next week or the week after, you need to also think about whether you can collect some field data.

1033
02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:34.910
Simon Wang: But one thing we have to acknowledge is that we are very small teams, right? We are doing a course project, so it's not possible for us to do any kind of large-scale data collection. But the government, the government has got much more resources, you know? If they decide

1034
02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:48.770
Simon Wang: it is important to collect some data and then use the simulation to better understand the reality, to better make decisions. Then they can actually make the decision to collect more data. So that's where the data governance

1035
02:19:48.770 --> 02:20:07.199
Simon Wang: practices and data governance evaluation becomes very important and relevant here. So our job, you know, when we do our project, is to look at, you know, what data has been collected and curated by the government team, and whether or not this kind of data could be used for simulation.

1036
02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:22.329
Simon Wang: That can help us better understand the reality. So, most likely, the government team is not necessarily doing that. You know, the data they've got may be very limited, or they've got the data, but they've never done any simulation.

1037
02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:41.170
Simon Wang: to help them make decisions. Then that's our opportunity to make the argument, to say, look, you know, there's actually a better way to make decisions. So if you got the data, if you collect just a small amount of data with reasonable, you know, resources, then we will be able to

1038
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:59.340
Simon Wang: build a model, we're going to do the simulation that can help us to make better decisions. So I hope that you can keep this in mind. And of course, you know, there's the more technical details, and the AI can help you to write the code, to run the simulation, but more importantly, you need to know why. Why are we doing this?

1039
02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:04.459
Simon Wang: So, so I hope that that can sort of clarify things a bit, but of course,

1040
02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:15.649
Simon Wang: When… in the context of the specific project that we are working on, then we have to decide which model is the most appropriate and relevant for doing the simulation.

1041
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.720
Simon Wang: Right.

1042
02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:27.709
Tian WU: Yeah, I think for the remaining time, we'll work on the in-class exercise, too.

1043
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:34.570
Tian WU: But there are only 3 tasks, so hopefully it's more straightforward than last times.

1044
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:45.170
Tian WU: A tip is that when you use the GitHub Copilot, you can make use of the Ghost test.

1045
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:50.349
Tian WU: If you remember, for example, now you can see my…

1046
02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:52.989
Tian WU: You can see my notebook, right?

1047
02:21:54.220 --> 02:22:02.340
Tian WU: I put my cursor at the end of the comment, starts with this hash, And if I hit enter.

1048
02:22:02.690 --> 02:22:07.599
Tian WU: There will be such so-called ghost text showing up.

1049
02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:12.529
Tian WU: So if you think it's okay, then you hit the tab button.

1050
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:20.679
Tian WU: You don't have to, like, ask every question in the chat box.

1051
02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:26.120
Tian WU: So sometimes the, the ghost attacks is already good enough.

1052
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:36.609
Tian WU: You may consider to use this.

1053
02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:44.619
Tian WU: Rather than ask everything to GitHub Copilot using this chat box.

1054
02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:06.350
Tian WU: Yep, so after I hit the enter button, some… some… Command just shows up.

1055
02:23:06.470 --> 02:23:10.919
Tian WU: If you think it's correct, it is consistent with your requirement.

1056
02:23:11.330 --> 02:23:17.940
Tian WU: I said set the random seed at 48, but now it's set as 42, which is not right.

1057
02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:20.790
Tian WU: But I can, I can change it.

1058
02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:29.800
Tian WU: Yep.

1059
02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:38.080
Tian WU: And for 20 times, so we need to generate the, random variables for 20 times, and print… to print it out. So you can…

1060
02:23:38.370 --> 02:23:45.090

Tian WU: Or any questions regarding the course material, feel free to join the room and ask questions to us.

1074
02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:25.770
Simon Wang: Right, so, yeah, so there's four rooms, and if any of them, any of us are helping other students, you can either wait, or you can try another room. And what was the deadline of this in-class exercise?

Simon Wang: just in case, if they need a bit more time, I think we can be a bit more flexible here, but let's see how… because I think the exercise today is actually not very difficult, so maybe we'll see how it goes.
