## Slide 1: Week 1 Recap - Course Vision & Mission

### 🎯 **Our Unique Collaboration**

- **Cross-disciplinary partnership:** Math Department + Language Centre
- **Real-world focus:** Not just research papers, but actual government engagement
- **Citizen empowerment:** Using data science to strengthen democracy

### 🏛️ **The Hong Kong Government Challenge**

- **Key Question:** To what extent does HK government use data to make decisions?
- **Our Answer:** We don't know - because they don't tell us!
- **Our Solution:** Code on Access to Information (公開資料守則)

### 📊 **Our Approach**

- **Step 1:** Ask government departments directly about their data practices
- **Step 2:** Analyze their responses and current methods
- **Step 3:** Propose better data-driven solutions using math models
- **Step 4:** Send recommendations to lawmakers as gatekeepers

## Slide 2: Week 1 Recap - AI-Assisted Learning Revolution

### 🤖 **GitHub Copilot: Your Programming Assistant**

- **Traditional Learning:** Memorize syntax → Debug errors → Struggle with technical details
- **Modern Learning:** Write clear English prompts → Let AI generate code → Focus on understanding results

### 💡 **Key Insight for Zero-Programming Students**

- **Don't learn to program - Learn to prompt!**
- **Strategy:** Use chatbot to create framework → Move to VS Code → Use Copilot to refine
- **Goal:** Cross the threshold from program *user* to program *writer*

### 🛠️ **Essential Skills with AI**

- **Problem decomposition:** Break large tasks into smaller AI-manageable pieces
- **Prompt engineering:** Learn to communicate precisely with AI assistants
- **Focus shift:** From syntax/structure → Clear problem description in natural language

## Slide 3: Week 1 Recap - Mathematical Tools for Policy Analysis

### 📈 **Two Core Mathematical Models**

#### **1. Optimization Models**

- **Everyday examples:** Shortest travel path, minimize costs, maximize profits
- **Policy applications:** Bus scheduling, resource allocation, service efficiency
- **Our approach:** Simulation modeling (not theoretical equations)
- **Student project example:** Bus frequency optimization using virtual experiments

#### **2. Regression Analysis**

- **Purpose:** Understand relationships between variables
- **Policy examples:** Population density vs. service demand, factors affecting policy support
- **Tool:** Python's scikit-learn library
- **Accessibility:** No advanced math required - introductory statistics level

### 🎯 **Why This Matters**

- **Strong math students:** Apply skills to real-world problems
- **Limited math background:** Expand toolkit and gain awareness
- **Leadership preparation:** Work effectively with technical team members

## Slide 4: Programming 101 - The Bridge Concept

### 🌉 **Programming Language as a Bridge**

#### **Three Levels of Communication**

```
NATURAL LANGUAGE (Human) 
        ↓
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE (Bridge)
        ↓  
MACHINE CODE (Computer)
```

### 🗣️ **The Communication Challenge**

- **Humans think in:** Stories, concepts, intentions, ambiguity
- **Computers understand:** Binary code, precise instructions, logic gates
- **Programming languages:** Translate human intentions into machine-executable commands

### 💭 **Traditional vs. AI-Assisted Approach**

- **Traditional:** Learn programming language syntax and structure
- **AI-Assisted:** Describe what you want in natural language → AI handles the translation
- **Result:** Direct bridge from human intention to computer execution

## Slide 5: Python for Quantitative Data Analysis

### 🐍 **Why Python for Policy Analysis?**

#### **Data Analysis Superpowers**

- **Load large datasets:** Government databases, surveys, administrative records
- **Clean and process data:** Handle missing values, inconsistencies, formats
- **Statistical analysis:** Calculate trends, correlations, significance tests
- **Create professional visualizations:** Charts that convince policymakers

#### **Policy-Relevant Applications**

- **Public opinion analysis:** Survey data on policy support
- **Geographic analysis:** District-level service access and equity
- **Time series analysis:** Track policy impact over months/years
- **Comparative analysis:** Before/after policy implementation

### 📊 **Essential Python Tools for This Course**

- **Pandas:** Data manipulation (think Excel, but more powerful)
- **Matplotlib:** Basic charts and graphs
- **Seaborn:** Beautiful, publication-ready visualizations
- **NumPy:** Mathematical operations on data arrays
