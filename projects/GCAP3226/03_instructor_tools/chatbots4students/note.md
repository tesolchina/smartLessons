we are going to set up some chatbots for students and these chatbots will help them work on the projects

it would be similar to https://github.com/Bob8259/new-bytewise-frontend/blob/main/src/views/WritingBot.vue

we're going to set a similar page to this one

we'll have one tab that presents info about the chatbots including how to set up API key

and another tab is the chatbot itself

let's first analyze the codes

https://github.com/Bob8259/new-bytewise-frontend/tree/main/src/botConfig

maybe we're going to clone the entire

https://github.com/Bob8259/new-bytewise-frontend.git

we're going to set up a new vue 3226tutors

I need to have a plan first and then test locally

tomorrow we plan to guide students to write up a plan
they should share with the chatbot the info they have

so the system prompt would be to guide the students to assess data governance of the HK government -

we have a moodle post that is relevant here and we need to deploy the chatbot tutor first 

the tab page should be introduction https://tesolchina.github.io/ChineseMedAvatar/#selection 

but the iFrame we used is for tutor not avatar
