# GCAP 3226 Course Notes & Progress

 

 
We have a folder https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1XgV9YSG6vUI8YInABHr3IUV1v9B3pLon
you can access the folder using scripts here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating/GoogleDocsAPI

we also have a course planning docs https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LYdvuVJLaZ-MMm31jVc4hXo6tCrcWMk-Np4LiDUib8/edit?tab=t.0

there is an intro HTML here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3226/course_materials/intro.html which includes a tentative road map 

we have week 3 materials here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3226/course_materials/Week3

now we need to set up scripts from /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/modules/openRouterAI to read data from the google docs and send to LLM via openrouter and write the info back

## ‚úÖ WEEK 2 LECTURE MATERIALS COMPLETED!
- ~~Rename Week2_Materials_Guide.md to week2LectureNote.md~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Review Week 1 transcript and create recap slides~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Create lecture slides with programming 101 concepts~~ ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ **10 comprehensive slides created** for Week 2 lecture delivery
- üìÑ **Files Created:**
  - `/course_materials/Week2/week2LectureNote.md` (student guide)
  - `/course_materials/Week2/Week2_Lecture_Slides.md` (lecture presentation)



### **Week 2 Lecture Structure:**
- **Slides 1-3:** Week 1 recap (course vision, AI revolution, math tools)
- **Slides 4-6:** Programming 101 concepts and AI assistance benefits  
- **Slides 7-10:** Today's workshop structure and launch

### **Key Themes Highlighted:**
- **Programming as bridge** between natural language and machine code
- **Python for quantitative data analysis** of policy issues
- **AI assistance levels the playing field** for zero-programming students
- **Self-paced workshop** format for hands-on learning

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3226/course_materials/Week2/Week2_Materials_Guide.md
we need to rename this note as week2LectureNote.md
we should review the /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/GCAP3226/course_materials/week1_scripts/transcriptWeek1.md from week 1 and prepare three slides (bullet points) as recap 

then we go through the materials highlighting 
- programming 101- programming language as the bridge between natural language and machine codes 
- python can be used to analyze and visualize quantitative data 
- with AI assistance, even those with zero programming exp can learn to use these tools  
- the rest of today is a self-paced workshop 
please prepare the md so it can later be turned into slides

In the md life prepare some notes (bullet points and narratives) for students with zero programming exp but explain how LLM especially GitHub co-pilot may help

*Last Updated: September 6, 2025*

we need a simpler template 
just one google docs and one drive folder for each team 
the google docs should include some basic info like student names, emails
team member size up to 5 
then we select a topic to focus on data governnance 
/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating/GoogleDocsAPI we need to set up scritps to read and write notes to Google drive and sync them via local google drive as well (see how it can work to edit the docs via scripts)
