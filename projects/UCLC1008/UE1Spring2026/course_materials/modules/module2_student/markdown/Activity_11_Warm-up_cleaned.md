## Paraphrasing in Academic Writing

In academic writing, students often need to report ideas borrowed from existing sources. However, you must **never** directly copy ideas from other people’s work (even if it is only a short sentence or some phrases) and present them as your own. This is considered **plagiarism**, and offenders could face serious disciplinary consequences. In addition to using proper in-text citations, you must paraphrase borrowed ideas in a way that is distinctly yours.

### What is Paraphrasing?
Paraphrasing means expressing a borrowed idea (usually by someone else) using different words while preserving the original meaning.

In addition to avoiding plagiarism, paraphrasing borrowed ideas can:
- Foster a deeper understanding of the ideas.
- Help you develop a personal voice.
- Ensure that the ideas are meaningfully used in a particular context.

## Strategies for Effective Paraphrasing

You can use a combination of the following strategies for paraphrasing. Here are some examples:

### 1. Using Synonyms for Vocabulary and Expressions
- Large ⇔ major, big, sizable
- Recognition ⇔ detection, identification

### 2. Changing the Word Form
- Affect (verb) ⇔ effect, effectiveness (noun) ⇔ effectively (adverb)
- Motivate (verb) ⇔ motivation (noun) ⇔ motivational (adjective)

### 3. Changing the Voice (Active to Passive Voice)
- Active: *The researcher reviewed the existing literature.*
- Passive: *Current literature was reviewed by the researcher.*

### 4. Changing Sentence Patterns
- **Breaking a complex sentence into two simpler ones**:  
  - Original: *Although the experiment yielded interesting results, further research is needed to confirm the findings.*  
  - Paraphrased: *The experiment produced interesting results. However, more research studies are required to validate the results.*
  
- **Combining simple sentences into a more complex one**:  
  - Original: *The company has started using facial recognition. It wanted to reduce the administrative cost.*  
  - Paraphrased: *With an aim to lower administrative costs, the company has adopted the use of facial recognition.*
