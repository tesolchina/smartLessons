## Activity 3.1: Identifying Instances of Synthesis
Read the excerpts below and, in groups, highlight or indicate instances of synthesis. Classify each instance as follows:

- Agreement in literature
- Contrast in literature
- Transition showing agreement
- Transition showing disagreement (e.g., *while*, *whereas*)
- Integration of two or more sources

### Excerpt from Seng et al. (2021, pp. 2-3)
Facial Recognition (FR) is used in a wide range of scenarios at present, and its presence is becoming nearly ubiquitous, with more devices we interact with every day becoming smart. Examples of FR applications include:  
- Unlocking personal devices (Chmielewski, 2015; Finnegan & Kapo, 2018; Tengyuen, 2017) and physical spaces (Karantzoulidis, 2019; Wollerton, 2019)
- Facilitating in-person/on-site (France-Presse, 2019; Kwan, 2019; Peter et al., 2011) and online financial transactions (Kan, 2015; Knight, 2017; Petroff, 2016)
- Identification at customer service points of financial and non-financial organizations (Davis West, 2019; Mejia, 2019; Wang, 2018)
- Providing personalized services, special offers, or advertisements in retail stores, restaurants, libraries, and gas stations (Association, 2013; Bates, 2017; Pearson, 2018; Romero, 2019)
- Tracking people at retail stores or public gatherings (Bates, 2017; Brant, 2017; Davis West, 2018; Wolfe-Robinson, 2019)
- Assisting with boarding flights (Oliver, 2019; Wallace, 2018)
- Recording students’ class attendance (Toor, 2017)

As a result, there is growing discussion in the media about the use of FR in everyday life. Recent news indicates that people are in favor of using FR when retailers aim to prevent shoplifting (Davis West, 2018) or to help a celebrity identify stalkers (Castro, 2019). On the other hand, there are concerns about the use of FR, including its biased accuracy. For example, the evaluation of three commercial gender classification systems indicates that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group, with error rates of up to **34.7%**, while the maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is only **0.8%** (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018).

There are also other security and privacy risks involved with the use of FR (Prabhakar et al., 2003; Venkatraman & Delpachitra, 2008; Zhang et al., 2015). Recently, **27.8 million biometric records** were leaked by Biostar (Baraniuk, 2019), exposing users’ fingerprints and facial recognition data used to access protected buildings. While many FR systems store templates—condensed representations of facial data rather than full facial images—there are several ways to conduct an attack by exploiting a stolen template (Jain et al., 2005). Worse still, biometric templates are *unchangeable* and cannot be reissued in the same manner as passwords if compromised (Jain et al., 2008). Thus, the widespread reliance on FR as a primary authenticator could pose significant security risks (Mehmood & Selwal, 2020; Nandakumar & Jain, 2015).
