## Activity 1.3: Practising Paraphrasing Strategies

In this activity, you will practise various paraphrasing strategies by partly changing or rewriting the given phrases or sentences in **bold** based on the instructions provided.

### Paraphrasing Strategies and Examples

| **Strategies**                        | **Example Quotes**                                                                                         | **Your Answers** |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Using Synonyms for Vocabulary and Expressions** | 1. “**Contemporary biometric facial recognition is a digitalised extension of facial mapping, utilising an algorithm to undertake the comparison.**” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.22) <br><br> 2. “**These developments can be traced back to the introduction of biometric passports in the early 2000s.**” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.23) | (To be completed by student) |
| **Changing the Word Form**            | “**Biometric facial recognition systems could assist in multiple ways to enhance security in each of these senses.**” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.33) | (To be completed by student) |
| **Changing the Voice (Active to Passive Voice)** | “**Biometric facial recognition is rapidly becoming very widely used by government and the private sector.**” (Smith & Miller, 2021, p.35) | (To be completed by student) |
| **Breaking a Complex Sentence into Two Simpler Ones** | “**Facial recognition does not have the same degree of accuracy as fingerprint or DNA identification, and the frequency that facial features occur in the general population is unknown.**” (Smith et al., 2018, as cited in Smith & Miller, 2021, p.22) | (To be completed by student) |
| **Combining Simple Sentences into a More Complex One** | “**Changes in an individual’s face over time could result in false positive or negative matches. Relevant factors include: aging, cosmetic surgery, makeup, weight gain or loss, hair length, glasses, masks, and headwear such as scarves.**” (Samuels, 2017, as cited in Smith & Miller, 2021, p.22) | (To be completed by student) |

## Tools Available to Students

- **Collocation Dictionaries**: Tools like [https://ozdic.com](https://ozdic.com) can help you find words that are often used together with the word you have searched. For example, searching for the word “recognition” on Ozdic.com provides results with examples of how the word can be used with adjectives and verbs in sentences, along with commonly associated words.

## Giving Definitions

When providing definitions, while it is acceptable to directly quote an existing source with the author’s last name, year of publication, and page number, it is generally preferred that students **paraphrase** and rewrite the definition in their own words. See the example below:

- **Original Quote**: “’Biometric identification’ is broadly defined as the automatic identification of individuals by their physiological or behavioural characteristics.” (Iquii, 2018, as cited in Caines, 2021, p.29)
- **Paraphrased Definition**: Generally speaking, “biometric identification” refers to technologies that automatically recognise individuals’ identity based on their behavioural and physiological features. (Iquii, 2018, as cited in Caines, 2021, p.29)

By changing words like “broadly” to “generally” and “identification” to “recognise… identity,” the paraphrased sentence reflects a personal understanding while retaining the original meaning.
