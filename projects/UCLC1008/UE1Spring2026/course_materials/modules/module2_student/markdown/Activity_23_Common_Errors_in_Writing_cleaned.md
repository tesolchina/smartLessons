## Activity 2.3: Common Errors in Writing

Below are examples of problematic summarised sentences written by students. Your task is to identify the issue(s) with each summary and rewrite an improved version. Afterward, compare your answers with a classmate or peer and evaluate your responses.

### Example 1
- **Original Text**:  
  "Proponents of facial recognition (and surveillance technology in general) usually counter criticism of compulsory scanning with arguments along the lines of ‘if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear’. While questionable in any context, this argument overlooks the value for some students to have an opportunity to hide while in school. Indeed, the constant surveillance of campus facial recognition equates with a substantial curtailment in students’ right to obscurity while in school. In short, students will find it increasingly difficult to blend into the background, take a back seat, and generally go about their business ‘under the radar’." (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020, p. 122)

- **Student’s Writing (Summary)**:  
  Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020) argued that students will find it difficult to blend into the background.

- **Problem**:  
  The summary is overly brief and fails to capture the key ideas of the original text, such as the argument about students’ right to obscurity and the broader implications of constant surveillance.

### Example 2
- **Original Text**:  
  "Countries such as the US, UK and Australia are now seeing facial recognition technologies being installed and operated in a number of different types of (quasi)public space – including factories, cafes, airports, shopping areas, and government buildings. More often than not, the underlying aim of such systems is to identify and/or recognise people and track their movements. The specific applications of this technology are diverse. For example, retail providers are working on the development of pay-by-face technology. In other sectors, facial recognition technology is already being used by cafes to identify repeat customers and their regular orders (Bolger 2018). Workplaces are adopting facial recognition to allow employees to clock in and out, while airports are screening travellers by matching face scans to online images, watch lists, criminal databases and social media (Burt 2018). Perhaps most contentiously, cameras equipped with facial recognition technology are now being used by law enforcement agencies to identify criminals and search for missing persons (Grubb 2018)." (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020, p. 116)

- **Student’s Writing (Summary)**:  
  According to Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020), facial recognition technologies have been implemented in countries including the US, UK, and Australia, and in places such as factories, cafes, airports, shopping areas, and government buildings, namely for purposes such as pay-by-face technology, analysing customers' preferences, workplace management, airport security, and crime prevention.

- **Problem**:  
  While the summary captures the main applications and locations of facial recognition technology, it lacks specificity about certain uses (e.g., tracking movements or identifying repeat customers) and does not fully reflect the contentious nature of some applications mentioned in the original text.

### Example 3
- **Original Text**:  
  "In particular, we conducted a vignette-based study with 314 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to investigate their perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, based on thirty-five scenarios across eight different contexts of FR use. We found that users do not have a binary answer towards FR adoption. Rather, their perceptions are grounded in the specific contexts in which FR will be applied. The participants considered a broad range of factors, including control over facial data, the utility of FR, the trustworthiness of organisations using FR, and the location and surroundings of FR use to place the corresponding privacy risks in context." (Seng et al., 2021, p. 1)

- **Student’s Writing (Summary)**:  
  By collecting 314 participants' reactions to thirty-five scenarios in eight different contexts, the investigators analysed participants' perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world and found that their opinions were shaped by the contexts of use and a number of factors such as perceived control and trustworthiness.

- **Problem**:  
  The summary is generally accurate but could be more concise. It repeats details (e.g., the number of participants and scenarios) that are not essential for a summary, and it misses some nuances, such as the non-binary nature of participants' opinions on facial recognition adoption.

## Reflection Questions
As you discuss with your classmate or peer, reflect on the following questions:

- Have the key ideas been paraphrased and summarised without distorting the meaning?
- Is the length of the summarised version appropriate (neither too long nor too short)?
- Have you used the correct in-text citations?
