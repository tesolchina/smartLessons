## Activity 2.5: Self-Study
Read the article by McClellan (2020). Think critically about the points raised by the authors. Are the claims logically sound and well-supported by evidence? Integrate your evaluation and write a **150-word summary** of the article.

### Summary Guidelines
1. Summarising involves condensing the main ideas of the original text into a short, digestible version.
2. Copying without paraphrasing and citations is **plagiarism**. Use your own words when summarising ideas.
3. Pay attention to section headings and subheadings. Read the topic sentences and the last sentence of each paragraph to gain a quick understanding.

## Part 3: Synthesising Skills
### Purpose of this Section
To help students learn and practise synthesising skills for grouping or comparing and contrasting different sources in an argument.

### Pre-Learning Discussion
In groups, discuss the following questions and report your answers to the class later:
1. What does “synthesising” mean in the context of academic writing?
2. How do you think you can identify synthesised ideas in a piece of academic writing?

### What is Synthesising?
Synthesising entails meaningfully interweaving ideas from two or more sources to form a cohesive argument or narrative. When synthesising different ideas, it is essential to present a clear logical flow by ensuring that they complement or contrast with one another effectively. Synthesis words—such as *"similarly,"* *"on the other hand,"* or *"in contrast"*—are typically used to highlight relationships between different concepts. As always, proper in-text citations must be used at all times, as they provide the necessary attribution to the original authors, lending credibility to your synthesis and supporting your overall argument.

### Examples of Synthesising
#### Combining Similar Ideas from Two Sources
- Facial recognition systems are now being developed as a means of ensuring the integrity of various aspects of online courses. This includes controlling access to online educational content (Montgomery & Marais, 2014, as cited in Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020), as well as using webcam-based facial recognition to authenticate online learners (i.e., confirming that the people engaging in online learning activities are actually the persons they claim to be) (Valera et al., 2015, as cited in Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
- Companies such as Apple have begun using multifactor biometrics and facial recognition technology as a method to unlock phones (Apple, 2020, as cited in McClellan, 2020). Similarly, companies such as Google have developed technology that is able to recognise a user’s voice, such that its Google Home responses may be tailored to the specific user, or may not respond at all to users who it does not recognise (Larson, 2017, as cited in McClellan, 2020).

#### Integration of Different Sources (at Least Two) in an Information-Prominent Citation
- “The first reported use of FR dated back to the 1960s, when Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe developed the RAND tablet, which could be used to manually record the coordinate locations of various facial features, including the eyes, nose, hairline, and mouth” (Ballantyne et al., 1996; Gates, 2004, as cited in Seng et al., 2021, p. 2).
- “Similarly, there is a growing interest in using facial recognition technology for so-called e-assessment security – i.e., verifying the identity of students taking computer-based tests and examinations, and confirming their continued presence during the whole examination period” (Apampa et al., 2010; Hernández et al., 2008, as cited in Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020, p. 119).
