## Activity 1.5: Paraphrasing and Peer Feedback
In pairs, identify **5 sentences** from the article by Smith and Miller (2021) that you think are the most *valuable* or *interesting* and paraphrase them in your own words. Then, exchange the paraphrased sentences with your peers and provide constructive feedback using the checklist below.

### Checklist for Providing Constructive Feedback
#### Content
- The meaning of the original sentences is retained.

#### Organisation and Language
- Ideas are well-organised and coherent.
- Sentence structures and words have been changed.
- The language is grammatically accurate.

#### References
- Correct use of in-text citations and secondary citations is evident.

### Summary of Key Points
1. Always use **in-text citations** even if you have paraphrased sentences from the article.
2. Use a combination of various strategies (e.g., synonyms, changing the parts of speech, rewriting sentences) when paraphrasing.

## Part 2: Summarising Skills
### Purpose of this Section
To help students learn and practise how to extract key information from academic articles for academic writing.

### What is Summarising?
Summarising involves condensing a text to its **main ideas** and **key points** while omitting unnecessary details. It is essential for effective comprehension, note-taking, and academic writing, allowing students to distil information and present it concisely.

### Steps to Summarising
1. **Read Thoroughly:** Understand the original text's content, structure, and main ideas.
2. **Identify Key Points:** Highlight or note down the main ideas and arguments, distinguishing them from supporting details.
3. **Eliminate Extraneous Information:** Remove supporting details such as examples, anecdotes, and non-essential information that do not contribute to the core message.
4. **Use Your Own Words:** Rewrite the main points in your own language to ensure accurate understanding and avoid plagiarism. Aim for a summary that is significantly shorter than the original text (e.g., 1/3 of the original length).
5. **Maintain the Original Tone:** Preserve the author’s intent and tone in your summary.
