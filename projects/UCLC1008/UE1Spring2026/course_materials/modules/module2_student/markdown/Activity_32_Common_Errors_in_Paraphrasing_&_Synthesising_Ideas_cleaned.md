## Activity 3.2: Common Errors in Paraphrasing & Synthesising Ideas

Students often make mistakes when synthesising ideas in academic writing, such as failing to combine similar ideas, directly copying and pasting from the text, or not using proper in-text citations. Below are examples of problematic sentences written by students. Discuss with your peers to identify the issue(s) with each sentence and rewrite it.

### Example 1: Paraphrasing Biometric Identification
- **Original Text**: "Biometric identification is broadly defined as the automatic identification of individuals by their physiological or behavioural characteristics" (Caines, 2021, p. 29).
- **Student’s Writing**: Biometric identification is commonly known as the automatic identification of individuals by their physiological or behavioural features (Caines, 2021).
- **Problem**: To be discussed.

### Example 2: Paraphrasing Disadvantaged Groups and Surveillance
- **Original Text**: "It has been argued that those who are disadvantaged due to poverty, race, religion, ethnicity, and immigration status bear a disproportionately negative effect when being surveilled" (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020, p. 33).
- **Student’s Writing**: It is argued that disadvantaged groups (e.g., low socioeconomic status, ethnic minorities) might be slightly affected by the use of facial recognition (Andrejevic & Selwyn, 2020).
- **Problem**: To be discussed.

### Example 3: Synthesising Opinions on Facial Recognition (FR)
- **Original Text 1**: "Recent news indicates that people are in favour of using FR when retailers have to prevent shoplifting (Davis West, 2018) or to help a celebrity identify her stalkers (Castro, 2019)" (as cited in Seng et al., 2021, p. 2).
- **Original Text 2**: "Although facial recognition technology provides benefits in the criminal justice system, federal regulations must support these benefits while ensuring the privacy of citizens and guaranteeing safety from 'unreasonable searches and seizures' of the government" (McClellan, 2020, p. 377).
- **Student’s Writing**: Previous studies found that people are mostly in favour of using facial recognition for stopping crimes (Seng et al., 2021). On the other hand, McClellan (2020) stressed that regulations protecting citizens’ privacy must be in place.
- **Problem**: To be discussed.

### Example 4: Synthesising Applications and Perceptions of Facial Recognition
- **Original Text 1**: "Internationally, facial recognition technology has been used to prevent distracted driving" (McClellan, 2020, p. 371).
- **Original Text 2**: "However, poor experiences with airport security made several participants sceptical about gaining significant safety and security benefits from FR" (Seng et al., 2021, p. 14).
- **Student’s Writing**: According to McClellan (2020), facial recognition can help reduce distracted driving. Seng et al. (2021) argued that people’s bad personal experience could lead to scepticism towards the technology.
- **Problem**: To be discussed.
