## Activity 2.2: Summarising Arguments from an Article
Following the steps mentioned above, write a summary for each argument taken from the article by Seng et al. (2021).

### Argument 1: Privacy vs. Public Safety
- According to Seng et al. (2021, p. 14), individual privacy is often sacrificed for the greater good, such as ensuring **public safety**. This aligns with Himma’s *social contract theory*, which suggests that citizens must submit to the state for national security (Moore, 2010; 2015).
- Participants acknowledged the importance of physical safety, citing past incidents like bombings and physical harm in public spaces or on airplanes. These events influenced their support for facial recognition (FR) technology for tracking in public areas or identifying passengers during flight boarding to enhance safety and security.
- However, some participants expressed skepticism about the actual safety benefits of FR due to negative past experiences with airport security.

### Argument 2: Technological Advancements in Facial Recognition
- Seng et al. (2021, p. 2) highlight that facial recognition (FR) technology has significantly improved in recent years due to advancements in **hardware** and **algorithms** (Materese, 2018; Phillips et al., 2018).
- The failure rate of FR has dropped dramatically from *5% to 0.2%* between 2010 and 2018 (Materese, 2018).
- In several cases, FR has proven to be more effective than manual efforts in successfully recognizing human faces (Lu & Tang, 2015).

### Argument 3: Personal Autonomy and Control Over Data
- Participants in the study by Seng et al. (2021, p. 13) emphasized the importance of **personal autonomy** and **independence**.
- They felt comfortable with FR data being stored on their personal devices, as it provided a sense of *control* over sensitive information.
- They also expressed a desire to maintain boundaries for technology use in daily life, opposing identification or tracking by entities without their consent.
- Some participants were concerned that FR-based tracking could diminish the enjoyment of personal experiences, such as shopping or dining with family.

### Argument 4: Lack of Trust in FR-Based Authentication
- Seng et al. (2021, p. 13) note that participants reported a lack of **control** and **trust** in FR-based authentication systems.
- They feared that the technology could mistakenly authenticate unauthorized individuals, granting adversaries access to valuable information or belongings.
- This lack of trust in the efficacy of FR also contributed to participants perceiving limited benefits in using FR for personalized offers.
