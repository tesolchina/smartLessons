## Activity 3.4: Synthesising Arguments
Practise what you have learned so far by using synthesising skills to write a paragraph (150-200 words) opposing the use of facial recognition (FR) with supporting evidence from at least 2 articles. You may refer to the excerpts below regarding FR's privacy concerns. Use some points from other related articles to strengthen or contrast your arguments. Ensure proper in-text citations and include a reference list using the APA referencing style (7th ed.) at the end.

### Excerpts for Argument Against FR – Privacy Concerns

#### Excerpt from McClellan (2020, p. 374)
Even when accurate, facial recognition technology creates many privacy and safety concerns. For example, although Australia’s use of facial recognition technology to prevent “distracted driving” may assist in lowering accidents resulting from such distracted driving, it raises questions of whether or not the pictures taken invade the privacy of all drivers. Most notably, in America, this would become a question of whether or not the pictures taken violate the Fourth Amendment.

#### Excerpt from Seng et al. (2021, p. 14)
According to Moore (1998, 2000, 2003), individual privacy often needs to be sacrificed for the greater good, such as for public safety. This argument aligns with Himma’s argument on social contract theory, which states that as part of a society, citizens must submit to the state for national security (Moore, 2010; 2015). Participants understand the importance of physical safety, referring to past incidents of bombings and physical harm in public gatherings or on airplanes. These events influenced participants’ opinions to adopt FR for tracking in public spaces or identifying passengers during boarding a flight to enhance safety and security. However, poor experiences with airport security made several participants skeptical about gaining significant safety and security benefits from FR.

#### Excerpt from Andrejevic and Selwyn (2020, pp. 122-123)
Proponents of facial recognition (and surveillance technology in general) usually counter criticism of compulsory scanning with arguments like *‘if you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear’*. While questionable in any context, this argument overlooks the value for some students to have an opportunity to hide while in school. Indeed, the constant surveillance of campus facial recognition equates to a substantial curtailment in students’ right to obscurity while in school. In short, students will find it increasingly difficult to blend into the background, take a back seat, and generally go about their business ‘under the radar’. These might seem like undesirable behaviors from an educational perspective, yet for specific groups of students, these are legitimate coping strategies and invaluable means of ‘doing’ school on their own terms. Schools can be fraught places for children and young people to develop a sense of social identity and confidence, and much emphasis is now placed on making schools socially supportive and nurturing settings. In this sense, attempting to manage what is known and disclosed about oneself can be seen as a legitimate way for students to ensure that their actions and intentions are correctly interpreted and understood (Gordon et al., 2000). In contrast, facial recognition systems lead to what Hartzog and Selinger (2018, n.p.) term *“the normalised elimination of practical obscurity.”*

## Reflection – Peer Evaluation
After completing Task 3 (argument writing), find a peer and exchange your answers. Evaluate each other’s work based on the questions below as well as what you have learned. Assess whether the following aspects have been addressed in your peer’s and your own writing:

- Are the key ideas synthesised accurately with the meaning retained?
- Are similar and different ideas synthesised?
- Is there a meaningful logical connection between the ideas?
- Are the in-text citations and references correct?
- Have the ideas been paraphrased without distorting the meaning?
- Is the length of the synthesised version appropriate (neither too long nor too short)?
- Is the grammar accurate?
- Are the ideas coherent?
