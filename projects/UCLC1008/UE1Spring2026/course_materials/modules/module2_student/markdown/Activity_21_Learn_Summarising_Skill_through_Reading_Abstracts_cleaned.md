## Activity 2.1: Learn Summarising Skill through Reading Abstracts

A typical example showcasing the use of summarising skills in academic writing is the abstract of an academic journal article. Below is an abstract from a journal article about facial recognition technology. Read it and discuss the provided questions with your peers in class.

### Article 1: Seng et al. (2021)
> Facial recognition (FR) technology is being adopted in both private and public spheres for a wide range of reasons, from ensuring physical safety to providing personalised shopping experiences. It is not clear yet, though, how users perceive this emerging technology in terms of usefulness, risks, and comfort. We begin to address these questions in this paper. In particular, we conducted a vignette-based study with 314 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to investigate their perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, based on thirty-five scenarios across eight different contexts of FR use. We found that users do not have a binary answer towards FR adoption. Rather, their perceptions are grounded in the specific contexts in which FR will be applied. The participants considered a broad range of factors, including control over facial data, the utility of FR, the trustworthiness of organisations using FR, and the location and surroundings of FR use to place the corresponding privacy risks in context. They weighed the privacy risks with the usability, security, and economic gain of FR use as they reported their perceptions. Participants also noted the reasons and rationales behind their perceptions of facial recognition, which let us conduct an in-depth analysis of their perceived benefits, concerns, and comfort with using this technology in various scenarios. Through this first systematic look into users’ perceptions of facial recognition in the physical world, we shed light on the tension between FR adoption and users’ concerns. Taken together, our findings have broad implications that advance the Privacy and Security community’s understanding of FR through the lens of users, where we present guidelines for future research in these directions.

### Discussion Questions
1. What did the authors focus on when writing the article's abstract?
2. What writing techniques did the authors use in their abstract?

## Steps to Follow When Summarising an Article

To help you understand the process of summarising ideas, here are four steps you can follow when writing an article summary (adapted from McCombes, 2025):

1. **Read the text**: Quickly skim through the article/text to gain a basic understanding, and then read it thoroughly while taking notes on important points.
2. **Focus on the sections that interest you the most**: Pay attention to section headings and label important ones. Focus on sections that mention points/content valuable to your work.
3. **Identify key elements in the relevant sections**: After carefully reading the focused section, highlight only the most essential words and sentences. Exclude supplementary information and excessive details (e.g., detailed findings, statistical analyses, figures) from the summary.
4. **Write the summary**: Paraphrase the ideas and reorganise them into a short, coherent paragraph. Consider the following questions your readers might want to know when reading your summary of an empirical journal article:
   - What question or problem was addressed?
   - How was the data collected and analysed?
   - What were the most important/significant findings?
   - What are the implications of the results?

## Academic Integrity Note

**Important**: Directly copying and pasting sentences from an article is *not* an appropriate way of summarising ideas and could constitute plagiarism. Always ensure that you use your own words (*paraphrasing*) and cite the sources of the ideas used, following the APA 7th edition guidelines.

## Examples of Summarising

Below are examples of summarising. Pay attention to how the words are paraphrased and how the main ideas are extracted.

### Example 1
**Original Text (McClellan, 2020, p. 364)**:  
> The use of facial recognition technology has continued to grow and expand, providing helpful and creative uses in almost all aspects of life. The expansive use of the technology in social media, in particular, has begun to facilitate conversation amongst not only lawmakers, but everyday citizens as well. Although fairly new and exciting to some, facial recognition technology has become increasingly worrisome for many, in part due to the lack of regulations surrounding the technology. As facial recognition technology evolves and expands, there is an increasing need for regulation at the federal level. These regulations should consider and incorporate language that will allow the technology to continue providing benefits to society, but also ensure that limitations and penalties are placed on users of the technology to protect citizens.

**Summarised Text**:  
McClellan (2020) argues that despite the benefits of facial recognition technology in many areas of life, legal regulations need to be implemented to safeguard citizens’ rights and address public concerns.

### Example 2
**Original Text (McClellan, 2020, p. 371)**:  
> Although the regulations and policies of private companies appear to protect users’ privacy, most companies default to an “opt-in” method, and users must proactively seek to “opt out” of their data usage. Each policy also seemingly includes language that appears to ensure users’ data is “safe,” but then speaks in overbroad terms and fails to define important words and phrases, such as “metadata.” It is also concerning that privacy policies, such as that of Shutterfly’s, now protects the privacy of California consumers differently than it protects the privacy of other consumers. The lack of consistency and clarity for users further illustrates the importance and need for federal regulations surrounding facial recognition technology.

**Summarised Text**:  
According to McClellan (2020), while some private companies’ facial recognition policies claim to protect users’ privacy and personal data, the terms and definitions they utilise are vague, inconsistent, and sometimes missing, necessitating stricter government regulations.
