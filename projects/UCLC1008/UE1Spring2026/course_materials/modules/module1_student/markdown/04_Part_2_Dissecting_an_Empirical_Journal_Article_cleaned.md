## Part 2 - Dissecting an Empirical Journal Article

### Purpose of this Section
Many academic fields, especially in social sciences, psychology, and some areas of humanities, rely heavily on *empirical research*. This means the authors conducted their own studies, collected data, and analyzed it to answer a specific research question. Understanding how to read these types of papers is **essential** for evaluating evidence and incorporating it into your own arguments.

## Activity 2.1: Reading the Abstract of an Empirical Journal Article

The **Abstract** is a concise, standalone summary of the entire paper. By learning to read abstracts effectively, you can grasp the essence of a study and predict its content, helping you decide if the full paper is worth your time.

The Abstract is often the first part of an article you will read. It is designed to give you an overview of the study’s *purpose*, *methods*, *key findings*, and *implications*. Mastering abstract reading is a **huge time-saver** when you are sifting through multiple articles for your Position Paper. It also introduces you to the core components of empirical research.

### Instructions
