This section of the module is designed to help you consolidate your understanding, highlight the key distinctions between them, and reinforce the reading strategies you have learned.

### Activity 4.1: Key Differences between Empirical and Conceptual Articles

**Instructions:**  
Review your completed outlines for Article A (*empirical*) and Article B (*conceptual*). Then, complete the comparison table below to summarize the key differences between empirical and conceptual articles.

### Activity 4.2: Shared Features between Empirical and Conceptual Articles

While empirical and conceptual articles serve different purposes and have distinct structures, they are both forms of academic scholarship. This activity aims to identify the fundamental features that they share, reinforcing the core principles of academic communication.

**Instructions:**  
1. Think back to all the activities you’ve completed with Article A and Article B. What elements, sections, or characteristics did they both possess?  
2. List three shared features that are common to both empirical and conceptual articles:  
   -  
   -  
   -  
3. Explain the significance. For each feature you listed, briefly explain why it’s important for academic communication. What purpose does it serve in helping the reader understand the paper or in maintaining scholarly standards?
