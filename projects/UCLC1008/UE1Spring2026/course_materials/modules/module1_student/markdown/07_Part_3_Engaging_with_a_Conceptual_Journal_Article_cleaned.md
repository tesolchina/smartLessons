## Part 3: Engaging with a Conceptual Journal Article

### Purpose of this Section
Not all academic papers present new data from experiments or surveys. Many papers in English and the humanities are *conceptual* (or *theoretical*). These papers develop new theories, critique existing ideas, analyze concepts, or synthesize arguments without conducting new empirical research. Understanding how to read and engage with these papers is vital for developing your own nuanced arguments in your **Position Paper**.

### Activity 3.1: Reading the Abstract of a Conceptual Paper
**Objective:** To learn how to read an abstract to understand the core argument of a conceptual paper. This differs slightly from reading an empirical abstract because the focus shifts from data to *ideas* and *arguments*.

**Key Characteristics of Abstracts in Conceptual Papers:**  
Abstracts of conceptual papers will not have a **Methods** or **Results** section. Instead, they will focus on:  
- The problem the author is addressing.  
- Their argument or interpretation.  
- The way they will develop that argument.

#### Instructions
Read the Abstract of *Article B* carefully and try to identify the answers to the following guiding questions. You might want to highlight or underline the sentences that provide these answers.

**Guiding Questions:**  
1. **Context/Problem:** What existing idea, debate, or problem are the authors addressing?  
2. **Authors’ Position/Thesis:** What is the authors’ main argument or central claim?  
   *Hint: This is the core message the author wants you to take away. It is often a new interpretation, critique, or proposed framework. Look for phrases like “We argue that...”, “This article proposes...”, or “We contend that...”.*  
3. **Approach/Roadmap:** How will the authors build their argument? What is the logical flow of the paper?  
   *Hint: Look for phrases that signal logical progression like “This paper first reviews..., then analyzes..., and concludes by...”, or “Through a close reading of..., I demonstrate...”.*  
4. **Contribution/Conclusion:** Why is this argument important? What is its main contribution to the field?

## Academic Reading: Following Signposts

Unlike empirical papers with their predictable **IMRaD** structure, conceptual papers often have unique, argument-driven structures. This can feel disorienting at first. However, authors of well-written conceptual papers provide clues – *signposts* – to guide their readers. Learning to read these signposts helps you anticipate the argument’s direction and grasp the logical flow.

### Common Signposts
- **Logical Progression:** Does one heading naturally lead into the next? Does it seem like a cause-and-effect, problem-solution, or general-to-specific progression?  
- **Thesis Connection:** How does each heading relate to the overall thesis? Does it introduce a new aspect of the argument, provide evidence, or address a counterargument?  
- **Keywords/Concepts:** Look for repeated terms or concepts that might indicate a sequence.  
- **Transitional Language:** What are words or phrases that logically connect one section to the next? (e.g., “Having established X, we now turn to Y.”)  
- **Abstract Roadmap:** The flow of the argument should align with the “Approach/Roadmap” you identified in the Abstract.
