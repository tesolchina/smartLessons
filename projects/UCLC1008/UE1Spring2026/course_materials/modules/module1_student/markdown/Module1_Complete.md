## Part 1 - Mastering Academic Reading Skills

### Purpose of this Section
University-level English courses require you to engage deeply with complex ideas. In this section, you will learn how to effectively read academic papers – not just for comprehension, but for **critical analysis**, **argument identification**, and **information extraction**. These skills are fundamental for all your university studies, and they are especially crucial for successfully developing your upcoming *Position Paper*.

## Academic Reading: Skimming and Scanning Skills

In university, you will encounter a vast amount of reading material. However, you will not always have time to read every word of every paper. That is where **skimming** (reading quickly for general understanding) and **scanning** (searching for specific information) become invaluable skills. They allow you to quickly grasp the main ideas of a text or locate specific information you need, saving you time and helping you work more efficiently. These skills are particularly useful when you are conducting research for your *Position Paper*, as they help you quickly determine if an article is relevant to your argument.

## Activity 1.1: Skimming an Empirical Paper

Skimming is a valuable skill that involves reading quickly to gain a general understanding of an article’s main topic, purpose, and overall structure without focusing on every detail. Before committing to reading an entire academic paper, skimming helps you determine if it is relevant to your research or contains the information you are seeking.

### Instructions for Skimming

1. **Start Skimming Article A**
   Follow these steps to skim the article effectively:

   - **Step 1:** Read the *title* and *abstract*. What are the very first clues about the paper’s subject?
   - **Step 2:** Read all the main *section headings*. What are the major parts or stages of the research or argument?
   - **Step 3:** Read the *first* and *last sentence* of each paragraph in the **Introduction** and **Discussion** sections. The Introduction often explains the issue being explored and the paper’s aim, while the Discussion summarizes the findings and their implications. These sentences are typically topic and concluding sentences that encapsulate the paragraph’s main point.
   - **Step 4:** Look at any *Tables* or *Figures* and read their titles. Such visuals often summarize key data or concepts, while their titles indicate what they represent.

2. **Reflect and Summarize**  
   Without looking back at the article, write one clear sentence summarizing what you think Article A is about.

## Activity 1.2: Scanning an Empirical Paper

Practise the skill of *scanning*, which means quickly moving your eyes over a text to locate specific keywords, names, dates, or pieces of information, without reading for general comprehension.

### Instructions
Start scanning **Article A** to answer the following guiding questions:

1. **What is the sample size of the study conducted in Article A?** (i.e., how many participants were involved?)  
   *Hint: Look for numbers and words like “participants,” “sample,” “n=” or “N=” in the “Methodology” or “Results” sections.*

2. **Does the article mention the term “dangerous beliefs in the virtual world”? If so, in which section(s) does it appear?**  
   *Hint: Look for this specific phrase. You might find it in the Introduction (defining terms) or Discussion (linking findings to theory).*

3. **What is the official name of the primary survey, scale, test, or instrument used to collect data?**  
   *Hint: Look for proper nouns that are often capitalised or abbreviated.*

4. **Find a sentence that reports a statistically significant result.**  
   *Hint: It will often contain a phrase like “was significantly higher/lower,” followed by statistical data in parentheses (e.g., p < .05).*

5. **What is one specific limitation of the study that the authors mention?**  
   *Hint: Look for the keyword “limitation” or phrases like “we must be cautious.”*

6. **Find one concrete suggestion the authors propose for future research.**  
   *Hint: Look for keywords like “future research should,” “recommend,” or “a next step.”*

## Academic Reading: Locating the Core Arguments

Academic papers are built on arguments. To truly understand and critically engage with an article (and to write your own strong **Position Paper**), you need to be able to identify the author’s main argument (found in their thesis statement) and the individual points they use to support it (found in their topic sentences). These are the “signposts” that guide you through the author’s logic.

### Key Terms
- **Thesis Statement**: This statement expresses the central argument or main point of the entire paper. It is usually found in the *Introduction*, towards the end of the section. It should be a debatable claim that the rest of the paper will support. It is not just a statement of fact or a question.
- **Topic Sentence**: This is a sentence that contains the main idea or claim of a single body paragraph. It is usually the first sentence of a body paragraph (though sometimes it can be the second, or implied). It introduces the specific point that the rest of that paragraph will discuss and support with evidence. It should clearly connect back to and support the overall thesis statement.

## Activity 1.3: Identifying Thesis Statements and Topic Sentences

This activity focuses on practicing the identification of thesis statements and topic sentences within an academic text.

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Analyze the Introduction of Article B
- Read the Introduction of Article B carefully.
- As you read, **highlight or underline** the sentence(s) you believe to be the thesis statement.
- Briefly explain why you think this sentence is the thesis. Consider the following:
  - Does it make a claim?
  - Is it debatable?
  - Does it seem to set up the rest of the paper?

#### Step 2: Analyze Body Paragraphs from Article B
- Read the two provided body paragraphs from Article B carefully.
- For each paragraph, **highlight or underline** the sentence you believe to be the topic sentence.
- Briefly explain why you think the sentence is the topic sentence. Consider the following:
  - Does it introduce a clear point?
  - Is it supported by the rest of the paragraph?
  - Does it connect to the overall thesis?

#### Step 3: Reflect and Discuss
- Compare your chosen sentences with a classmate.
- Use the following discussion questions to guide your conversation:
  - How does the topic sentence of the body paragraph you analyzed support the overall thesis statement of the paper? Try to draw a connection between them.
  - Why is it helpful for a reader to be able to quickly find these key sentences?

## Part 2 - Dissecting an Empirical Journal Article

### Purpose of this Section
Many academic fields, especially in social sciences, psychology, and some areas of humanities, rely heavily on *empirical research*. This means the authors conducted their own studies, collected data, and analyzed it to answer a specific research question. Understanding how to read these types of papers is **essential** for evaluating evidence and incorporating it into your own arguments.

## Activity 2.1: Reading the Abstract of an Empirical Journal Article

The **Abstract** is a concise, standalone summary of the entire paper. By learning to read abstracts effectively, you can grasp the essence of a study and predict its content, helping you decide if the full paper is worth your time.

The Abstract is often the first part of an article you will read. It is designed to give you an overview of the study’s *purpose*, *methods*, *key findings*, and *implications*. Mastering abstract reading is a **huge time-saver** when you are sifting through multiple articles for your Position Paper. It also introduces you to the core components of empirical research.

### Instructions
Read the Abstract of **Article A** carefully and try to identify the answers to the following guiding questions. You might want to highlight or underline the sentences that provide these answers.

### Guiding Questions
1. **Background**: What is the general topic or problem this research addresses?
2. **Research Question/Purpose**: What specific question did the researchers try to answer, or what was the main goal of their study?  
   *Hint*: Look for phrases like “This study investigated...”, “The purpose of this research was to examine...”, or explicit questions.
3. **Methods**: Who or what did they study, and how did they do it?  
   *Hint*: Look for information about participants, the design (e.g., “experiment,” “interviews,” “survey”), and key procedures.
4. **Key Finding(s)**: What was the most important or significant result they discovered?  
   *Hint*: Look for phrases like “Results showed...”, “We found that...”, “The main finding was...”, “significant differences were observed...”.
5. **Conclusion/Implication**: Why does this research matter? What is the main takeaway message or the broader significance of their findings?  
   *Hint*: Look for phrases like “These findings suggest...”, “This research implies...”, “The study contributes to...”, “Our results have implications for...”.

## Introduction to the IMRaD Structure

Most empirical journal articles follow a standard structure represented by the acronym **IMRaD**. Understanding this structure will help you navigate these papers efficiently, know what to expect in each section, and find the specific information you need for your *Position Paper*.

**IMRaD** stands for:
- **Introduction**: Sets the stage, provides background, reviews relevant literature, and states the research question/hypothesis.
- **Methods**: Describes how the study was conducted (participants, materials, procedures). This section should be detailed enough for someone else to replicate the study.
- **Results**: Presents the findings of the study, usually with data, tables, and figures, but without interpretation.
- **Discussion**: Interprets the results, explains their significance, discusses limitations, and suggests future research. This is where the authors argue for the meaning of their findings.

## Activity 2.2: Guided Outline – Mapping the Empirical Argument

Read a full empirical paper (*Article A*) and create a structured outline by identifying the main points in each section. This activity will help you understand how researchers build their arguments, present their evidence, and discuss their findings, preparing you to critically evaluate and use such sources in your *Position Paper*.

### Instructions
Read *Article A* section by section. As you read, fill in the corresponding section of the outline template. Summarize information in your own words as much as possible. Avoid simply copying sentences directly from the paper. Use bullet points or short phrases.

### Outline Template for Article A

## Part 3: Engaging with a Conceptual Journal Article

### Purpose of this Section
Not all academic papers present new data from experiments or surveys. Many papers in English and the humanities are *conceptual* (or *theoretical*). These papers develop new theories, critique existing ideas, analyze concepts, or synthesize arguments without conducting new empirical research. Understanding how to read and engage with these papers is vital for developing your own nuanced arguments in your **Position Paper**.

### Activity 3.1: Reading the Abstract of a Conceptual Paper
**Objective:** To learn how to read an abstract to understand the core argument of a conceptual paper. This differs slightly from reading an empirical abstract because the focus shifts from data to *ideas* and *arguments*.

**Key Characteristics of Abstracts in Conceptual Papers:**  
Abstracts of conceptual papers will not have a **Methods** or **Results** section. Instead, they will focus on:  
- The problem the author is addressing.  
- Their argument or interpretation.  
- The way they will develop that argument.

#### Instructions
Read the Abstract of *Article B* carefully and try to identify the answers to the following guiding questions. You might want to highlight or underline the sentences that provide these answers.

**Guiding Questions:**  
1. **Context/Problem:** What existing idea, debate, or problem are the authors addressing?  
2. **Authors’ Position/Thesis:** What is the authors’ main argument or central claim?  
   *Hint: This is the core message the author wants you to take away. It is often a new interpretation, critique, or proposed framework. Look for phrases like “We argue that...”, “This article proposes...”, or “We contend that...”.*  
3. **Approach/Roadmap:** How will the authors build their argument? What is the logical flow of the paper?  
   *Hint: Look for phrases that signal logical progression like “This paper first reviews..., then analyzes..., and concludes by...”, or “Through a close reading of..., I demonstrate...”.*  
4. **Contribution/Conclusion:** Why is this argument important? What is its main contribution to the field?

## Academic Reading: Following Signposts

Unlike empirical papers with their predictable **IMRaD** structure, conceptual papers often have unique, argument-driven structures. This can feel disorienting at first. However, authors of well-written conceptual papers provide clues – *signposts* – to guide their readers. Learning to read these signposts helps you anticipate the argument’s direction and grasp the logical flow.

### Common Signposts
- **Logical Progression:** Does one heading naturally lead into the next? Does it seem like a cause-and-effect, problem-solution, or general-to-specific progression?  
- **Thesis Connection:** How does each heading relate to the overall thesis? Does it introduce a new aspect of the argument, provide evidence, or address a counterargument?  
- **Keywords/Concepts:** Look for repeated terms or concepts that might indicate a sequence.  
- **Transitional Language:** What are words or phrases that logically connect one section to the next? (e.g., “Having established X, we now turn to Y.”)  
- **Abstract Roadmap:** The flow of the argument should align with the “Approach/Roadmap” you identified in the Abstract.

## Activity 3.2: Following the Argument’s Signposts

The purpose of this activity is to recognize how headings, subheadings, and transition words act as *signposts* that create a clear *roadmap* of the writer’s argument in a conceptual paper. By understanding these signposts, you can better follow complex arguments and anticipate where the author is leading you.

### Instructions

1. Recall the **Approach/Roadmap** you identified in the Abstract of Article B. This is the authors’ stated plan for reaching their destination.

2. Arrange the scrambled headings below in the most logical order that you think the argument of Article B would flow, based on the abstract and the thesis statement of Article B.

   **Thesis Statement:**  
   *However, in this article, we seek to problematise the specific connotations and possible consequences of facial recognition technology in schools. Drawing on emerging debates amongst communications, media, and surveillance scholars, the article addresses a number of specific social challenges and concerns – not least various ways in which this technology might alter the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian, and oppressive lines.*

   **Scrambled Section Headings from Article B:**
   - Introduction
   - Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools
   - Discussion
   - Facial recognition technologies in education
   - Conclusion
   - The emergence of facial recognition technology across society
   - Making sense of the take-up of facial recognition technology in schools
   - Problematising the rise of facial recognition

3. Share your headings with a partner and briefly explain why you chose that order. What clues or **signposts** suggest a logical flow from one point to the next? Did you choose the same order? If not, discuss the reasons behind different choices.

## Activity 3.3: Argument Mapping – Deconstructing the Conceptual Argument

The goal of this activity is to read a full conceptual paper (*Article B*) and create an outline that precisely maps the author’s central argument and the key supporting points used to build their case. This exercise will help you understand how a complex argument is constructed and how different parts of a paper contribute to the author’s overall persuasive goal.

### Instructions

1. Read *Article B* section by section.
2. As you read each part, fill in the corresponding section of the conceptual argument map template.
3. Summarize information in your own words as much as possible.
4. Focus on extracting the essence of the argument and the type of reasoning or evidence used.

## Part 4 - Consolidation

### Purpose of this Section
You have now spent significant time analyzing two different general types of academic journal articles: *empirical* and *conceptual*. This section of the module is designed to help you consolidate your understanding, highlight the key distinctions between them, and reinforce the reading strategies you have learned.

### Activity 4.1: Key Differences between Empirical and Conceptual Articles

**Instructions:**  
Review your completed outlines for Article A (*empirical*) and Article B (*conceptual*). Then, complete the comparison table below to summarize the key differences between empirical and conceptual articles.

| **Features**              | **Empirical Article** | **Conceptual Article** |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Main Purpose**          |                       |                         |
| **Typical Structure**     |                       |                         |

### Activity 4.2: Shared Features between Empirical and Conceptual Articles

While empirical and conceptual articles serve different purposes and have distinct structures, they are both forms of academic scholarship. This activity aims to identify the fundamental features that they share, reinforcing the core principles of academic communication.

**Instructions:**  
1. Think back to all the activities you’ve completed with Article A and Article B. What elements, sections, or characteristics did they both possess?  
2. List three shared features that are common to both empirical and conceptual articles:  
   -  
   -  
   -  
3. Explain the significance. For each feature you listed, briefly explain why it’s important for academic communication. What purpose does it serve in helping the reader understand the paper or in maintaining scholarly standards?

## Part 5: In-text Citations & the References List

### Purpose of this Section
When working on assignments in this course, you may borrow ideas from various sources such as books, academic journals, newspapers, magazines, and websites. It is essential to acknowledge the sources (who and when) in the body of your work through **In-text Citations** and provide a complete list (who, when, what, where) of sources cited at the end of your work through an **End-of-text Reference List**. In this course, you are required to use the **APA style (7th edition)** for citations in your assignments to avoid plagiarism. Note that bibliographies, footnotes, or endnotes are not accepted as end-of-text citations in this context.

### What is Plagiarism?

**Plagiarism** refers to presenting someone else’s ideas as if they were your own. Common types of plagiarism include:

- Directly copying ideas without acknowledging the source.
- Directly copying exact words or sentences without quotation marks and without acknowledging the source.
- Submitting a previous assignment as if it was new to a course (even if you retake the same course).
- Translating texts from one language to another without acknowledging the source.
- Rephrasing someone’s ideas without acknowledging the source.
- Adding your own ideas to a source without acknowledging it.
- Copying output or text from Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools without acknowledging such use.

### Using Generative AI Tools in this Course

Since this course promotes the use of Gen-AI tools as a learning partner, you are encouraged to utilize them throughout your learning. Below are common scenarios of students using Gen-AI tools in this course and the actions required to avoid plagiarism.

#### Contexts of Using Gen-AI Tools and Actions to Avoid Plagiarism

| **Context**                              | **What Students Must Do to Avoid Plagiarism**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generating Essay Outlines or Ideas**    | - Develop original arguments as AI is merely for brainstorming. <br> - Verify ideas and acknowledge sources if not common knowledge. <br> - Write drafts independently. |
| **Summarising Academic Sources**         | - Rewrite summaries in your own words. <br> - Provide proper citations for the original work.                |
| **Drafting Thesis Statements or Topic Sentences** | - Refine AI suggestions with original thought. <br> - Align with the topic of assignments or research focus. |
| **Paraphrasing or Rewriting Text**        | - Ensure output from Gen-AI tools (e.g., translators, paraphrasing) is significantly reworded and restructured. <br> - Compare with the original source and cite properly. <br> - Use plagiarism checkers (e.g., Turnitin) before submission. |
| **Improving Vocabulary & Phrases**        | - Adapt AI suggestions to fit your own writing style. <br> - Avoid copying entire AI-generated phrases without modification. |
| **Improving Grammar and Style**           | - Ensure the core content is original. <br> - Do not submit AI-generated sentences verbatim unless quoted and cited. |
| **Generating In-text Citations and End-of-text Reference List** | - Verify all referenced sources to ensure authenticity. <br> - Adhere to the latest version (7th edition) of the APA referencing style. |

### Key Principles to Avoid Plagiarism with Gen-AI Tools

- **Originality:** The more effort you put into drafting ideas, the less likely plagiarism will occur.
- **Source Acknowledgement:** Verify and cite sources properly in your work.
- **Human Judgement:** AI is a tool, not an author. You must critically review and modify outputs.

## In-text Citations

### Rhetorical Functions of In-text Citations

The rhetorical functions of in-text citations are achieved through specific communicative purposes, often indicated by the strategic use of reporting verbs or signaling phrases. Below are examples from the article by Hong et al. (2020) (referred to as Article A):

| **Communicative Purpose**               | **Example from Article A**                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Establishing Credibility** <br> To demonstrate that your work is grounded in authoritative sources to boost your reliability as a writer. | "It has also been confirmed that perceived value has a mediating effect on the impact of innovative characteristics on behavioural intention (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020; Plouffe et al., 2001)." |
| **2. Guiding the Reader** <br> To provide signals to readers on where to obtain full references from the end-of-text reference list for further reading. | "The literature reports that perceived value positively impacts Continuance Intention to Use (CIU) (Chen & Chen, 2010). For example, Singh and Sinha (2020) found that perceived usefulness can predict people’s CIU for a certain merchant." |
| **3. Structuring Arguments** <br> To integrate borrowed material into your ideas while maintaining academic integrity. | "The results are consistent with previous studies (Albertsen et al., 2020; Lee, 2013), which proved that personal innovation had a positive relationship with perceived usefulness which accounts for the relationship between parents’ technological innovativeness and perceived value in this research." |
| **4. Engaging in Scholarly Conversation** <br> To position your work within existing academic debates, showing awareness of various perspectives or contrasting views. | "A previous study found that innovation has a significant association with perceived usefulness (Lee, 2013; Lewis & Sambamurthy, 2003). Liebana-Cabanillas et al. (2020) explored the relationship between e-book use intention and personal innovation, and found that personal innovativeness was positively associated with perceived usefulness, and also had a higher use intention (Lee, 2013). Other researchers have found that consumers were more likely to feel the value of smartphones if they had high innovativeness about technology (Hong et al., 2017), while technological innovativeness was found to influence the perceived value of mobile payment services (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)." |

### Basic Rules for In-text Citations

When integrating an idea from a source into your work, paraphrase the original wording and acknowledge the source (who and when). For example:

"One prominent educational application of facial recognition technology is campus security. This form of facial recognition is most prevalent in the US, where school shooting incidents have prompted school authorities to annually spend $2.7 billion on-campus security products and services (Doffman, 2018)."

**Basic Format:** Last Name of the Author(s) + Year of Publication

#### Common Categories and Examples

| **Category**                            | **Example**                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **One Author**                          | "... were defined by Altemeyer (1988) as ..." <br> (Lee, 2013)                           |
| **Two Authors**                         | "Singh and Sinha (2020) found that ..." <br> (Chen & Chen, 2010)                        |
| **Three or More Authors** <br> (Only the first author should be used followed by “et al.”) | "Moon et al. (2020) studied ..." <br> (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)                 |
| **Organisation as an Author**           | *First-time citation:* "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2020), up to 80% ..." <br> "... (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2020)" <br> *Subsequent citations:* "WHO (2020) reports that ..." <br> "... (WHO, 2020)" |
| **Two or More Works in the Same Citation** <br> (Order works alphabetically, separated by a semi-colon) | "(Lee, 2013; Lewis & Sambamurthy, 2003; Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)"              |
| **Unknown Date** <br> (Use “n.d.” for “no date”) | "Chan (n.d.) discusses ..." <br> (Chan, n.d.)                                          |

### Direct Quotations

When directly quoting or borrowing ideas by copying exact wording from a source, follow these guidelines:

- **Short Quotations (40 words or less):** Use double quotation marks ("...") for the exact wording and include a page number after the quotation. Examples:
  - "Kim et al. (2007) developed the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) to illustrate that 'consumers' perception of the value of M-Internet is a principal determinant of adoption intention, and the other beliefs are mediated through perceived value' (p. 111)."
  - "Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) aims to show that 'consumers' perception of the value of M-Internet is a principal determinant of adoption intention, and the other beliefs are mediated through perceived value' (Kim et al., 2007, p. 111)."

- **Long Quotations (More than 40 words):** Indent the exact wording and include a page number after it. Example:
  - Kim et al. (2007) have observed that:
    > Most adopters and users of traditional technologies are employees in an organisational setting, where they use the technology for work purposes, and the cost of mandatory adoption and usage is borne by the organisation. In contrast, adopters and users of new ICT are individuals who play the dual roles of technology user and service consumer. Most of them adopt and use the new ICT for personal purposes, and the cost of voluntary adoption and usage is borne by the individuals. (p. 112)

### Common Types of In-text Citations

There are three common types of in-text citations: **Author-Prominent**, **Signal Phrase**, and **Information-Prominent**. Their rhetorical functions are detailed below:

| **Type of In-text Citation**            | **Example**                                                                                      | **Rhetorical Function**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Author-Prominent Citation**        | "Wang and Teo (2020) argued that information quality and online service quality are positively associated with continuance intention and satisfaction, which have a positive association with perceived value." | - Highlights authority: Emphasizes the cited scholar’s credibility. <br> - Engages debate: Positions the author as an active participant in a scholarly conversation. <br> - Clarifies perspective: Signals the source’s stance. |
| **2. Signal Phrase**                    | "Other researchers have found that consumers were more likely to feel the value of smartphones if they had high innovativeness about technology (Hong et al., 2017), while technological innovativeness was found to influence the perceived value of mobile payment services (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)." | - Synthesizes evidence: Groups sources to show consensus or trends. <br> - Smooths transitions: Integrates citations naturally into the narrative. <br> - Redundancy avoidance: Prevents repetitive use of 'Author (Year)' structures. |
| **3. Information-Prominent**            | "Moreover, perceived value was found to significantly affect users’ intentions (Li et al., 2018; Wang, 2014)." | - Prioritizes evidence: Lets data/claims be the focus. <br> - Maintains flow: Emphasizes ideas rather than authors. <br> - Avoids author bias: Presents established facts over authors’ personal views. |

### Comparison of Different Types of In-text Citations

| **Type**                        | **Emphasis**            | **Rhetorical Function**           | **Reporting Verb**            |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Author-Prominent**            | Scholar’s voice         | Debate, critique                 | argue, criticize             |
| **Signal Phrase**               | Synthesis               | Situation/context, consensus     | indicate, show, suggest      |
| **Information-Prominent**       | Evidence                | Factual support                  | (Often omitted)              |

### Secondary Citations

A **secondary citation** (or *indirect citation*) refers to citing a source you have not read directly but found quoted or cited within a work you are reading. This is common when the original source is inaccessible or when referring to a well-known theory. You are strongly encouraged to read the original (primary) source to avoid misinterpretation by the author(s) citing the source.

**Example:** If you want to cite Wang and Teo’s (2020) argument (primary source) after reading Hong et al.’s article (secondary source), your citation might look like:
- "It has been found that higher levels of information quality and online service quality correlate with increased continuance intention and user satisfaction, both of which further enhance perceived value (Wang & Teo, 2020, as cited in Hong et al., 2022)."
- "Wang and Teo (2020) argued that higher levels of information quality and online service quality correlate with increased continuance intention and user satisfaction, both of which further enhance perceived value (as cited in Hong et al., 2022)."

**Note:** When using a secondary citation, paraphrase the idea taken from the secondary source. If citing exact wording, ensure proper quotation and citation.

### Introduction

The past few years have seen the implementation of automated facial recognition systems across a range of social realms. While these technologies are associated most frequently with promises to strengthen public safety, a growing number of other applications have also emerged – from verifying the identity of bank users, through to ‘smart billboards’ that display advertisements in response to the moods of passers-by. Of particular interest is how facial recognition technologies are beginning to be implemented in school settings. Indeed, there are now various educational applications of facial recognition and facial detection – including campus security systems, automated roll-calls and student emotion and attention monitoring. In countries such as the US, UK and Australia, these technologies have so far prompted little controversy or push-back. After all, schools in these countries have long utilised video camera surveillance systems and other forms of technology-based tracking and monitoring.

In this sense, facial recognition could be seen as a logical extension of technology-based surveillance trends established in schools from the 1990s onwards. However, in this article, we seek to problematise the specific connotations and possible consequences of facial recognition technology in schools. Drawing on emerging debates amongst communications, media and surveillance scholars, the article addresses a number of specific social challenges and concerns – not least various ways in which this technology might alter the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines. In light of recent calls from some commentators and activists for the outright banning of facial recognition in other areas of society, this paper considers whether (or not) these surveillance and monitoring technologies can ever be implemented in schools in ways that are not harmful and/or genuinely beneficial.

### Body Paragraphs from Article B

One prominent educational application of facial recognition technology is campus security. This form of facial recognition is most prevalent in the US, where school shooting incidents have prompted school authorities to annually spend $2.7 billion on-campus security products and services (Doffman 2018). Facial recognition systems have now been sold to thousands of US schools, with vendors ‘pitching the technology as an all-seeing shield against school shootings’ (Harwell 2018, n.p.). As well as purporting to identify unauthorised intruders, systems have been developed to make use of video object classification trained to detect gun-shaped objects, alongside more subtle forms of ‘anomaly detection’ such as students arriving at school in different-than-usual clothes, bags and other apparel (Harwell 2018). These systems promise to give school authorities an ability to initially determine who is permitted onto a school campus, and then support the tracking of identified individuals around the school site. As the marketing for the SAFR school system reasons, the capacity to know where students and staff are means that ‘schools can stay focused and better analyse potential threats’ (SAFR 2019).

Another application of facial recognition in schools is attendance monitoring – promising to put an end to the inevitable gaps and omissions that arise when human teachers are tasked with repeatedly conducting roll-calls of large student groups (Puthea, Hartanto, and Hidayat 2017). This application of facial recognition is proving popular in countries such as the UK and Australia where school shootings and unauthorised campus incursions are rare. For example, the Australian ‘Loop-Learn’ facial recognition roll-call system has been marketed amidst estimates of saving up to 2.5 hours of teacher time per week. Elsewhere, automated registration systems are also considered an effective means of overcoming problems of ‘fake attendance’ and ‘proxies’ – especially in countries such as India where fraudulent attendance is commonplace (Wagh et al. 2015).
