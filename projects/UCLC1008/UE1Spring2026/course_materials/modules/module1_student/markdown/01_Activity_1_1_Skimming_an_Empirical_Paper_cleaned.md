## Activity 1.1: Skimming an Empirical Paper

Skimming is a valuable skill that involves reading quickly to gain a general understanding of an article’s main topic, purpose, and overall structure without focusing on every detail. Before committing to reading an entire academic paper, skimming helps you determine if it is relevant to your research or contains the information you are seeking.

### Instructions for Skimming

1. **Start Skimming Article A**
   Follow these steps to skim the article effectively:

   - **Step 1:** Read the *title* and *abstract*. What are the very first clues about the paper’s subject?
   - **Step 2:** Read all the main *section headings*. What are the major parts or stages of the research or argument?
   - **Step 3:** Read the *first* and *last sentence* of each paragraph in the **Introduction** and **Discussion** sections. The Introduction often explains the issue being explored and the paper’s aim, while the Discussion summarizes the findings and their implications. These sentences are typically topic and concluding sentences that encapsulate the paragraph’s main point.
   - **Step 4:** Look at any *Tables* or *Figures* and read their titles. Such visuals often summarize key data or concepts, while their titles indicate what they represent.

2. **Reflect and Summarize**  
   Without looking back at the article, write one clear sentence summarizing what you think Article A is about.
