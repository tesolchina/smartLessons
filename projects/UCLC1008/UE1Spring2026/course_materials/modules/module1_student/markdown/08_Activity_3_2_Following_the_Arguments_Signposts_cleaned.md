## Activity 3.2: Following the Argument’s Signposts

The purpose of this activity is to recognize how headings, subheadings, and transition words act as *signposts* that create a clear *roadmap* of the writer’s argument in a conceptual paper. By understanding these signposts, you can better follow complex arguments and anticipate where the author is leading you.

### Instructions

1. Recall the **Approach/Roadmap** you identified in the Abstract of Article B. This is the authors’ stated plan for reaching their destination.

2. Arrange the scrambled headings below in the most logical order that you think the argument of Article B would flow, based on the abstract and the thesis statement of Article B.

   **Thesis Statement:**  
   *However, in this article, we seek to problematise the specific connotations and possible consequences of facial recognition technology in schools. Drawing on emerging debates amongst communications, media, and surveillance scholars, the article addresses a number of specific social challenges and concerns – not least various ways in which this technology might alter the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian, and oppressive lines.*

   **Scrambled Section Headings from Article B:**
   - Introduction
   - Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools
   - Discussion
   - Facial recognition technologies in education
   - Conclusion
   - The emergence of facial recognition technology across society
   - Making sense of the take-up of facial recognition technology in schools
   - Problematising the rise of facial recognition

3. Share your headings with a partner and briefly explain why you chose that order. What clues or **signposts** suggest a logical flow from one point to the next? Did you choose the same order? If not, discuss the reasons behind different choices.
