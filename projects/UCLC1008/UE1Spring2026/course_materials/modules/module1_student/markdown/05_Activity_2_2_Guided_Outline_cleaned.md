## Introduction to the IMRaD Structure

Most empirical journal articles follow a standard structure represented by the acronym **IMRaD**. Understanding this structure will help you navigate these papers efficiently, know what to expect in each section, and find the specific information you need for your *Position Paper*.

**IMRaD** stands for:
- **Introduction**: Sets the stage, provides background, reviews relevant literature, and states the research question/hypothesis.
- **Methods**: Describes how the study was conducted (participants, materials, procedures). This section should be detailed enough for someone else to replicate the study.
- **Results**: Presents the findings of the study, usually with data, tables, and figures, but without interpretation.
- **Discussion**: Interprets the results, explains their significance, discusses limitations, and suggests future research. This is where the authors argue for the meaning of their findings.

## Activity 2.2: Guided Outline – Mapping the Empirical Argument

Read a full empirical paper (*Article A*) and create a structured outline by identifying the main points in each section. This activity will help you understand how researchers build their arguments, present their evidence, and discuss their findings, preparing you to critically evaluate and use such sources in your *Position Paper*.

### Instructions
Read *Article A* section by section. As you read, fill in the corresponding section of the outline template. Summarize information in your own words as much as possible. Avoid simply copying sentences directly from the paper. Use bullet points or short phrases.

### Outline Template for Article A

- **Article Title**: [To be filled in]
- **Authors**: [To be filled in]
- **Overall Thesis Statement or Hypothesis** (Usually found near the end of the *Introduction* section): [To be filled in]

#### I. Introduction
  - **a. General problem/context**:  
    [Summarize the broader issue or context of the study]
  - **b. What previous research says (Main theme of literature review)**:  
    Summarize the key findings or theories from other studies that the authors mention. What is the current state of knowledge in this area?  
    [Summarize key points from literature review]
  - **c. The research gap**:  
    What is missing from the existing research? What question has not been answered yet that this study aims to address?  
    [Identify the research gap]
  - **d. This study’s specific research question(s) or aim**:  
    What exactly are these researchers trying to find out or do? This is often a very precise question or statement of purpose.  
    [State the specific research question or aim]

#### II. Methods
  - **a. Participants (Who/what was studied?)**:  
    Describe the people or things involved in the study. How many? What were their key characteristics? How were they selected?  
    [Describe participants]
  - **b. Instruments/Materials (What was used to collect data?)**:  
    What tools, questionnaires, tests, equipment, or materials did the researchers use to measure things or gather information?  
    [List instruments or materials used]
  - **c. Procedure (What were the exact steps?)**:  
    Describe the sequence of events. What did the participants do? What did the researchers do?  
    [Outline the procedure]

#### III. Results
  - **Key Finding(s)**:  
    Summarize the most important results in your own words. What did the researchers find? Focus on the main outcomes that directly answer the research question(s).  
    - [Finding 1]
    - [Finding 2]
    - [Finding 3]

#### IV. Discussion
  - **a. Interpretation of results (What do the findings mean?)**:  
    What conclusions do the authors draw from their data?  
    [Summarize the interpretation of results]
  - **b. Connection to thesis/hypothesis (Was the hypothesis supported?)**:  
    Do the findings support or contradict their initial hypothesis/research question(s)? How do the authors explain this?  
    [Explain connection to hypothesis]
  - **c. Limitations of the study**:  
    What weaknesses or shortcomings do the authors acknowledge in their own study? What might have affected the results or limited their generalizability?  
    [List limitations]
  - **d. Implications or suggestions for future research**:  
    Why does this research matter in the real world or for the academic field? What new questions arise from this study? What should researchers investigate next?  
    [Summarize implications and future research suggestions]
