## End-of-text Reference List

When writing an academic paper, it is essential to compile a reference list and place it at the end of your document. Follow these guidelines for formatting and organizing your reference list:

- Arrange all cited works in **alphabetical order** based on the last name of the first author.
- If a secondary source is used, include only the secondary source in the reference list, as you have not read the primary source directly.

### Example Reference Entries

Below are examples of properly formatted reference list entries with hanging indentation:

- Altemeyer, B. (1988). *Enemies of freedom: Understanding right-wing authoritarianism*. Jossey-Bass.
- Arpaci, I. (2016). Understanding and predicting students’ intention to use mobile cloud storage services. *Computers in Human Behaviour*, *58*(5), 150–157. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.067
- Aurigemma, S., & Mattson, T. (2017). Exploring the effect of uncertainty avoidance on taking voluntary protective security actions. *Computers & Security*, *73*(5), 219–234. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2017.11.001
- D’Mello, S. (2017). Emotional learning analytics. In C. Lang, G. Siemens, A. Wise, & D. Gašević (Eds.), *Handbook of learning analytics* (pp. 115–127). SoLAR.
- Plouffe, C. R., Hulland, J. S., & Vandenbosch, M. (2001). Research report: Richness versus parsimony in modelling technology adoption decisions—understanding merchant adoption of a smart card-based payment system. *Information Systems Research*, *12*(2), 208–222. https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.12.2.208.9697

**Note**: All lines of each entry except the first line should be indented about 0.5 inch (or 1.27 cm) from the left margin. This formatting style is known as a *hanging indentation*.
