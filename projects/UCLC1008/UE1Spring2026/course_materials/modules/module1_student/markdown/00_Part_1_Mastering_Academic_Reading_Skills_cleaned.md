## Part 1 - Mastering Academic Reading Skills

### Purpose of this Section
University-level English courses require you to engage deeply with complex ideas. In this section, you will learn how to effectively read academic papers – not just for comprehension, but for **critical analysis**, **argument identification**, and **information extraction**. These skills are fundamental for all your university studies, and they are especially crucial for successfully developing your upcoming *Position Paper*.

## Academic Reading: Skimming and Scanning Skills

In university, you will encounter a vast amount of reading material. However, you will not always have time to read every word of every paper. That is where **skimming** (reading quickly for general understanding) and **scanning** (searching for specific information) become invaluable skills. They allow you to quickly grasp the main ideas of a text or locate specific information you need, saving you time and helping you work more efficiently. These skills are particularly useful when you are conducting research for your *Position Paper*, as they help you quickly determine if an article is relevant to your argument.
