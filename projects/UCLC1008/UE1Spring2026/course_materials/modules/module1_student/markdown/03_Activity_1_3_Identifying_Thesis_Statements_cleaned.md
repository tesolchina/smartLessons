Introduction
The past few years have seen the implementation of automated facial recognition systems across a range of social realms. While these technologies are associated most frequently with promises to strengthen public safety, a growing number of other applications have also emerged – from verifying the identity of bank users, through to ‘smart billboards’ that display advertisements in response to the moods of passers-by. Of particular interest is how facial recognition technologies are beginning to be implemented in school settings. Indeed, there are now various educational applications of facial recognition and facial detection – including campus security systems, automated roll-calls and student emotion and attention monitoring. In countries such as the US, UK and Australia, these technologies have so far prompted little controversy or push-back. After all, schools in these countries have long utilised video camera surveillance systems and other forms of technology-based tracking and monitoring.

In this sense, facial recognition could be seen as a logical extension of technology-based surveillance trends established in schools from the 1990s onwards. However, in this article, we seek to problematise the specific connotations and possible consequences of facial recognition technology in schools. Drawing on emerging debates amongst communications, media and surveillance scholars, the article addresses a number of specific social challenges and concerns – not least various ways in which this technology might alter the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines. In light of recent calls from some commentators and activists for the outright banning of facial recognition in other areas of society, this paper considers whether (or not) these surveillance and monitoring technologies can ever be implemented in schools in ways that are not harmful and/or genuinely beneficial.

#### Step 1: Analyze the Introduction of Article B

- Read the Introduction of Article B carefully.
- As you read, **highlight or underline** the sentence(s) you believe to be the thesis statement.
- Briefly explain why you think this sentence is the thesis. Consider the following:
  - Does it make a claim?
  - Is it debatable?
  - Does it seem to set up the rest of the paper?

#### Step 2: Analyze Body Paragraphs from Article B

- Read the two provided body paragraphs from Article B carefully.
- For each paragraph, **highlight or underline** the sentence you believe to be the topic sentence.
- Briefly explain why you think the sentence is the topic sentence. Consider the following:
  - Does it introduce a clear point?
  - Is it supported by the rest of the paragraph?
  - Does it connect to the overall thesis?

#### Step 3: Reflect and Discuss

- Compare your chosen sentences with a classmate.
- Use the following discussion questions to guide your conversation:
  - How does the topic sentence of the body paragraph you analyzed support the overall thesis statement of the paper? Try to draw a connection between them.
  - Why is it helpful for a reader to be able to quickly find these key sentences?
