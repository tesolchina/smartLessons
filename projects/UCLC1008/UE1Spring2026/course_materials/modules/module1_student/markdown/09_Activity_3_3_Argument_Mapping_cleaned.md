## Activity 3.3: Argument Mapping – Deconstructing the Conceptual Argument

The goal of this activity is to read a full conceptual paper (*Article B*) and create an outline that precisely maps the author’s central argument and the key supporting points used to build their case. This exercise will help you understand how a complex argument is constructed and how different parts of a paper contribute to the author’s overall persuasive goal.

### Instructions

1. Read *Article B* section by section.
2. As you read each part, fill in the corresponding section of the conceptual argument map template.
3. Summarize information in your own words as much as possible.
4. Focus on extracting the essence of the argument and the type of reasoning or evidence used.
