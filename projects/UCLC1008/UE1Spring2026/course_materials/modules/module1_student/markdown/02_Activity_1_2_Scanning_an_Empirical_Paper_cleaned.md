## Activity 1.2: Scanning an Empirical Paper

Practise the skill of *scanning*, which means quickly moving your eyes over a text to locate specific keywords, names, dates, or pieces of information, without reading for general comprehension.

### Instructions
Start scanning **Article A** to answer the following guiding questions:

1. **What is the sample size of the study conducted in Article A?** (i.e., how many participants were involved?)  
   *Hint: Look for numbers and words like “participants,” “sample,” “n=” or “N=” in the “Methodology” or “Results” sections.*

2. **Does the article mention the term “dangerous beliefs in the virtual world”? If so, in which section(s) does it appear?**  
   *Hint: Look for this specific phrase. You might find it in the Introduction (defining terms) or Discussion (linking findings to theory).*

3. **What is the official name of the primary survey, scale, test, or instrument used to collect data?**  
   *Hint: Look for proper nouns that are often capitalised or abbreviated.*

4. **Find a sentence that reports a statistically significant result.**  
   *Hint: It will often contain a phrase like “was significantly higher/lower,” followed by statistical data in parentheses (e.g., p < .05).*

5. **What is one specific limitation of the study that the authors mention?**  
   *Hint: Look for the keyword “limitation” or phrases like “we must be cautious.”*

6. **Find one concrete suggestion the authors propose for future research.**  
   *Hint: Look for keywords like “future research should,” “recommend,” or “a next step.”*

## Academic Reading: Locating the Core Arguments

Academic papers are built on arguments. To truly understand and critically engage with an article (and to write your own strong **Position Paper**), you need to be able to identify the author’s main argument (found in their thesis statement) and the individual points they use to support it (found in their topic sentences). These are the “signposts” that guide you through the author’s logic.

### Key Terms
- **Thesis Statement**: This statement expresses the central argument or main point of the entire paper. It is usually found in the *Introduction*, towards the end of the section. It should be a debatable claim that the rest of the paper will support. It is not just a statement of fact or a question.
- **Topic Sentence**: This is a sentence that contains the main idea or claim of a single body paragraph. It is usually the first sentence of a body paragraph (though sometimes it can be the second, or implied). It introduces the specific point that the rest of that paragraph will discuss and support with evidence. It should clearly connect back to and support the overall thesis statement.
