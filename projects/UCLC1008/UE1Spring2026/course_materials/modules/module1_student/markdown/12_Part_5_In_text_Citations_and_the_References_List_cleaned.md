## Part 5: In-text Citations & the References List

### Purpose of this Section
When working on assignments in this course, you may borrow ideas from various sources such as books, academic journals, newspapers, magazines, and websites. It is essential to acknowledge the sources (who and when) in the body of your work through **In-text Citations** and provide a complete list (who, when, what, where) of sources cited at the end of your work through an **End-of-text Reference List**. In this course, you are required to use the **APA style (7th edition)** for citations in your assignments to avoid plagiarism. Note that bibliographies, footnotes, or endnotes are not accepted as end-of-text citations in this context.

### What is Plagiarism?

**Plagiarism** refers to presenting someone else’s ideas as if they were your own. Common types of plagiarism include:

- Directly copying ideas without acknowledging the source.
- Directly copying exact words or sentences without quotation marks and without acknowledging the source.
- Submitting a previous assignment as if it was new to a course (even if you retake the same course).
- Translating texts from one language to another without acknowledging the source.
- Rephrasing someone’s ideas without acknowledging the source.
- Adding your own ideas to a source without acknowledging it.
- Copying output or text from Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools without acknowledging such use.

### Using Generative AI Tools in this Course

Since this course promotes the use of Gen-AI tools as a learning partner, you are encouraged to utilize them throughout your learning. Below are common scenarios of students using Gen-AI tools in this course and the actions required to avoid plagiarism.

#### Contexts of Using Gen-AI Tools and Actions to Avoid Plagiarism

| **Context**                              | **What Students Must Do to Avoid Plagiarism**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generating Essay Outlines or Ideas**    | - Develop original arguments as AI is merely for brainstorming. <br> - Verify ideas and acknowledge sources if not common knowledge. <br> - Write drafts independently. |
| **Summarising Academic Sources**         | - Rewrite summaries in your own words. <br> - Provide proper citations for the original work.                |
| **Drafting Thesis Statements or Topic Sentences** | - Refine AI suggestions with original thought. <br> - Align with the topic of assignments or research focus. |
| **Paraphrasing or Rewriting Text**        | - Ensure output from Gen-AI tools (e.g., translators, paraphrasing) is significantly reworded and restructured. <br> - Compare with the original source and cite properly. <br> - Use plagiarism checkers (e.g., Turnitin) before submission. |
| **Improving Vocabulary & Phrases**        | - Adapt AI suggestions to fit your own writing style. <br> - Avoid copying entire AI-generated phrases without modification. |
| **Improving Grammar and Style**           | - Ensure the core content is original. <br> - Do not submit AI-generated sentences verbatim unless quoted and cited. |
| **Generating In-text Citations and End-of-text Reference List** | - Verify all referenced sources to ensure authenticity. <br> - Adhere to the latest version (7th edition) of the APA referencing style. |

### Key Principles to Avoid Plagiarism with Gen-AI Tools

- **Originality:** The more effort you put into drafting ideas, the less likely plagiarism will occur.
- **Source Acknowledgement:** Verify and cite sources properly in your work.
- **Human Judgement:** AI is a tool, not an author. You must critically review and modify outputs.

## In-text Citations

### Rhetorical Functions of In-text Citations

The rhetorical functions of in-text citations are achieved through specific communicative purposes, often indicated by the strategic use of reporting verbs or signaling phrases. Below are examples from the article by Hong et al. (2020) (referred to as Article A):

| **Communicative Purpose**               | **Example from Article A**                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Establishing Credibility** <br> To demonstrate that your work is grounded in authoritative sources to boost your reliability as a writer. | "It has also been confirmed that perceived value has a mediating effect on the impact of innovative characteristics on behavioural intention (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020; Plouffe et al., 2001)." |
| **2. Guiding the Reader** <br> To provide signals to readers on where to obtain full references from the end-of-text reference list for further reading. | "The literature reports that perceived value positively impacts Continuance Intention to Use (CIU) (Chen & Chen, 2010). For example, Singh and Sinha (2020) found that perceived usefulness can predict people’s CIU for a certain merchant." |
| **3. Structuring Arguments** <br> To integrate borrowed material into your ideas while maintaining academic integrity. | "The results are consistent with previous studies (Albertsen et al., 2020; Lee, 2013), which proved that personal innovation had a positive relationship with perceived usefulness which accounts for the relationship between parents’ technological innovativeness and perceived value in this research." |
| **4. Engaging in Scholarly Conversation** <br> To position your work within existing academic debates, showing awareness of various perspectives or contrasting views. | "A previous study found that innovation has a significant association with perceived usefulness (Lee, 2013; Lewis & Sambamurthy, 2003). Liebana-Cabanillas et al. (2020) explored the relationship between e-book use intention and personal innovation, and found that personal innovativeness was positively associated with perceived usefulness, and also had a higher use intention (Lee, 2013). Other researchers have found that consumers were more likely to feel the value of smartphones if they had high innovativeness about technology (Hong et al., 2017), while technological innovativeness was found to influence the perceived value of mobile payment services (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)." |

### Basic Rules for In-text Citations

When integrating an idea from a source into your work, paraphrase the original wording and acknowledge the source (who and when). For example:

"One prominent educational application of facial recognition technology is campus security. This form of facial recognition is most prevalent in the US, where school shooting incidents have prompted school authorities to annually spend $2.7 billion on-campus security products and services (Doffman, 2018)."

**Basic Format:** Last Name of the Author(s) + Year of Publication

#### Common Categories and Examples

| **Category**                            | **Example**                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **One Author**                          | "... were defined by Altemeyer (1988) as ..." <br> (Lee, 2013)                           |
| **Two Authors**                         | "Singh and Sinha (2020) found that ..." <br> (Chen & Chen, 2010)                        |
| **Three or More Authors** <br> (Only the first author should be used followed by “et al.”) | "Moon et al. (2020) studied ..." <br> (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)                 |
| **Organisation as an Author**           | *First-time citation:* "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2020), up to 80% ..." <br> "... (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2020)" <br> *Subsequent citations:* "WHO (2020) reports that ..." <br> "... (WHO, 2020)" |
| **Two or More Works in the Same Citation** <br> (Order works alphabetically, separated by a semi-colon) | "(Lee, 2013; Lewis & Sambamurthy, 2003; Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)"              |
| **Unknown Date** <br> (Use “n.d.” for “no date”) | "Chan (n.d.) discusses ..." <br> (Chan, n.d.)                                          |

### Direct Quotations

When directly quoting or borrowing ideas by copying exact wording from a source, follow these guidelines:

- **Short Quotations (40 words or less):** Use double quotation marks ("...") for the exact wording and include a page number after the quotation. Examples:
  - "Kim et al. (2007) developed the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) to illustrate that 'consumers' perception of the value of M-Internet is a principal determinant of adoption intention, and the other beliefs are mediated through perceived value' (p. 111)."
  - "Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) aims to show that 'consumers' perception of the value of M-Internet is a principal determinant of adoption intention, and the other beliefs are mediated through perceived value' (Kim et al., 2007, p. 111)."

- **Long Quotations (More than 40 words):** Indent the exact wording and include a page number after it. Example:
  - Kim et al. (2007) have observed that:
    > Most adopters and users of traditional technologies are employees in an organisational setting, where they use the technology for work purposes, and the cost of mandatory adoption and usage is borne by the organisation. In contrast, adopters and users of new ICT are individuals who play the dual roles of technology user and service consumer. Most of them adopt and use the new ICT for personal purposes, and the cost of voluntary adoption and usage is borne by the individuals. (p. 112)

### Common Types of In-text Citations

There are three common types of in-text citations: **Author-Prominent**, **Signal Phrase**, and **Information-Prominent**. Their rhetorical functions are detailed below:

| **Type of In-text Citation**            | **Example**                                                                                      | **Rhetorical Function**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Author-Prominent Citation**        | "Wang and Teo (2020) argued that information quality and online service quality are positively associated with continuance intention and satisfaction, which have a positive association with perceived value." | - Highlights authority: Emphasizes the cited scholar’s credibility. <br> - Engages debate: Positions the author as an active participant in a scholarly conversation. <br> - Clarifies perspective: Signals the source’s stance. |
| **2. Signal Phrase**                    | "Other researchers have found that consumers were more likely to feel the value of smartphones if they had high innovativeness about technology (Hong et al., 2017), while technological innovativeness was found to influence the perceived value of mobile payment services (Liebana-Cabanillas et al., 2020)." | - Synthesizes evidence: Groups sources to show consensus or trends. <br> - Smooths transitions: Integrates citations naturally into the narrative. <br> - Redundancy avoidance: Prevents repetitive use of 'Author (Year)' structures. |
| **3. Information-Prominent**            | "Moreover, perceived value was found to significantly affect users’ intentions (Li et al., 2018; Wang, 2014)." | - Prioritizes evidence: Lets data/claims be the focus. <br> - Maintains flow: Emphasizes ideas rather than authors. <br> - Avoids author bias: Presents established facts over authors’ personal views. |

### Comparison of Different Types of In-text Citations

| **Type**                        | **Emphasis**            | **Rhetorical Function**           | **Reporting Verb**            |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Author-Prominent**            | Scholar’s voice         | Debate, critique                 | argue, criticize             |
| **Signal Phrase**               | Synthesis               | Situation/context, consensus     | indicate, show, suggest      |
| **Information-Prominent**       | Evidence                | Factual support                  | (Often omitted)              |

### Secondary Citations

A **secondary citation** (or *indirect citation*) refers to citing a source you have not read directly but found quoted or cited within a work you are reading. This is common when the original source is inaccessible or when referring to a well-known theory. You are strongly encouraged to read the original (primary) source to avoid misinterpretation by the author(s) citing the source.

**Example:** If you want to cite Wang and Teo’s (2020) argument (primary source) after reading Hong et al.’s article (secondary source), your citation might look like:
- "It has been found that higher levels of information quality and online service quality correlate with increased continuance intention and user satisfaction, both of which further enhance perceived value (Wang & Teo, 2020, as cited in Hong et al., 2022)."
- "Wang and Teo (2020) argued that higher levels of information quality and online service quality correlate with increased continuance intention and user satisfaction, both of which further enhance perceived value (as cited in Hong et al., 2022)."

**Note:** When using a secondary citation, paraphrase the idea taken from the secondary source. If citing exact wording, ensure proper quotation and citation.
