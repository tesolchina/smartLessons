## d. This study's specific research question(s) or aim:

What exactly are these researchers trying to find out or do? This is often a very precise question or statement of purpose.

(1) Is there a relationship between parents' dangerous beliefs in the virtual world (DBVW) and their perceived value of face recognition use on campuses?

(2) Is there a relationship between parents' technological innovativeness and their perceived value of face recognition use on campuses?

(3) Is there a relationship between parents' perceived value of face recognition and their continuance intention to use the technology as a campus control approach?

## II. Methods

### a. Participants (Who/what was studied?):

Describe the people or things involved in the study. How many? What were their key characteristics? How were they selected?

The participants were parents of elementary students from Xuzhou, China. A total of 394 valid data were collected. The proportion of male and female respondents accounted for 41.6% and 58.4% respectively, with slightly more females. Most were between 21 and 30 years old and 31–40 years old, accounting for 79.2%.

### b. Instruments/Materials (What was used to collect data?):

What tools, questionnaires, tests, equipment, or materials did the researchers use to measure things or gather information?

The online questionnaire survey method was used. The questionnaire items were adapted from the relevant literature. The BDVW measurement was adapted from Aurigemma and Mattson (2017), the technological innovativeness measurement was adapted from Albertsen et al., (2020), and the perceived value measurement and the continuance intention to use measurement were both adapted from Wang et al., (2020).
