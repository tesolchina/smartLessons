# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

experimentation. This model marginalises social context and the cultural politics of knowledge.

• Williamson (2017) supports these points, highlighting the use of biometrics like facial recognition as "persuasive computing" that reframes teaching and learning as individual psychological behaviour change. This approach reduces learning to psychological traits observable via the face, which are then open to manipulation.

## Supporting Point 9:

**Topic Sentences (Main idea of this section):** the statistical processes through which facial recognition technologies quantify and frame a student's face are inherently reductive. This constitutes a very reductive engagement with students in contrast to how they would ordinarily be viewed by a human.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

* The "mechanistic gaze" of FR extracts and abstracts personal features into statistical images, many of which are never seen by human eyes but undergo algorithmic treatment.
* This is a "reductive engagement" because FR cannot discern the full range of human emotions or personal attributes.
* Students might even "game the system" by feigning expressions (e.g., dimpling mouth) to be classified as "learning."

## Supporting Point 10:

**Topic Sentences (Main idea of this section):** Another unsettling reduction of facial recognition technologies is their role in foregrounding fixed attributions of students' race and gender in informing school decision-making. Yet, even if these identifications are rendered more technically accurate, it can be argued that sorting students into socially constructed racialised and/or gendered categories remains a discriminatory practice – conflating biological characteristics with social attributes.
