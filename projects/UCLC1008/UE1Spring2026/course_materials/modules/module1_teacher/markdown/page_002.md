## Activity 1.2 (Answers)

Q1: 394

Q2: **Section 2.2 Dangerous Belief in the Virtual World**

Q3: Questionnaire items: BDWV measure, the technological innovativeness measurement, the perceived value measurement and the continuance intention to use measurement
Scale: 5-point Likert Scale
Data collection: Questionnaire Star

Q4: According to the significance test of model structural parameters (Hair et al., 2019), Fig. 3 shows that the influence path coefficient of DBVW on perceived value is β = -0.320 (p<0. 001), and that of technological innovativeness is β=0.447 (p<0. 001). This means that the higher the DBVW is, the lower the perceived value is; on the contrary, the higher the technological innovativeness, the higher the perceived value. Moreover, the influence path coefficient of perceived value on intention to use was β=0.406 (p<.001), indicating that the higher the persistent value, the higher the CIU (see Fig. 3).

Q5: This study did not examine the usage timing and the usage scope of FRT in elementary schools.

Q6: Future studies may focus on how face recognition systems can be applied in classroom management and to improve teaching performance.
