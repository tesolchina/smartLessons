## Activity 1.3 (Answers)

The identified thesis statement – "However, in this article, we seek to problematise the specific connotations and possible consequences of facial recognition technology in schools. Drawing on emerging debates amongst communications, media and surveillance scholars, the article addresses a number of specific social challenges and concerns – not least various ways in which this technology might alter the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines." – effectively serves as the article's core argument.

It makes a clear claim by stating the authors' intent to problematise facial recognition technology in schools and to highlight its potential negative social consequences. This assertion is highly debatable, as the technology is often presented as beneficial for security and efficiency, thus requiring the authors to build a case against these perceived advantages. Furthermore, it explicitly sets up the rest of the paper by signalling that the following sections will delve into the "specific challenges and concerns," drawing on scholarly debates to detail how the technology might lead to "divisive, authoritarian and oppressive" changes in schooling.
