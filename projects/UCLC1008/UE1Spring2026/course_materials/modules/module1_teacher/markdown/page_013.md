# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

## Supporting Point 1:

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Prevalence of campus security as a key application, especially in the US due to school shooting incidents.
- Significant annual spending ($2.7 billion) on campus security products and services in the US.
- Vendors actively market facial recognition systems to schools as a protective measure ("all-seeing shield against school shootings").
- Systems claim capabilities beyond intruder identification, including detecting gun-shaped objects and "anomaly detection" (e.g., unusual clothing/bags).
- The technology enables authorities to control campus access and track individuals within the school site.
- Marketing emphasises the benefit of knowing location to "analyse potential threats" (e.g., SAFR school system).

## Supporting Point 2:

**Topic Sentence (Main idea of this section):** Another application of facial recognition in schools is attendance monitoring.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- It promises to eliminate inefficiencies and gaps in traditional human-led roll-calls for large student groups.
- This application is popular in countries where school violence is less prevalent, such as the UK and Australia.
- Specific examples include the Australian "Loop-Learn" system, marketed for saving significant teacher time (e.g., 2.5 hours/week).
- Automated systems are seen as effective for combating "fake attendance" and "proxies," particularly in countries like India where attendance fraud is common.
