# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

## Supporting Point 5:

**Topic Sentences (Main idea of this section):** Schools are thereby positioned as relatively conducive contexts for the introduction of facial recognition technologies. This apparent 'good fit' between schools and facial recognition is supported by a couple of straightforward practicalities.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- The technology "fits neatly" with established school practices, processes, and existing infrastructure.
- Schools already have long-standing traditions of routinely collecting and maintaining photographic records of students' faces.
- This allows facial recognition systems to easily appropriate and utilise these existing name-and-face photographic databases.
- Schools have relatively stable populations, making practical implementation of the technology easier compared to more "open" institutional settings like hospitals or libraries.

## Supporting Point 6:

**Topic Sentence (Main idea of this section):** Another factor which may well be hastening the implementation of facial recognition systems in schools is their already extensive video monitoring and closed-circuit surveillance infrastructures.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Schools have enthusiastically adopted CCTV over the past 20 years (US, UK, Australia), leading to campus-wide surveillance coverage.
- Some schools have already tentatively adopted other surveillance technologies like teacher body-cameras, fingerprint enrollment, and RFID-tagging of students.
- In the US, school shootings have driven the rise of surveillance-based "solutions," including "smart cameras" for early warning systems.
