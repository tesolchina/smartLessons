# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

## Supporting Point 3:

**Topic Sentence (Main idea of this section):** Facial recognition is also being used in a number of 'virtual learning' contexts.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Development of systems to ensure the integrity of online courses.
- Used for controlling access to online educational content.
- Webcam-based facial recognition authenticates online learners, verifying their identity.
- Growing interest in using it for "e-assessment security" to confirm student identity and continuous presence during computer-based tests and exams.

## Supporting Point 4:

**Topic Sentence (Main idea of this section):** Finally, there is a growing interest in facial detection techniques as an indicator of student 'engagement' and learning.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Research claims that detecting "brief facial actions" can accurately indicate student engagement (or non-engagement) in online learning environments, showing states like boredom, confusion, delight, frustration, etc.
- Specific "insightful facial actions" for learning include brow-raising, eyelid tightening, and mouth dimpling.
- "Facial microexpression states" (lasting less than half a second) are believed to correlate with conceptual learning and offer insight into learners' thoughts.
- The face is viewed as a "continuous and non-intrusive way" to understand a learner's current mental state.
- Learning scientists focus on "academic emotions" (contentment, anxiety, frustration), engagement, social emotions, and "epistemic" emotions (from cognitive processing), believing detection can highlight learning problems.
- Some educationalists anticipate mass deployment of facial learning detection to identify "productive states" in student groups in real-time.
