# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

## Supporting Point 12:

**Topic Sentences (Main idea of this section):** Proponents of facial recognition (and surveillance technology in general) usually counter criticism of compulsory scanning with arguments along the lines of 'if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear'. While questionable in any context, this argument overlooks the value for some students to have an opportunity to hide while in school.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Constant facial recognition surveillance significantly curtails students' "right to obscurity" within the school environment.
- Students lose the ability to "blend into the background" or "go about their business 'under the radar'."
- For certain student groups, these behaviours are legitimate coping strategies and a crucial means of navigating school on their own terms.
- Facial recognition systems lead to the "normalised elimination of practical obscurity" (Hartzog & Selinger, 2018).

## Supporting Point 13:

**Topic Sentence (Main idea of this section):** [T]hese technologies are most likely to exacerbate (and certainly not mitigate) the authoritarian tendencies of the schools within which they are implemented.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Facial recognition surveillance is "intrinsically oppressive" (Hartzog & Selinger, 2018).
- FRT's primary intention in schools is control.
- FRT will likely worsen the authoritarian tendencies already present in schools.
- The "intoxicant of power" from such surveillance can lead to "overreach, mission creep, and systematic abuse" (Hartzog & Selinger, 2018).
- FRT will prompt students to alter their behaviour and normalise their conduct, "impeding crucial opportunities for human flourishing" (Hartzog & Selinger, 2018).
