# Conclusion

## Implications:
Why does this argument matter? What should we think or do differently now, based
on the authors' analysis? What are the broader consequences or applications of their
ideas?

* The authors' argument matters because it initiates a crucial conversation about
the implications of allowing this technology into schools, which they hope will
be tested and refined by educational commentators.
* The perceived benefits or "efficiencies" of FRT in schools are likely outweighed
by the negative consequences of automated sorting, classification, and profiling
of students.
* Schools risk becoming sites for the normalisation of a "societally dangerous"
technology, desensitising local communities to being automatically identified,
profiled, and potentially discriminated against ("facial privacy loss leader").
* The broader implication is a call for critical engagement and a potential outright
rejection of technologies that, despite their promises, pose fundamental threats
to student well-being and the nature of schooling.
