# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

## Supporting Point 14:

**Topic Sentence (Main idea of this section):** [A]utomated information collection leads to what might be described as a cascading process of automation: large databases require automated information processing, which, in turn, leads to automated decision-making processes.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Installing smart camera networks creates new databases usable for various functions, from automated risk detection/response to content customisation.
- This represents "function creep" and the displacement of human judgment by automation.
- Once implemented, facial recognition can take on diverse roles (attendance, lunch payments, expression recognition for security/pedagogy).
- The outcome is the removal of humans from the decision chain, which risks "social de-skilling" in recognising student needs and understanding behaviour.
- Despite potential advantages in speed, efficiency, and customisation, there is a danger of undermining crucial forms of socialisation integral to the learning process.

## Supporting Point 15:

**Topic Sentences (Main idea of this section):** Finally, facial recognition techniques embody an ambition to control and standardise the actions and behaviours of students' lives – arguably one of the central premises upon which contemporary digital society is founded. From this perspective, the students who stand to be harmed most by facial recognition technologies in schools are those who do not fit neatly into standardised systems, and those whose lives fall between the cracks of dataveillance.

**Key evidence or reasoning used (What kind of support do the authors provide for this point?):**

- Data derived from FR systems, combined with other school data, is unlikely to benefit outliers or those outside discrete categories.
