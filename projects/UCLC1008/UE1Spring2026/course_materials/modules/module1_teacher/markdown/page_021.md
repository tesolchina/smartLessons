# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

- FRT is likely to reproduce racialised class hierarchies in schools, given its tendency to foreground race and the existing social reproduction processes (Lewis & Diamond, 2015).
- Queer and trans students are another vulnerable group in heteronormative school contexts.
- Keyes (2019) argues that "data science is a profound threat for queer people" because data-driven technologies (like FR) oppose fluidity and autonomy by relying on norms and discrete categories.
- Gaps or blanks in non-binary/non-conforming students' data profiles will lead to diminished calculations, limited diagnoses, and a high chance of misrepresentation.

## Proposed Solution, New Model, or Contribution

What is/are the authors' primary suggestion(s), new framework, or main intellectual takeaway after building their argument? How do they answer the "Problem or Question" they posed at the beginning?

- The continued integration of facial recognition technology into schools is a serious and potentially alarming proposition that needs to be treated problematically, regardless of perceived benefits.
- The paper raises the basic question of whether facial recognition technology has any justifiable place in schools, suggesting a strong case for outright banning.
- They argue that merely improving the technical accuracy or scope of facial recognition (e.g., more diverse datasets) does not address the fundamental concerns of "othering, oppression and coercive control," and may even increase harm to marginalised groups.
- The authors suggest that a more logical response from students and staff would be to refuse to participate in systems fundamentally designed to divide, control, and harm school communities.
- They recognise that outright rejection is often not practical for students within inherently coercive school contexts. Therefore, the most realistic responses are likely to be "bottom-up, emergent, sporadic and playful tactics" of non-participation, resistance, and potential reinvention.
