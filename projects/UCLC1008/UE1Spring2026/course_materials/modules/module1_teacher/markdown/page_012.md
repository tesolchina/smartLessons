**Overall Thesis Statement (Usually found near the end of the Introduction section):**

However, in this article, we seek to problematise the specific connotations and possible consequences of facial recognition technology in schools. Drawing on emerging debates amongst communications, media and surveillance scholars, the article addresses a number of specific social challenges and concerns – not least various ways in which this technology might alter the nature of schools and schooling along divisive, authoritarian and oppressive lines.

### The Problem/Question

What existing idea, debate, or problem are the authors addressing?

The authors are addressing the problem that facial recognition technology is being increasingly introduced into schools (for purposes like security, attendance, and emotion detection) with little public controversy or critical scrutiny. They highlight that this technology is often viewed as a "routine addition" or a "logical extension" of existing school surveillance, implying a lack of awareness or concern about its deeper implications. The paper aims to challenge this uncritical acceptance and expose the specific social consequences and ethical concerns related to this technology's presence in educational environments.
