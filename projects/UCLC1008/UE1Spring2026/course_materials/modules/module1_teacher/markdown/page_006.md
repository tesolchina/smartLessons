**Overall Thesis/Hypothesis (Usually found near the end of the Introduction section):**

## I. Introduction

### a. General problem/context:

### b. What previous research says (Main theme of literature review):

The general public have concerns about whether this technology will infringe on human rights, resulting in racism and sexism (Dunn, 2020), due to the collection of individuals' most private biometrics, and the inability to determine the threats that it brings (Baragchizadeh et al., 2017; Quinn, 2015). Particularly, the public still has negative views on face recognition systems when they are applied to control access to campuses. Some parents have claimed that they violate the students' privacy; some worry about the leakage of students' personal information; and others are worried about insufficient funds and unclear usage standards (Qiu, 2017).

### c. The research gap:

In order to know how to obtain the trust and support of parents when implementing campus face recognition access control systems, it is necessary to explore the main influencing factors of parents' intention to use them.
