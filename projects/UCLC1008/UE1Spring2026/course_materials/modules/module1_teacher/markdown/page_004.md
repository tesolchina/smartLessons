# Module 2: Paraphrasing, Summarising & Synthesising Skills (Teacher's Copy)

## Topic Sentence 1: "One prominent educational application of facial recognition technology is campus security."

This sentence clearly introduces the specific point that the paragraph will discuss: the use of facial recognition for campus security. The rest of the paragraph directly supports this point by providing details and examples of how facial recognition is applied for security purposes in schools (e.g., prevalence in the US, identifying intruders, detecting gun-shaped objects, tracking individuals). This specific application of the technology connects directly to the overall thesis of problematising facial recognition in schools, as it highlights one of the connotations (safety/security) that the authors will later challenge or frame as problematic in their broader argument about its potential for "divisive, authoritarian and oppressive" outcomes.

## Topic Sentence 2: "Another application of facial recognition in schools is attendance monitoring"

This sentence succinctly introduces the paragraph's distinct focus: attendance monitoring as an application of facial recognition technology in schools. The subsequent sentences in the paragraph fully support this point by detailing its popularity in various countries (UK, Australia, India), providing specific examples of systems (Loop-Learn), and explaining the perceived benefits (saving teacher time, overcoming fraudulent attendance). This second application of the technology further elaborates on the authors' overall thesis by providing another concrete example of facial recognition's connotations (efficiency/convenience) in schools, which will be problematised later in the article.
