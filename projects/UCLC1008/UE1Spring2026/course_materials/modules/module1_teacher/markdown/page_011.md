technology, likely contrasting perceived benefits with underlying issues. This analytical
step is crucial before directly challenging its use.

Challenging the take-up of facial recognition in schools: This is the climactic point of
the argument, directly addressing the "consequences" and the "divisive, authoritarian
and oppressive lines" mentioned in the thesis. Having built the case, the authors now
present their direct challenge to the adoption of the technology, likely providing specific
arguments and evidence against its use.

Discussion: Following the main argument and its challenge, a Discussion section typically
interprets the arguments in a broader context, reflects on implications, and perhaps
acknowledges limitations or future research.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by summarising the main points, reiterating the core
argument, and offering final thoughts or calls to action, bringing the argument to a close.

The clues suggesting this logical flow are the progressive narrowing of focus (society to
education), the direct alignment with the thesis's keywords ("problematise,"
"consequences," "challenges"), and the natural progression from context to analysis to
direct challenge, culminating in a discussion and conclusion.
