- [ ] Collaboration on technical teams
- [ ] Understanding of system architecture or design

**For AI Version:**
- [ ] Mathematical and analytical capabilities
- [ ] Research methodology and approach
- [ ] Experience with data analysis or machine learning
- [ ] Theoretical understanding demonstrated
- [ ] Innovation and experimental thinking

### Step 2: Common Reference Letter Best Practices
