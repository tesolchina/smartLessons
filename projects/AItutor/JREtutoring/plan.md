Joint recruitment exam is a popular but challenging civil service exam in Hong Kong. Over 10,000 young people sit for it every year; only about 600 were selected to be interviewed for the first round of Administrative Officer. Only about 150 were shortlisted for the second round of interviews.

I took the exam in 2024 as a university English teacher and was invited to both the first and second interviews. I did not get the offer of AO nevertheless.

I am going to take the exam again this year- Nov 29. I am going to offer both free and paid contents and services for JRE candidates through Patreon.  I also have a WeChat group and a XHS group to connect with other

I need to apply for outside practice so I can set up a company and offer tutoring services online 

then I'll start offering posts and services on JRE writing and AO interviews 

Please suggest frameworks to organize the initative
