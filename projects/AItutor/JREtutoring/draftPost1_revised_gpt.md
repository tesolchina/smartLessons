# How to Tackle the JRE English Paper (2025 Edition)

This is a one-off paid post. It is not a membership. I may introduce membership later, but for now you can purchase this guide individually. Purchasers can ask me questions in the comments (I’ll answer with AI assistance) and discuss with other readers.

- Next JRE date: 29 November 2025
- Official info: Civil Service Bureau recruitment page (AO/EO and related grades): https://www.csb.gov.hk/english/admin/grade/ao/447.html
- My track record: I scored 123/200 in the English paper (Dec 2024), which is a very high score and led to my AO interview shortlist.
- I have also registered for the 2025 JRE, so I’m preparing alongside you.

What you will learn in this post:
- A practical, repeatable framework for the JRE English paper
- How to use policy objectives to structure answers
- How to balance pros and cons and respond to opposition
- How to use annexes effectively without drowning in details
- How to maintain civil-service tone while being creative and feasible
- A weekly prep plan and exam-day steps you can follow

## How the JRE English paper works (and what examiners want)

At a glance:
- You are given a policy scenario with background materials and annexes.
- You must analyse, decide, and recommend: not just write well.
- You’ll often be asked to:
  1) assess pros and cons,
  2) make a recommendation (support or oppose),
  3) propose measures (if you support: mitigate; if you oppose: alternatives).

Two reasoning modes you must master:
- If you support: acknowledge likely objections and propose concrete mitigation measures to make the policy work.
- If you oppose: propose credible alternatives that still achieve the stated objectives.

Write like a civil servant:
- Prioritise clarity, balance, and practicality over rhetorical flourish.
- Be creative yet feasible: fresh thinking, grounded in how government actually implements policy.
- Use evidence selectively from annexes to support your points (do not copy background verbatim).

---

## Start with policy objectives (anchor your answer)

Open with the policy objectives before you argue. This aligns your answer with how government frames decisions. In my 2024 paper, I anchored on:
- Increase labour supply
- Manage labour costs and reduce turnover
- Improve work–life balance and wellbeing
- Integrate the digital and real economies
- Raise productivity (often the top priority)
- Reduce carbon emissions
- Protect workers’ rights and safety (e.g., during typhoons)

Why this matters:
- Objectives give your essay direction and coherence.
- Every claim you make should link back to an objective.
- Objectives also reveal trade-offs (e.g., cost control vs worker protections). Acknowledge these for nuance.

Pro tip:
- Read the latest Policy Address and note the administration’s priorities. Emphasise those objectives to show policy awareness.

---

## Use annexes strategically (evidence without overwhelm)

You cannot read everything line-by-line under timed conditions. Use a meta-reading approach:
- Label each annex in one phrase as you skim:
  - Annex A: labour force pressures (need for change)
  - Annex B: rights and protections baseline (constraints)
  - Annex C: stakeholder reactions (feasibility, politics)
  - Annex D: comparisons/other context (options, best practice)
- Think of annexes as roles in a policy puzzle: need → constraints → stakeholders → options.
- Select 2–3 usable points total (or per key annex if time allows) and integrate them into your arguments.

Toolbox mapping (prepare in advance):
- Statistics → economic reasoning (supply, demand, costs, productivity)
- Rights/benefits → legal/social reasoning (protections, fairness, feasibility)
- Stakeholders → feasibility/political reasoning (who supports, who resists, why)
- Comparisons → innovation reasoning (adapt international lessons to local context)

---

## Build balanced pros and cons (cover multiple perspectives)

Pros (use varied perspectives):
- Soc
…iety and macro level
- Business and operational
- Innovation and new practices
- Values (environment, safety, fairness)

Examples you can adapt:
- Societal/macro: Flexible work can bring stay-at-home parents and healthy retirees back into the labour force, expanding participation and easing demographic pressure (objective: increase labour supply; evidence: Annex A trend data).
- Business/operational: Higher satisfaction reduces turnover and training costs; a broader labour pool can moderate wage pressure in tight markets (objective: manage labour costs and raise productivity; evidence: Annex C employer concerns you can acknowledge and then address).
- Innovation: Remote/hybrid arrangements push digital adoption and workflow redesign; human–machine collaboration is a plausible pathway (objective: integrate digital and real economies).
- Values: Less commuting cuts emissions; codified flexibility improves safety and continuity during disruptions (e.g., typhoons) (objectives: reduce carbon, protect workers’ rights and safety).

Cons (develop them with equal discipline):
- Practical/implementation: A “right to request” may be symbolic if employees fear stigma or retaliation; guidelines may be unevenly applied across teams.
- Economic/business: Compliance costs for SMEs (IT, cybersecurity, supervision) could be significant; uneven sectoral applicability may distort competition.
- Equity/fairness: White-collar roles benefit more than front-line or manual roles, risking perceptions of unfairness within and across firms.
- Policy design/effectiveness: If the design relies on requests rather than entitlements, utilisation may be low; objectives (e.g., productivity) may not materialise without complementary measures.

Recommendation logic you can reuse:
- If you support: state the case for adoption, show you have heard the key objections, then offer targeted mitigation measures that directly answer each objection.
- If you oppose: acknowledge why the proposal is attractive, explain where it falls short on effectiveness or fairness, then present alternatives that still deliver the core objectives (e.g., productivity, participation).

---

## Mitigation or alternatives that score (toolbox you can memorize)

If supporting (mitigation):
- Flexibility by industry and job type (avoid one-size-fits-all); define criteria and exemplars.
- Phased rollout and grace periods (start with departments that meet readiness thresholds).
- Government support: SME subsidies for secure IT, training vouchers, and advisory support for workflow redesign.
- Pilot first (e.g., specific government departments and selected sectors) before scaling.
- Consultation and feedback loops (employers, unions, professional bodies) to refine guidelines.
- Safeguards: anti‑retaliation provisions, confidential request channels, and review/appeal mechanisms.
- Monitoring and review: sunset/review clause (e.g., 24–36 months) with KPIs (uptake, productivity, staff retention, service levels).

If opposing (alternatives aiming at the same objectives):
- Targeted childcare and eldercare support to unlock labour supply.
- Productivity grants for process automation/digitisation without mandating WFH.
- Flexible hours or compressed workweeks for in-person roles.
- Sector-specific MOUs on hybrid rosters where feasible, rather than statutory rights.

Link each measure to a specific objection and to a policy objective. This is how you stay creative and feasible.

## Civil-service tone: micro-style checklist

Use this to keep your writing disciplined:
- Structure first: Introduction with objectives, then pros, cons, recommendation, measures.
- Neutral language: prefer “This approach would” over “I believe…”.
- Evidence cues: “Annex A indicates…”, “Stakeholders in Annex C suggest…”.
- Balanced modifiers: “While X could increase compliance costs, a phased rollout with SME support would mitigate…”.
- Numbered measures: list 2–3 concrete items with verbs (Introduce, Pilot, Provide, Review).
- Avoid emotive phrasing; critique mechanisms, not motives.
- Concise paragraphs; topic sentences that tie back to objectives.

---

## Time management that works under pressure

Target split (adapt to your pace):
- 15–20 minutes: Meta-read background + annexes; label each annex in one phrase; write your skeleton (Objectives → 3 pros → 3 cons → Recommendation → 2 measures).
- 50–55 minutes: Write pros and cons with selective annex evidence.
- 15–20 minutes: Write recommendation + mitigation/alternatives; add a crisp conclusion; quick proofread for tone and structure.

Key discipline:
- Don’t let reading exceed 20 minutes.
- Keep pros and cons balanced in length.
- Never skip the measures section (it’s often explicitly required).

## Weekly prep plan (10 weeks to go)

Weeks 10–8: Build foundations
- Read the latest Policy Address and note 8–10 recurring objectives.
- Practice meta-reading: take two
- Practice meta-reading: take two long government press releases or consultation papers each week and write one-phrase summaries for each “annex-like” section; extract 2–3 usable points per piece.
- Build your objectives bank: draft 8–10 policy objectives with 2 example arguments for each.
- Tone drill: rewrite one editorial paragraph per week into civil-service tone (neutral, structured, objective-linked).

Weeks 7–5: Structure and balance
- One full timed English essay per week (90 minutes). Use the skeleton: Objectives → 3 pros → 3 cons → Recommendation → 2 measures.
- Alternate stances: Week 7 support; Week 6 oppose; Week 5 support again.
- Build your mitigation toolbox: write 1–2 lines for each tool (flexibility, phasing, subsidies, pilots, consultation, safeguards, review), matched to a typical objection.

Weeks 4–3: Evidence and refinement
- Two full mocks (with annex bundles) per week. Force yourself to cite annex-style evidence in at least 3 paragraphs.
- Self-mark with a checklist: objectives-first, balance, annex use, civil-service tone, measures matched to objections, time split.
- Micro-drills: 10-minute openings (objectives + context) and 10-minute measure sets (2 targeted fixes) on random topics.

Week 2: Targeted polishing
- Write 3 short “cons + mitigation” pairs per day (4–5 sentences each).
- Re-read the latest Policy Address; highlight priorities to emphasise in your openings.
- Logistics: confirm exam venue/time; plan your sleep and commute; prepare your stationery and watch.

Week 1: Light but sharp
- Two final full mocks; one support, one oppose. Stop heavy practice 48 hours before exam.
- Build your phrase bank: 15–20 neutral connectors (However; In parallel; To mitigate; As set out in Annex A).
- Rest, review your skeleton and toolbox, and visualise your time plan.

---

## Exam-day steps (do-this list)

- Minutes 0–5: Skim the prompt; underline the explicit tasks (pros/cons + recommend + measures).
- Minutes 5–15: Meta-read annexes; label each in one phrase; choose 3–5 relevant objectives; draft your skeleton headings.
- Minutes 15–70: Write pros and cons. Aim for symmetry (3 and 3). Add selective annex cues (“Annex A indicates…”).
- Minutes 70–85: Recommendation + 2 measures (or 2 alternatives). Tie each measure to a named objection.
- Minutes 85–90: Proofread for tone, structure, and coverage. Ensure you actually did the measures/alternatives section.

Quick checks:
- Did you name policy objectives early?
- Are pros and cons balanced?
- Did you use annex evidence without copying?
- Are measures concrete and matched to objections?
- Is the tone civil-service neutral?
