Let's review the current codebase a bit
I'd like to focus more on the content first 

so I'd like to look at an outline of my presentation 

I'll use vibe coding to create more interactive materials 

but for overview 

I was reading some review articles on flipped classroom as well as my 2017 letter to the editor on lifting attendance requirement 

https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/2109347/relaxed-attendance-rules-hong-kongs-baptist-university-will-improve 

in terms of completing this project which is to prepare the talk /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/docs/poster.jpg

I need to first decide what to cover in the talk 

also I want to take the opportunity to invite more colleagues to join 

when we decide the content - we should ask 

- what are the key messages and arguments
- how can we demonstrate the potential of the tech
- what is the roadmap for developing a solid and practical solutions

===========update notes below ==============

But I actually need an outline in this note here for further editing
