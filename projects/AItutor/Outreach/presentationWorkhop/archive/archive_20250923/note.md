take a look at the html above

we need individual html files in a folder that can be brought together like the one above

please set up the folder and create a few html files with placeholders and revise the index.html /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/index.html

=============current issue and concern============

~~When I open the index file I got Error loading content. Please check the component file.~~

the index.html file is getting too large

let's take a modular approach and use some js and css to replace the single file

=============Current instructions ======

let's edit /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/components/overview.html and prepare some slides based on /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/presentations/overview.md 

in addition to the slides 

there should be an area designated for each slide where there will be more interactive component like html game etc- for now just a placeholder is ok 

for the first slide 

under it, let's embed this https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/2109347/relaxed-attendance-rules-hong-kongs-baptist-university-will-improve in an iFrame 

![1758251529313](image/note/1758251529313.png)

this part should be removed 

the interactive component should be under the slide not inside 




For overview there is sth wrong with the slides I wonder if we can embed a ppt or google slides here

then for each slide I show there would be some demo or other supporting materials

maybe you can generate a ppt file in a folder then I can edit

![1758249521483](image/note/1758249521483.png)

I want above to be replaced by an embedded PPT file
let's just work on the overview module - do not work on other tabs 

=========== update below on progress ==========

`/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/ObSync/Vault4sync/workshop on flipped classroom by Simon for GE colleagues.md  `

Please review the note above to learn a bit about the background of the workshop

we'll need to set up an html page that includes multiple components toggled
I'll provide the html files

you need to create a container html to bring them together ...
