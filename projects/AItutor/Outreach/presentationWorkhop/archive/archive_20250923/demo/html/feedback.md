feedback on this 

when click on the generate avatar video, after a while, an audio start playing but no control 

after audio play is done there is an audio play control but not working 

avatar-video-climate-change.webm can be downloaded 

but there is no sound 

bullet points are showing 

a robot is animating 

but no sound 

I think we made some breakthrough
but we need this to be fully function
