Let's first revisit an SCMP letter I published in 2017 - 8 years ago 

https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/2109347/relaxed-attendance-rules-hong-kongs-baptist-university-will-improve

## Key Insights from 2017 That Led to Today's AI Workshop

Based on the foundational ideas in this letter, here are three critical developments that brought us to today's AI-powered flipped classroom revolution:

â€¢ **From Video Creation Barriers to AI-Assisted Production**: In 2017, I mentioned creating "a series of video lectures" - a process that took hours of manual work. Today's AI tools like HeyGen transform this from a 4-6 hour production process into a 5-10 minute automated workflow, removing the technical barriers that prevented widespread adoption.

â€¢ **From WhatsApp Groups to 24/7 AI Teaching Assistants**: The letter described using WhatsApp to "stay connected beyond classrooms" and hold "virtual class meetings." Now, AI streaming avatars provide constant, intelligent student support, answering questions and facilitating learning at any hour, scaling personalized attention infinitely.

â€¢ **From Encouraging Faculty Innovation to Democratizing Educational Technology**: The 2017 vision called for "more resources to encourage faculty members to flip classrooms." Today's AI tools democratize this innovation - no longer requiring technical expertise or significant time investment, making flipped classroom accessible to every educator regardless of their technology background.

## 2025 Update: GE Office Policy Support & New Opportunities

The timing of today's workshop is particularly relevant as the **GE Office has recently introduced new policies to actively promote flipped classroom adoption**:

### Current GE Office Initiatives:
- **Funding Support**: Financial resources now available to support flipped classroom implementation
- **50/50 Teaching Model**: Year 1 GE teachers are encouraged to allocate up to **50% of classroom time** to studying flipped classroom materials, with the remaining **50% for in-class teaching**
- **Institutional Backing**: Official recognition and encouragement of innovative teaching practices

### Integration Opportunities with AI Tools:
**How AI-Powered Content + Small Group Meetings Could Transform the 50/50 Model:**

- **AI-Generated Content (Pre-Class)**: Students engage with personalized AI-created videos and materials before class
- **Small Group Facilitation (In-Class 50%)**: Use classroom time for small group discussions, problem-solving, and peer learning facilitated by the instructor
- **AI Avatar Support (Ongoing)**: 24/7 AI teaching assistants bridge the gap between pre-class study and in-class activities, answering questions and providing personalized guidance
- **Optimized Learning Cycle**: The combination creates a continuous learning cycle where AI handles content delivery and basic Q&A, while human instructors focus on higher-order thinking, group dynamics, and personalized mentoring

This policy alignment makes our AI workshop not just innovative, but **strategically essential** for maximizing the new GE framework's potential.

## The Problem: Traditional Video Production Pain Points

Despite the institutional support and clear pedagogical benefits, **significant barriers have prevented widespread flipped classroom adoption**:

### Core Pain Points:

**ðŸ’° Cost of Shooting and Editing Videos:**
- Professional video equipment and software licensing costs
- Time investment: 4-6 hours per video for scripting, recording, editing, and post-production
- Technical skill requirements creating entry barriers for many educators
- Ongoing maintenance and updates requiring repeated expensive processes

**ðŸ“º Making Video Materials Interactive and Engaging:**
- Static video lectures lack student engagement mechanisms
- No real-time feedback or personalized learning paths
- Difficulty tracking student comprehension and progress
- Limited ability to adapt content based on individual learning needs
- One-size-fits-all approach doesn't address diverse learning styles

**ðŸ”„ Scalability and Sustainability Challenges:**
- High production costs make it difficult to create comprehensive course libraries
- Updating content requires full re-production cycles
- Language barriers for international students with limited support options
- Lack of 24/7 student support for questions and clarification

### The Traditional Cycle of Frustration:
1. **Initial Enthusiasm**: Educators want to flip their classrooms
2. **Reality Check**: Face high costs and technical complexity  
3. **Compromise**: Create minimal video content or abandon the approach
4. **Missed Opportunity**: Students don't get the full benefits of flipped learning

**This is exactly where AI-powered tools become game-changers**, transforming every pain point into an opportunity for innovation and efficiency.

Relaxed attendance rules at Hong Kongâ€™s Baptist University will improve teaching quality

As a lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist Universityâ€™s Language Centre, I support the universityâ€™s recent decision to relax attendance requirements for all its students.

In the past, students skipping more than 30 per cent of classes would fail a course automatically. Under the new policy, they can still pass with less-than-perfect attendance records.

Despite its potential impact on studentsâ€™ class participation, this new policy may improve the overall quality of teaching and stimulate innovation among teaching staff at the university.

University students are young adults who should learn to make responsible decisions on how to spend their time. If they find a better way to study course materials than attending lectures, the university should respect their choices.

Also, under the new policy, all university faculty members must rethink how to attract students with more effective teaching, as their attendance is no longer guaranteed.

In the new semester, I will experiment with the flipped classroom approach in my English courses. Unlike conventional lectures where teachers present new material in class, I have created a series of video lectures students will watch in advance.

They can learn the basic concepts and techniques at their own pace through the videos and assigned reading. They can then discuss the material and receive my feedback on their thinking during classes. I have also created WhatsApp groups for my students to discuss course materials outside the classrooms.

First adopted by Professor Eric Mazur at Harvard in the 1990s, the flipped classrooms have recently gained much currency in higher education.

Through video lectures that cover basic course material, the classroom time spent with instructors can be saved for more demanding tasks that involve conceptual understanding and problem solving. This approach is particularly suitable for language teaching, as students can practise language skills more autonomously and receive guidance from their tutors to further improve their skills of independent language learning.

With the new attendance policy, Baptist University is well positioned to provide more resources to encourage faculty members to flip classrooms. Accessing course materials in videos, students can study anywhere using their mobile devices and juggle different commitments in more flexible schedules.

Through instant messengers such as WhatsApp, students and teachers can stay connected beyond the classrooms and even hold virtual class meetings in bad weather.
