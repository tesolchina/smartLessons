/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/presentations

I prepare some notes to prepare slides above

but the slides should be relatively simple -just a few bullet points

currently there are too many tabs

I want sth simpler - first overview and introduction - here I talk about the flipped classroom approach

then I focus on video generation - discuss the HeyGen approach first; then explore the difference between GUI and API -

After video generation: I talk about avatar interaction

here I explain the difference between text-based customised chatbot and multimodal avatar

after discussing the vendor solutions- we start exploring the in-house solutions through vibe coding (challenges facing non-experts and new models of collaboration)

so we should revise the overall structure of /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/components and index.html

but first let's have a plan



* **Slide 1:** Flipped classroom foundations
* **Slide 2:** HeyGen vs API approaches for video generation
* **Slide 3:** Text-based vs multimodal avatar interaction
* **Slide 4:** VibeCoding for non-experts and collaboration

it should be 4 tabs: each tab with one component - so we need to update /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCodingMac/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/components

we also need tab 5: Future collaboration roadmap (revise the wording a bit) 

yes this structure is simpler and better 

let's set up the overall page in index first 

slides content can be updated later 

demo can placeholders for now 


======feedback on the latest version =========

the font size too small

the layout too messy

I just want a simple slide presentation

under which there is some demo

Let's revise this a bit

the current set up is too narrow - which should make it wider

the slides are not working very well

the navigation bar at the top blocks part of the slides

============

Let's review the current codebase a bit
I'd like to focus more on the content first

so I'd like to look at an outline of my presentation

I'll use vibe coding to create more interactive materials

but for overview

I was reading some review articles on flipped classroom as well as my 2017 letter to the editor on lifting attendance requirement

https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/article/2109347/relaxed-attendance-rules-hong-kongs-baptist-university-will-improve

in terms of completing this project which is to prepare the talk /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/AItutor/Outreach/presentationWorkhop/docs/poster.jpg

I need to first decide what to cover in the talk

also I want to take the opportunity to invite more colleagues to join

when we decide the content - we should ask

- what are the key messages and arguments
- how can we demonstrate the potential of the tech
- what is the roadmap for developing a solid and practical solutions
