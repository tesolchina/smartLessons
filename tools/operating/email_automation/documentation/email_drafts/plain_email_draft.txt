SUBJECT: Quick Website Updates While We Plan the Revamp

Hi Hermine,

Hope you're doing well! I know the website revamp project has been delayed, and we should definitely catch up soon to get things back on track.

In the meantime, I was wondering if we could make a couple of quick updates to keep the current site fresh:

1. Remove the 2024 Conference Link
   - Where: Front page top bar
   - What: That link to the 2024 Conference (https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/main/lconference/)
   - Why: Since the conference is over, we should probably take it down

2. Update My Title
   - Where: My profile pages:
     * https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/main/simonwang/
     * https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/main/staff-english/
   - Change: From "Lecturer I" to "Lecturer I & Innovation Officer"
   - Why: I've been appointed as Innovation Officer, so it would be great to have this reflected

These are pretty small changes that shouldn't take much work - just quick fixes really.

Let me know if you need any more details for the technical team.

In a separate email, we'll discuss how to make some major changes to the front page, but these two items should be straightforward.

Looking forward to catching up about the website project soon!

Cheers,

Simon
