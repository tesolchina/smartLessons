          "context": "The LC’s mission, along with its objectives, and strategic direction, is crystally clear: educating HKBU students to become competent language users and effective communicators with three competencies: cognitive competence, interpersonal/cross-cultural competence, and intrapersonal competence. The center has been very successful in carrying out its mission and accomplishing its objectives with the right strategic direction. Based on my observation, a key reason for the centers’ success is that it has a strong and effective leadership team and highly energetic staff fully dedicated to the fulfilment of their mission and objectives. The center’s success should also be attributed to the excellent and efficient work of the various committees within the center created to assist in carrying out the different aspects of its mission. Of these committees, the Program Management Committee (PMC) and the Curriculum Committees of the four sections deserve special mention because they oversee the development and management of the academic programs and curriculums. In other words, these committees help establish and ensure the quality of the curricula and courses that the center offers. Furthermore, the LC has established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in its assessment, which are closely aligned with the University’s Institutional Strategic Plan. The KPIs cover 5 areas: Cognitive and communicative competency and teaching effectiveness; Interpersonal and cross-cultural competency; Intrapersonal competency; Innovative pedagogies including AI-assisted language learning and Staff development. In short, the LC is truly praiseworthy for 1) the successful accomplishment of its mission of helping HKBU students in their development as competent language users and 2) the effective provision of its academic services to the University.",

Given HKBU’s language policy shift from trilingualism (i.e., English, Cantonese, and Chinese/Putonghua) to multilingualism, it is suggested that the University make it a requirement for students to learn one other language (such as French, German, Japanese, or Spanish) in addition to the required 3 hours of Chinese offered by the LC. \n2. Due to the concern about the decline in students’ language proficiency, it is also recommended that the University adopt a minimum IELTS/ TOEFL score as a graduation requirement. These two recommendations, if adopted, should help address the concern of declining language proficiency at HKBU. As discussed with and confirmed by the VPTL, IELTS or TOEFL test will be used as an indicator of students’ proficiency in English – i.e. an IELTS score of 6.5 or a TOEFL ibt score of 79.

However, to increase required English credit hours will first need to a restructuring of the GE University Core curriculum. The LC is planning to seek the QAC’s support in reviewing and revamping the English curriculum so as to make the increase possible. Concerning Suggestion 2, the Foreign Languages section is now offering more 1000-level courses and also offer them on Saturdays to accommodate students’ schedule. As for Suggestion 3, The English section has revamped and renamed the course as “Nurturing Global Citizenship in English.” Based on students’ needs and requests, this revamped course places an emphasis on multimodal communication skills needed by today’s students, and it now includes many more interactive learning activities. The most prominent change in the course is arguably that it currently provides a context-enriched environment where students can practice language skills through making advocacy claims. Furthermore, the course is under constant renewal, and new linguistic elements are likely to be added in the future. Regarding Suggestion 4, the Chinese, English, and Putonghua sections are developing new practical Chinese, Putonghua and English courses on workplace communication will be designed and offered.",

The Writing Enhancement course will be replaced by Enhancing English through Global Citizenship with a focus on communicative skills in English and proficiency.

Additionally, many of the LC’s LEP courses are usually offered by the unit in a US university named variously as English Language Institute or, like the LC, Language Center. The main point to note here is that the LC, in spite of  being charged with such a diverse range of academic functions and services, has successfully accomplished its mission and objectives and also ensured that  the quality, scope, standard of the academic services it provides are in line with, if not exceeding, those provided by the corresponding units in a typical US university.",

Regarding the ACP’s suggestion for reviewing and lowering the average teaching load of the LC teaching staff, the center has been hoping and waiting for the Faculty of Arts to conduct this important review (for some time) and now for the VP of T&L office since the LC became a teaching unit directly under the VP of T&L office in July of 2024.",

Furthermore, the LC regularly holds research conferences, symposia, and seminars. For example, in 2024, the LC successfully organized two international conferences: one held in June with the title name: “Engagement in the Digital Age: International Conference on Language Teaching and Learning,” which drew 214 participants from 37 different universities as well as 32 LC presentations (English 17, Chinese 8, and Putonghua 4, Foreign Languages 3), and the other held in April with the title “The 17th Inner-institutional Symposium on Chinese Teaching in Tertiary Education” with 64 attendees in mixed mode.",

Specifically, it operates a Language Exchange Program and an Intercultural Immersive Exchange (IIE) Program as well as offers a Cultural Exchange Hybrid Course and two new courses that aim to help HKBU students  develop understandings of global citizenship (one course is titled “The World and Our Stories: Speak English with Friends around the World” and the other is entitled “Nurturing Global Citizenship through English.” The Language Exchange program pairs HKBU students with students from many different countries or with on-campus international students for lesson exchanges (i.e., to learn and teach target languages). From AY2021 to 2024, a total of 516 students participated in the Language Exchange  program and rated the program highly, with an average of 4.3/5 for its effectiveness in promoting culture exchange, and 4.4/5 for its ability to improve students’ understanding of another culture. The Intercultural Immersive Exchange (IIE) Program is designed to help students practice global citizenship and develop their sustainable thinking by exploring sustainable development goals (SDGs) through subsidized summer exchanges to various countries across the world. 87 students have participated in this program, with 40 of them having gone to Asian countries, 12 to North America, and 35 to Europe.  The Cultural Exchange Hybrid course is an innovative supplementary course designed to assist HKBU’s outgoing and incoming exchange students as well as local students wishing to interact more easily with international students on exchange programs in Hong Kong.",
