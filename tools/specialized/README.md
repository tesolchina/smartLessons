Specialized scripts migrated from the former \"projects/\" tree on 2025-09-12T06:20:10Z.

Purpose:
- Quarantine area for domain-specific or one-off project scripts.
- Future refactor: identify reusable logic, extract into categorized tool modules.
- Preserve original relative paths beneath each project root for traceability.

Recommended Next Steps:
1. Prioritize high-impact scripts (frequency, reusability, complexity) for extraction.
2. Add lightweight tests before refactoring logic into core tool namespaces.
3. Normalize imports to the packaged \"dailyassistant\" namespace (no relative traversal up out of this tree).
4. Mark fully migrated scripts with a header comment and optionally remove them after stable extraction.
