# Daily Assistant Project

The idea is to use this tool to engage GitHub Copilot to run daily tasks efficiently.

## Plan 1: Email Automation System


### Overview

Set up an automated email drafting and sending system that can handle routine communications.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Draft Generation**: Use AI to create email drafts based on templates and context
- **Storage**: Save drafts in `email_drafts/` folder with structured naming
- **Cross-Platform Sending**:
  - **macOS**: Use AppleScript to integrate with Mail.app or Outlook
  - **Windows**: Use PowerShell scripts to interface with Outlook COM objects
- **Template System**: Create reusable email templates for common tasks
- **Scheduling**: Implement delayed sending capabilities

### Technical Components

- Python scripts for draft generation and data processing
- AppleScript/PowerShell for email client integration
- JSON/YAML configuration files for email templates
- Scheduling system (cron jobs or task scheduler)

## Plan 2: Obsidian Integration System

### Overview

Automatically sync and update notes between this assistant and Obsidian vault.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Vault Connection**: Connect to local Obsidian vault directory
- **Note Generation**: Create structured notes based on daily activities
- **Bi-directional Sync**: Read existing notes and update them with new information
- **Link Management**: Maintain proper internal linking structure
- **Template Integration**: Use Obsidian templates for consistent formatting

### Technical Components

- File system monitoring for real-time sync
- Markdown parsing and generation
- Obsidian plugin integration (optional)
- Metadata management (frontmatter, tags, dates)
- Backup and version control for notes

## Current Assets

- Email drafts folder structure already exists
- Web crawling tools available for data collection
- Existing folder organization system in place

## Next Steps

1. Set up email template system
2. Create AppleScript/PowerShell integration
3. Establish Obsidian vault connection
4. Implement automated workflows
5. Test cross-platform compatibility
