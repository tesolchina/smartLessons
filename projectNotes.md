Simon's note for AI- do not edit; could reformat

let's propose some quick fix

the current carousal posters are messy and overwhelming we should remove them and put them in toggles

meanwhile we should add our LC corporate video to the front page as well as a short message the LC head with her photo https://lc.hkbu.edu.hk/main/lconference/

AI: can you draft a proposal and a prototype - we can host it in smartlessons.hkbu.tech/lc/demo.index we need to later push the page to https://github.com/tesolchina/smartLessons/
