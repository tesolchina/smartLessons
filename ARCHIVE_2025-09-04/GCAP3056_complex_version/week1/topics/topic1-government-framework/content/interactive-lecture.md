# Interactive Lecture: Accountability, Transparency & Access to Information

üóûÔ∏è **Accountability, Transparency, and the Power of Letters**

In this module, explore why government must be kept in check, how information access supports accountability, and how ordinary people (including you!) can join public debate via Letters to the Editor.

## 1. Government is a "necessary evil"

The phrase "Government is a necessary evil" sounds like a paradox. Why do people say this?

Government has the power to:
- Collect taxes from citizens
- Make laws that restrict what we can do
- Use force to enforce those laws
- Control various aspects of our daily lives

Yet we need government to:
- Maintain order and safety
- Provide public services
- Protect individual rights
- Ensure fair treatment for all citizens

### Interactive Question 1: Multiple Choice

## 3. Code on Access to Information

The Hong Kong Government's [Code on Access to Information](https://www.access.gov.hk/en/codeonacctoinfo/index.html) is a policy that lets any member of the public request information from government departments.

**Key Features:**
- The government must inform the public about its services and policy decisions
- Information can be provided routinely or upon request, unless there are specific reasons to refuse (like privacy, security, or legal restrictions)
- Requests should be handled **promptly and helpfully**. If unclear, the department will contact you for clarification
- There are procedures for **review or complaint** if you believe the Code was not properly applied
- The Code is available online: [access.gov.hk](http://www.access.gov.hk)

### Interactive Question 4: Multiple Choice
**What can you do if your information request is refused?**

### Simon's Letter Example

[TOGGLE-SECTION id="simonLetter" title="Read Simon's Published Letter"]

**From Dr. Simon Wang:**

I started writing to the Letters section in 2013 and have published over 100 letters. Since 2020, I have also been working with my colleague, Dr Benedict Rowlett, at Baptist University, helping over 300 students to publish nearly 140 letters.

Our conversation with the government extended beyond the newspaper. We met Legislative Council members including Chan Kin-por, Alice Mak Mei-kuen, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Tse Wai-chuen, and brought their attention to the challenges facing groups whose voices are less often heard. The letters section lets us share our conversations with lawmakers and create additional pressure for government action.
