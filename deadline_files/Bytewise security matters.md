### email discussion 
I am writing to follow up on the vScan security assessment for Bytewise, our AI chatbot application designed to support teaching and learning at HKBU.

  

We are currently in the UAT phase, and I’m pleased to share that, with the kind support of Mr. Pak Shing CHU from ITO, the BUAM SSOid integration has been successfully configured in the UAT environment. The system is now ready for identity verification and single sign-on testing.

  

As the next critical step toward secure production deployment, we understand that a vScan assessment is required prior to full BUAM integration. We fully recognize the importance of adhering to HKBU’s information security policies — especially for systems involving user authentication and access control.

  

While the application is currently hosted externally to ensure stable connectivity with essential AI model APIs (which are not consistently accessible within Hong Kong), our priority is not to revisit past deployment decisions, but to move forward constructively by completing all necessary security reviews. We are committed to full compliance and view vScan as a key step in that process.

  

Could you kindly advise on:

1. Any forms, network access, or technical documentation required from our side;
2. Whether the scan can be conducted against our UAT endpoint (we can provide secure access to test accounts and technical details as needed).

  

We are ready to cooperate fully and respond promptly to help ensure a smooth assessment process. Your guidance and support would be greatly appreciated as we work toward a secure and successful integration.
