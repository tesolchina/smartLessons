To: PMC Members From: Dr Simon Wang, Innovation Officer Date: 18 Aug 2025 Subject: Principles and Direction for AI-Enabled Practices (LC Website as Starting Point) 

Overview Our current AI, content, and analytics efforts are fragmented and document-heavy (PDF-first), limiting discoverability, accessibility, and reuse. Data sits in silos, making cross-system reporting manual and slow. Staff spend time reformatting and reconciling information rather than analyzing and improving services. By aligning on clear principles, starting with a website revamp, and phasing work across existing platforms (LCMIS, Bytewise), we can convert scattered efforts into a coordinated program that improves productivity, governance, and decision-making. 

Purpose 

- Seek PMC endorsement of: 
	- Three action-oriented principles for AI-enabled practices 
	- LC website revamp as the starting initiative 
	- A phased direction (details to be worked out post-endorsement) 
    

Core Principles (for endorsement) 

1. Make content machine-readable by default: Produce, maintain, and publish instructional and administrative documents in accessible, searchable, and reusable formats. 

2. Connect and govern shared, linkable data: Enable, standardize, and secure cross-system data linkage for authorized staff, with strict privacy, security, and audit controls. 
3. Embed AI assistance with human oversight: Apply AI to draft, summarize, analyze, and report; require staff to review, verify, and sign off. 

Point of Departure 
- Revamp the LC website: deliver a standard public page for every course/program and maintain richer internal records. 
- Rationale: immediate gains in visibility and accessibility; establishes structured data for AI and reporting. 
Platforms to Leverage 
- LCMIS: use as the system of record; integrate read-only data and unify identifiers. 
- Bytewise: deploy approved-corpus AI Q&A with access control and citations. 

Phased Direction 

- Phase 1: Adopt principles and run a small pilot (public pages + internal records). 
- Phase 2: Scale and standardize (templates, metadata, governance). 
- Phase 3: Operationalize with metrics (routine AI-assisted drafting/reporting). 
- Phase 4: Roll out the Call Centre chatbot (pilot → limited launch → full release). 
    

Guardrails 
- Privacy and compliance: enforce least privilege, prevent exposure of sensitive data, and maintain audit trails. 
- Human in the loop: require staff review for public content and external responses during pilots. 
- Change control: manage versions and schedule periodic reviews. 

Ask to PMC 

- Endorse the three principles and the website revamp as the starting point. 
- Authorize key technical/content contributors (LCMIS read-only sync, knowledge base curation, access controls).
- Nominate content owners for 5–10 pilot courses/programs. 
- Agree to a 60-day checkpoint for progress and next steps. 
    

Expected Benefits 

- Faster, more consistent documents and reports. 
- Improved public presence and accessibility. 
- Better data linkage to support decisions and impact narratives.
