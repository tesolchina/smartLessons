[[embed avatar]] - need to follow up 


Had a meeting with [[Kaitai Zhang]]  [[2025-08-22]] 
we agree that the priority is to develop an avatar using our own tech
the goal for Sept is to 
- set up an animated photo to talk 
- text-to-speech engine (low API costs)
- speech-to-text engine (low API costs) 
- button to control whose turn to talk and potentially allow multiple person to talk with multiple avatars
