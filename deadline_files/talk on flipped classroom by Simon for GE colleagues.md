Video generation feature of Bytewise for flipped classroom #email_head  

**Engaging Students in Flipped Classroom with AI-assisted Video Generation and Streaming Avatars** 

The flipped classroom approach has been actively promoted at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), particularly among General Education (GE) course instructors seeking to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. This presentation introduces two innovative features developed using the AI video platform HeyGen. First, instructors can easily generate customized video lectures by completing a simple form and outlining students’ learning needs; the platform then automatically creates a video lesson based on collaboratively prepared scripts between teacher and AI. Second, a dynamic video streaming avatar is created to interact with students in real time, answering their questions and facilitating speaking practice tasks related to the video lectures. These AI-powered tools streamline content creation and foster interactive, personalized learning experiences in the flipped classroom.

the primary objective of this talk is to recruit more teachers to join me and start using my products 
I need to communicate with Kai Tai [[Kaitai Zhang]] about this 

the current features 

some features that we can develop and deliver 


I think for this form thing to work- we'll need to modify the Bytewise UI a bit [[Bytewise Chatbot platform]] 
I'll use [[poe app creator]] to develop a few slides - although this is not as prioritised as [[Week 1-3 Fall 2025]] prep - but I need to keep this in mind 

but I need to give some thoughts to this
