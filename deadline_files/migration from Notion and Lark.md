Absolutely, migrating from Lark (ByteDance's collaboration tool, similar to a mix of Slack and docs) and Notion to Obsidian is a smart move, especially given your positive experience with Obsidian's simple Markdown format and powerful connections. Both Lark and Notion support exporting data in formats that play well with Obsidian (e.g., Markdown or CSV), making the process relatively straightforward. This will help consolidate your GTD workflow (daily notes, #deadline/#toSchedule tags, person-specific notes, etc.) into one sustainable system, reducing the risk of missing things across apps.
 
**Key Warnings Before Starting:**

- **Backup Everything:** Before exporting, make local copies of your data in Lark and Notion to avoid loss. Exports can sometimes miss embedded content like images or attachments.
- **Test Small First:** Export a single page/note from each app, import to Obsidian, and verify before doing a full migration.
- **Time Estimate:** This could take 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on your data volume.
- **Obsidian Prep:** Ensure your Obsidian vault is set up with Sync (as you've done) for easy access across devices. Create a new folder in your vault (e.g., "Imported Data") to organize migrated content without cluttering your main setup.
- **Limitations:** Not all features transfer perfectly (e.g., Notion databases become tables/lists; Lark's real-time collab won't carry over). You'll need to manually refine links, tags, and structures in Obsidian.

I'll break this down step by step: exporting from each app, then migrating to Obsidian. If your data includes sensitive info (e.g., student/colleague notes), review privacy during export.

### Step 1: Export Data from Notion

Notion exports cleanly to Markdown, which Obsidian reads nativelyâ€”great for preserving formatting, links, and tasks.

1. **Log In to Notion:** Open Notion on web or desktop app (exports work best on web).
2. **Select What to Export:**
    - For a full workspace: Go to **Settings & Members** (top-right) > **Settings** > Scroll to "Export content" > Click **Export all workspace content**.
    - For specific pages/databases: Open the page > Click the â€¢â€¢â€¢ menu (top-right) > **Export** > Choose format.
3. **Choose Export Options:**
    - Format: Select **Markdown & CSV** (best for Obsidianâ€”pages become .md files, databases become CSV).
    - Include: Check "Include subpages" and "Include databases" to get everything.
    - If you have databases (e.g., task trackers), they'll export as CSV files with columns intact.
4. **Download the Export:**
    - Click **Export**â€”Notion will email you a link (or download directly for small exports).
    - Unzip the downloaded file. You'll get a folder structure with .md files (for pages) and .csv files (for databases), plus any attachments (images, etc.).
5. **Handle Large Exports:** If your workspace is big, export in batches (e.g., one database at a time) to avoid timeouts.

Example: A Notion page with tasks might export as a .md file like:

```
# My Tasks
- [ ] Task 1 #deadline
- [ ] Task 2 #toSchedule
```

### Step 2: Export Data from Lark

Lark (also known as Feishu in some regions) focuses on docs, chats, and wikis. Exporting is more limited than Notion but doable via their docs or base (database) features. If your data is in chats, it may require manual copying.

1. **Log In to Lark:** Use the web version (larksuite.com) or desktop app for easier exports.
2. **Export Docs/Wikis:**
    - Open a doc or wiki page.
    - Click the â€¢â€¢â€¢ menu (top-right) > **Export** > Choose **Markdown** (if available) or **PDF/Word** (Markdown is ideal for Obsidian; if not, use Word and convert later).
    - For multiple docs: Lark doesn't have a one-click full export like Notion. You'll need to export individually or use their "Space" export if it's a team wiki.
        - Go to your Space > Settings > Export (if admin). This may give a ZIP of docs in HTML/Markdown.
3. **Export Bases (Databases/Tables):**
    - Open a Base (Lark's database tool).
    - Click **Share/Export** (top-right) > **Export to CSV** or **Excel**.
    - This preserves tables (e.g., task lists with deadlines).
4. **Export Chats/Other Content:**
    - For chat histories (if that's where ideas are): Lark allows exporting chat logs via **Chat settings > Export chat history** (as text or CSV). Copy-paste manually if needed.
    - Attachments: Download individually from docs/chats.
5. **Download and Organize:**
    - Save all exports to a folder on your computer (e.g., Desktop > Lark Export).
    - If exports are in non-Markdown formats (e.g., Word/PDF), convert them:
        - Use a free tool like Pandoc (download from pandoc.org) via command line: `pandoc input.docx -o output.md`.
        - Or online converters like CloudConvert.

Example: A Lark doc might export as a .md file with similar structure to Notion, ready for Obsidian.

### Step 3: Migrate the Exported Data to Obsidian

Now, import into your Obsidian vault. Since everything is Markdown-based, it's mostly drag-and-drop.

1. **Prepare Your Obsidian Vault:**
    
    - Open Obsidian on your device (e.g., Windows PC).
    - Create a new folder in your vault: Right-click in the file explorer (left sidebar) > New folder > Name it "Imported" (with subfolders like "From Notion" and "From Lark").
    - If using Obsidian Sync, ensure it's enabledâ€”the imports will sync automatically.
2. **Import the Files:**
    
    - Open File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).
    - Drag the exported .md files from Notion/Lark into your Obsidian vault's "Imported" folder.
    - For CSV files (from databases/bases):
        - Open the CSV in a text editor (e.g., Notepad) and convert to Markdown tables manually, or use Obsidian's table editor.
        - Paste into a new .md note: Use `|` for columns (e.g., `| Task | Deadline |`).
        - Plugins like **Advanced Tables** (install via Community Plugins) can help import CSVs directly.
    - For attachments/images: Drag them into the vault folder. In Obsidian, link them with `![Image](path/to/image.jpg)`.
3. **Clean Up and Integrate:**
    
    - Open imported notes in Obsidianâ€”formatting should look good, but fix any broken links (e.g., Notion internal links become plain text; manually convert to Obsidian wiki-links like `[[Page Name]]`).
    - Apply Your Tags/Structure:
        - Search/replace to add your GTD tags (e.g., turn Notion "Due" properties into #deadline).
        - Link to existing notes (e.g., if a imported task mentions a student, add `[[Student-Jane]]`).
        - For tasks: Convert to checkboxes (`- [ ] Task`).
    - Merge with Existing Setup: Move relevant content to your daily notes, person-specific notes, or dashboard. Use Dataview queries to pull imported tasks (e.g., `TASK WHERE contains(text, "#deadline")`).
    - Handle Databases: If you had Notion/Lark tables for tasks/schedules, recreate as Obsidian notes with tables or use the **Dataview** plugin for dynamic lists.
4. **Test and Sync:**
    
    - Create a test link between an imported note and your GTD hub (e.g., dashboard).
    - If using Obsidian Sync, make a change and verify it appears on other devices (e.g., iPhone).
    - Use the graph view (View > Open graph view) to see how imported data connectsâ€”powerful for your "connections" appreciation!

### Step 4: Post-Migration Tips for Sustainability

- **Refine Gradually:** Don't overhaul everything at onceâ€”spend 15 minutes daily integrating (e.g., tag 10 imported tasks with #toSchedule).
- **Plugins to Help:**
    - **Importer** (community plugin): Automates some Notion imports.
    - **Tasks** or **Dataview**: For querying migrated tasks/deadlines.
- **AI Copilot Integration:** Use your OpenRouter setup to review imports (prompt: "Organize these migrated tasks with #scheduled tags").
- **Calendar Tie-In:** Export any Notion/Lark calendars as ICS files and import to your main calendar, then link in Obsidian.
- **Archive Originals:** Keep the export ZIPs as backups, but delete from Lark/Notion if you're fully migrating (after verifying).
- **Common Issues:** If links/images break, re-embed them. For large migrations, Obsidian might lagâ€”split into smaller folders.

This should get all your data into Obsidian smoothly, enhancing your setup without losing the "simple but powerful" feel. Compared to Lark/Notion's structured (sometimes rigid) interfaces, Obsidian's flexibility will let you customize further (e.g., linking imported colleague notes directly). If you encounter issues (e.g., with specific file types), share details, and I'll refine the steps. Or if you'd like a visual migration flowchart (as responsive HTML), explicitly request it!
