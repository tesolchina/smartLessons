## Technical Notes

- All content files are structured as standalone HTML pages
- The main `index.html` uses JavaScript to dynamically load content
- Shared CSS and JS files are located in their respective folders
- Content loads into the designated `contentArea` div for seamless navigation

## Usage

Students access the week through the main `index.html` file, which provides an overview and navigation to the three activity areas. Content is loaded dynamically for a smooth user experience while maintaining the ability to access individual sections directly if needed.
