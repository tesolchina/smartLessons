## Technical Implementation

### Markdown-to-HTML System
Each HTML page dynamically loads and renders its corresponding markdown file:

1. **Fetch**: JavaScript fetches the markdown file from the `content/` folder
2. **Parse**: Custom `parseMarkdown()` function converts markdown to styled HTML
3. **Render**: Content is inserted into the page with Tailwind CSS styling
4. **Progress**: Local storage tracks completion of each activity

### Benefits of This Structure

#### For Content Creators
- **Easy Editing**: Content is in simple markdown format
- **Version Control**: Markdown files can be tracked in git
- **Collaborative**: Multiple people can edit content simultaneously
- **Flexible**: Easy to add, remove, or reorganize content

#### For Students
- **Clear Navigation**: Topic-based organization matches learning progression
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators show completion status
- **Consistent Experience**: Same interface across all content types
- **Offline Capable**: Content cached for better performance

#### For Developers
- **Maintainable**: Separation of content and presentation
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new topics or activities
- **Reusable**: Template system for consistent page structure
- **Modern**: Uses current web standards and best practices
