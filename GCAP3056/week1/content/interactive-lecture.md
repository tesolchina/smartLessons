valid_answers: tax,public money,funded,taxpayer
feedback_correct: ‚úÖ Correct! Government accountability is essential because they use public money.

## Section 3: Code on Access to Information

content: The Hong Kong Government's [Code on Access to Information](https://www.access.gov.hk/en/codeonacctoinfo/index.html) is a policy that lets any member of the public request information from government departments.

### Key Points

- The government must inform the public about its services and policy decisions.
- Information can be provided routinely or upon request, unless there are specific reasons to refuse (like privacy, security, or legal restrictions).
- Requests should be handled **promptly and helpfully**. If unclear, the department will contact you for clarification.
- There are procedures for **review or complaint** if you believe the Code was not properly applied.
- The Code is available online: [access.gov.hk](http://www.access.gov.hk)

### MC Question 3

question: Quick Quiz: What can you do if your information request is refused?
options:

- A. Give up and accept the refusal. | false
- B. Ask for a review or make a complaint. | true
- C. Wait for one year and ask again. | false
  feedback_correct: ‚úÖ Correct! You can request a review or complain.
  feedback_incorrect: ‚ùå Not quite. You can always ask for a review or make a complaint.

### Note

content: **Note:** The Code defines what info can be released, and sets a **time frame** for reply (usually 10 days, up to 21 days for complex cases). If refused, you can ask for a review or complain to the Ombudsman. [Learn more here](https://www.access.gov.hk/en/codeonacctoinfo/index.html).

## Section 4: Video Review

title: Video: Access to Information (Critical Review)
video_url: https://www.youtube.com/embed/_hgEeVjRf2A
content: **Critical Review:** The official video explains the basics of requesting information from the Hong Kong government, but it misses several vital points:

### Critical Points

- It **does not mention** the official **time frame** for government replies (normally within 10 days, extendable to 21 days).
- It **omits** the right to request a review or complain to the Ombudsman if your request is refused or delayed.
- It gives examples, but does not explain what types of information may be refused (privacy, security, etc.).

### Reflection Exercise

## Section 5: Letters to the Editor

title: Letters to the Editor: Your Voice Matters
content: Letters to the Editor, like those in the [South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/comment/letters/), bridge the gap between the public and the "ivory tower." Anyone can write, share opinions, and influence public debate‚Äîeven students!

## Simon's Letter Section

toggle_title: Read Simon's Published Letter
content: I started writing to the Letters section in 2013 and have published over 100 letters. Since 2020, I have also been working with my colleague, Dr Benedict Rowlett, at Baptist University, helping over 300 students to publish nearly 140 letters.

Our conversation with the government extended beyond the newspaper. We met Legislative Council members including Chan Kin-por, Alice Mak Mei-kuen, Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee and Tse Wai-chuen, and brought their attention to the challenges facing groups whose voices are less often heard. The letters section lets us share our conversations with lawmakers and create additional pressure for government action.
