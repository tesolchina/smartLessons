we need to find a folder on google slide that allow us to create slides 

we should place this folder under /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating and describe how it works 

the scripts in the folder should be generic taking in some input files and instructions to generate slides and upload them to Google drive- preferably turn them into Google slides not MS PPT
