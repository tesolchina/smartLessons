this folder is very messy

there are scripts for searching email and sending email (with or without confiramation)

some are generic and others are tailormade

I'd like you to go through the scripts and files and remove those scripts for special purposes and create or revise scripts for general purposes 

we need a workflow to work with mail.app in mac so it can locate email, and identify them and send reply 

we may need to have a file to keep colleagues and students' email address

 we need a good solution in a organised directory 

thanks
