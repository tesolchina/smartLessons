Subject: Re: Departmental Meeting - New Service Learning Course - Google Slides Ready

Dear Nancy and Joshua,

I hope this email finds you well.

Following our discussion about the new Service Learning course and the upcoming departmental meeting, I've prepared a collaborative Google Slides presentation for our joint sharing session.

ðŸ”— **Google Slides Link:** https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_6aRzEFlUnvTPSSG5vtgFTKhxo5NpajnynDekjiiNgs/edit?usp=sharing

**Presentation Structure:**
1. Title slide with all three presenters (Dr. Joshua Chan, Dr. Nancy Guo, Dr. Simon Wang)
2. Dr. Joshua Chan's section - Service Learning methodology and community engagement
3. Dr. Nancy Guo's section - Language learning in service contexts
4. Dr. Simon Wang's section - LANG 2077: Language Skills for Human-AI Partnership
5. Discussion and Q&A slide

**Key Features:**
â€¢ Anyone with the link can edit (perfect for collaboration)
â€¢ Colorful, professional design with HKBU branding
â€¢ Structured content with placeholders for each presenter
â€¢ Ready for our departmental presentation

Please feel free to:
- Add your specific content to your respective sections
- Modify the design or layout as needed  
- Share additional feedback or suggestions

The presentation is set up so we can work on it collaboratively before the departmental meeting. I've included placeholder content that you can replace with your own materials.

Looking forward to our collaborative presentation and the positive impact our Service Learning initiatives will have on student learning.

Best regards,
Simon
