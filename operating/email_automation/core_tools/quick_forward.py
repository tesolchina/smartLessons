    3. **Search for**: "Logs Panel"
    4. **Look for subject**: "Logs Panel, Automatic Image Updates, Database Credentials & Extensions, SMTP"
    5. **Select the email** and click Forward (‚åòF)
    6. **Enter recipient**: hswanghk@gmail.com
    7. **Send the forward**
    8. **Archive the original**: Right-click ‚Üí Archive (or drag to Archive folder)
    
    ## Alternative AppleScript Commands
    
    You can also run these commands in Script Editor:
    
    ```applescript
    tell application "Mail"
        -- Search command
        set searchResults to (every message whose subject contains "Logs Panel")
        -- Then manually process the results
