Dear Sophie,

Thank you for letting me know about your absence from today's lesson. I hope you have a speedy recovery and feel better soon.

Please make sure to refer to the course notes and materials available here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1efLZhPk1i5Hdlg2rQ2vfoR-ccFUMkJkYSj7rPSVSXNU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.emudfpxxf0y2

**Important reminder**: Please pay special attention to the pre-course writing test which is **DUE September 12th**. This is a crucial requirement for the course.

I also want to caution you that this section currently has only 10 students enrolled and may be subject to cancellation if enrollment doesn't increase.
