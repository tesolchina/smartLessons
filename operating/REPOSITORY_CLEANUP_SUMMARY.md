# Repository Cleanup Summary - September 10, 2025

## ✅ Large Files Removal and .gitignore Update

### **Problem Addressed**
The repository contained numerous large files (268MB video, 69MB PowerPoint, audio files, documents) that exceeded GitHub's size limits and caused push failures.

### **Actions Taken**

#### 1. **Updated .gitignore**
Added comprehensive exclusions for large file types:
```
# Large media files
*.mov *.mp4 *.mp3 *.wav *.avi *.mkv *.wmv
*.pptx *.ppt

# Large document files  
*.pdf *.docx *.doc

# Archive files
*.zip *.rar *.tar *.gz
```

#### 2. **Removed Files from Git Repository**
- **176 files deleted** from version control
- **98,029 deletions** in total content
- Large files now ignored but preserved locally
- Repository size dramatically reduced

#### 3. **Successfully Pushed to GitHub**
- All changes committed and pushed successfully
- No more size limit errors
- Repository now optimized for collaboration

### **Files Categories Removed**
1. **Media Files**: .mov videos (268MB), .mp3 audio files (15-19MB each)
2. **Office Documents**: .pptx presentations, .pdf reports, .docx documents  
3. **Archive Files**: .zip packages and compressed files
4. **System Files**: .DS_Store, __pycache__ folders, .env files
5. **Git Submodules**: Embedded repositories causing warnings

### **Current Repository State**
- **Status**: Clean and optimized ✅
- **Size**: Significantly reduced 
- **Large Files**: Preserved locally but ignored by git
- **Collaboration Ready**: No size barriers for team members

### **Files Still Available Locally**
Large files remain on your local system for reference:
- LC departmental meeting materials
- Screening test audio files  
- Course materials and presentations
- All project documents

### **Future Prevention**
- .gitignore now prevents accidental large file commits
- Repository focused on code, configurations, and text files
- Media and document files excluded automatically
