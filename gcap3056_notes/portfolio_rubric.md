# Community Engagement Portfolio: Goals & Rubric

## üìù Description (40%)

This portfolio is the public-facing component of the term project, where students adapt their Argumentative Research Paper for community engagement. The goal is to translate in-depth research into accessible formats to influence public opinion and policy. The portfolio must include:

- **Public Submission:** Evidence of submitting the full research paper to a relevant public body (e.g., a Legco member's office, a government department).
- **Public-Facing Derivative:** One piece of content that translates the paper's core argument for a broader audience (e.g., an infographic, a video, or a letter to the editor for a newspaper like SCMP).
- **Lawmaker Presentation:** The slide deck or recording from the group's presentation to a lawmaker.
