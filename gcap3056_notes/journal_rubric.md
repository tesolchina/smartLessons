# Reflective Learning Journal: Goals & Rubric

## üìù Description (35%)

The reflective journal is an individual component where students document and reflect on their entire term project journey‚Äîfrom initial research to public engagement.

Students should keep a multimodal journal (writing, voice-recording, etc.) to analyze their work process, team collaboration, and learning milestones. The drafts of these journals should be shared in a discussion board in Moodle for peer learning.
